Research Infrastructure: LIGO Laboratory Operations and Maintenance 2024-2028 -- Exploring the Gravitational-Wave Cosmos,"Researchers at NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) seek to observe and understand gravitational waves. Gravitational waves (GWs) are oscillations in space and time that are generated whenever mass moves suddenly. They can carry information about cosmic catastrophes, such as the collisions of black holes and neutron stars. Since 2015, LIGO has observed more than one hundred GW events, revealing entirely new information about these exotic objects, which are located tens or hundreds of millions of light years away. This award will enable LIGO to search for additional GW signals and to improve LIGO’s sensitivity so that it can observe even more distant cataclysms. LIGO is the world’s premier gravitational wave observatory. It is a key part of an emerging global network of similar detectors. These are now in operation or under development in Italy (Virgo), Japan (KAGRA), and India (LIGO India). Concurrent measurements by LIGO, Virgo, and optical, radio, and X-ray observatories have inaugurated the era of multi-messenger astronomy, where synergistic detections of gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves reveal entirely new and exciting information about the cosmos. LIGO’s historic GW observations were recognized by the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics to LIGO pioneers Barry Barish, Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss. This award will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advance the multidisciplinary application of LIGO-related technology, and it will disseminate information about LIGO-related science and technology to the general public. This award will fund the operation of the existing LIGO apparatus, as well as installation, commissioning, and operation of enhancements to the apparatus that will improve LIGO’s sensitivity. This, and related research activities, will create continued opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between LIGO staff members, post-docs, and students, and the approximately 1400 researchers and students at 127 universities world-wide that collaborate with LIGO. Funding is provided for the continued operation of the LIGO observatories at Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, the associated science and engineering support programs at Caltech and MIT, and for carrying out education and public outreach programs that disseminate information about LIGO. Funding will be awarded through a new cooperative agreement for the period from January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2028. The effort includes: • Maintenance and operation of the LIGO sites and interferometers, • Commissioning the interferometers to enhance their sensitivity to GWs, • Conducting astrophysical data analysis and detector characterization to discriminate GW signals from noise sources, • Carrying out research and development to enhance detector sensitivity beyond the current design performance, • Curation of LIGO data and its dissemination to the broader research community, • Provision of software and computing resources to LIGO, and the development of new computing tools and methods that extend LIGOs data analysis capabilities, and • Continuation of the vibrant observatory-based LIGO education and public outreach program. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",250000000,2024,2028,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
Management and Operations of the Green Bank Observatory FY 2025 - FY 2026,"Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI) will manage and operate the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2026. As part of this project, AUI will initiate a critically-needed infrastructure refurbishment plan to ensure the long-term safety and scientific vitality of GBO. Furthermore, it will reintegrate GBO into the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) to realize a coherent vision of service to the radio astronomy community, with a renewed emphasis on improving scientific capability, user support, archival data access, and software tools. Astronomy is an important element in meeting national goals related to diversity, science and technology education, and increased U.S. competitiveness. GBO’s exemplary education and public outreach programs in West Virginia will create unique STEM learning experiences for K– 16 students, educators, professional scientists, and the public. The Green Bank Science Center attracts nearly 40,000 visitors each year, and active telescopes on site provide invaluable training opportunities for students, as well as science enrichment for a very wide demographic. Driven by the priorities of the U.S. research community as articulated in the 2020 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, GBO will enable important discoveries across many fields of astronomy and astrophysics. The major research instrument at GBO is the 100-meter diameter Green Bank Telescope (GBT)---the world's largest fully steerable single-dish radio telescope. The GBT's large sky coverage, very high sensitivity, and extensive suite of instruments make it a powerful and versatile telescope which enables advances in virtually all areas of modern astrophysics. Some major studies enabled by the GBT will include: characterizing the low-frequency gravitational wave background; determining the nature and complex environments of mysterious fast radio bursts; establishing the chemical inventory of molecular clouds and evolved stars to elucidate the growth of molecular complexity in space; measuring the distribution of superheated gas in the intercluster medium of galaxy clusters; and scanning nearby stars, the Galactic Plane, and external galaxies for technosignatures. The GBT offers excellent complementarity and synergy with interferometric arrays, such as the Very Large Array, the Very Long Baseline Array, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. It also plays a critical role as a highly sensitive element of very long baseline interferometry. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",29367660,2024,2026,NSF,United States,United States,Information and Computing Sciences; Astronomical Sciences

Equipment: Cosmic Explorer Beamtube Experiment,"The 2015 discovery and ongoing observations of gravitational waves by NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) have transformed mankind's perception of the Universe, revolutionizing modern astrophysics, cosmology, and general relativity. Upgrades to the 4-kilometer LIGO detectors continue to expand their horizons, but LIGO can ultimately only access the local gravitational neighborhood. To achieve a cosmological reach, complement traditional modes of observation, and gravitationally probe the Universe back to its infancy will require larger-scale “next-generation” interferometers. The planned Cosmic Explorer (CE) Observatory, ten times larger than LIGO, will maintain and advance US leadership in this revolutionary new field. However, constructing the 40-km ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) laser beamtubes needed to realize CE represents a key technical challenge. This award will support the development and testing of scalable technology to implement high-performance, reliable, and economical vacuum beamtubes at the largest physical scale ever attempted, on a timescale compatible with CE construction and observations. By helping to enable CE, the Cosmic Explorer Beamtube Experiment (CEBEX) advances gravitational wave observational science, while projecting novel studies of ultrahigh vacuum environments for physical science research, manufacturing technology, and surface science into new realms. Under this award, the CEBEX team, based at LIGO Hanford Observatory, will design, construct, and test a 1.2m diameter by 120m long prototype UHV beamtube section as a technology pathfinder for the CE observatory. The scale of this activity requires the construction of a purpose-built lab structure on available land at the current LIGO site. Beamtube materials, construction methods, and industrial processes will be implemented and tested to confirm feasibility, scalability, and compliance with CE requirements. In the final year of the planned 4.25-year Award, the team will apply the results of this research to deliver to NSF an efficient conceptual reference design, parametric cost estimate, and schedule framework for CE beamtube construction. These will form key underpinnings of pending future CE design and construction initiatives. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",17678372,2024,2028,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
Astrocent Plus -- Particle Astrophysics Science and Technology Centre,"The prime objective of the project is to uplift the existing Centre of Excellence AstroCeNT by transforming it into a fully independent, interdisciplinary, new legal entity: “Astrocent Plus — Particle Astrophysics Science and Technology Centre”. Astrocent Plus will engage in cutting-edge research and development in astroparticle physics and in related aspects of innovative technology, addressing global challenges, such as healthcare, climate change and sustainable sources of energy. As a fully autonomous entity with a modern professional management and administrative structure, it will be the first scientific institution in astroparticle physics supported by Teaming for Excellence and the first one in the field in Poland. Acting in close cooperation with world-leading consortium partners, Astrocent Plus will be embedded in a network of international collaborations involved in frontier research, probing the invisible Universe through neutrino, cosmic-ray, gravitational-wave and dark matter detection. AstroCeNT and the field have a proven record of medical and commercial applications and after the uplift will bring further high-impact benefits to society and economy. The buildup of internationally-rooted research capacity, gained through strategic partnerships, will position the Centre to achieve a significant, measurable, improvement in research and innovation culture and long-term financial sustainability, in part through commercialisation. The Centre will improve mobility and gender balance, train new cadres of highly-qualified researchers in science and hi-tech industry, promote innovation and cooperation between scientists and industry and help Poland and the EU attain a competitive position in the global value chains.

Quantum Technologies for Axion Dark Matter Search,"The unresolved nature of the Dark Matter permeating our Universe is one of the most pressing questions of modern science. It is connected to our very understanding of reality at the most fundamental level. The axion DM paradigm has recently emerged as one of the most compelling hypothesis to solve this question: Dark Matter would be composed by very light and very feebly interacting axions. This
paradigm is strongly motivated by theory, and predicts a clear signal in terrestrial experiments called axion haloscopes.
Pioneering experiments have reached enough sensitivity to test some realistic axion models in limited mass ranges, so far without a positive signal. However, there is still a large viable axion parameter space to be explored. The methods used to date will be inefficient to perform such a challenging task. Here our DarkQuantum consortium proposes a new way of addressing this gap using quantum sensing
technologies and hybrid quantum systems.
Specifically, we will combine quantum technologies and well established particle physics environments at CERN or DESY devoted to the detection of axions in the galactic halo. Building quantum-enhanced setups in particle physics environments is extremely challenging and needs expertise from very different fields of physics. Our consortium brings together experts from quantum circuits, very-low temperature
cryogenics, quantum measurements and particle physics, to build two quantum-enhanced haloscopes with unprecedented sensitivity and mass scanning range. The novel sensing strategies of the DarkQuantum project could lead to the experimental detection of axions for the first time. Such a fundamental discovery in connection with the long-standing DM problem would lead to a breakthrough in Physics",14046028,2024,2030,ERC,Spain; Spain; Finland; Spain; Germany; Germany; France; Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Quantum Physics
Cutting Edge Leap to Excellence in Space and Optics TEchnologies,"CELESTE represents a visionary initiative by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) for positioning the Canary Islands as a hub of excellence for pioneering research and technology development centered on two interlinked domains—Advanced Optical Systems and New Space. CELESTE will elevate IACTEC (the IAC’s division dedicated to industry collaboration) into a self-sustaining Center of Excellence (CoE). This will be achieved in close collaboration with world-leading institutions, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), who will bring key knowhow in ground-breaking knowledge areas such as advanced astronomical instrument design, quantum communication technologies for secure space-to-Earth data transmission, and the development of ultra-high precision optical elements for astronomical observations. Also, strategic managerial knowhow.

A key driver of CELESTE is the Smart Specialization Strategy for the Canary Islands (2021-2027), which strongly supports the international leadership in Astrophysics and Space Sciences. A recent study by the region revealed the positive impact of the astrophysical activity to the Canary Islands' GDP, and for every million euros spent in the sector 45 jobs are generated. To scale this, CELESTE will allow to fully exploit ongoing investments that are already programmed for the next years.

CELESTE project will focus on creating the core structure for the long-term autonomy of IACTEC as self-sustained CoE (securing stable agreements with international partners and ensuring financial stability), foster productive training and exchange programs to attract and consolidate talent, setting up and operating a new battery of high-tech laboratories, and build a robust ecosystem of stakeholders.",12989887,2025,2030,European Commission,Spain; France; France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Relicts of Ancient Cellular Biochemistry in High-CO2 Subsurface Ecosystems,"The biological conversion of inorganic to organic carbon, autotrophic CO2 fixation, is arguably the most important biosynthetic process on Earth. Having been established early in the Archean Eon, a period characterized by an atmosphere rich in CO2, this metabolism helped spark and fuel the evolution of early microbial life. Mounting evidence suggests that exceedingly high levels of CO2 select for energetically efficient CO2 fixation pathways, immensely affecting carbon cycling. We hypothesize that CO2-rich subsurface ecosystems still harbor microbes that prefer or even require extremely high CO2 concentrations; we refer to these microbes as carbodioxyphiles. Accordingly, elevated CO2 levels would impact the thermodynamics of the microbial central carbon metabolism, enhancing autotrophy and hindering remineralization of organic matter by heterotrophs. To this end, we will study microbial life in CO2-rich subsurface environments and elucidate ancient metabolic pathways rendered obsolete by the CO2 levels of most modern environments. Each of the research team’s members has contributed to prior breakthroughs in novel autotrophic pathways, environmental genomics, metabolomics, and/or the biogeochemistry of deep subsurface environments. Establishing optimal synergy in this wealth of expertise and experience, we will describe novel modes of microbial carbon fixation in CO2-rich settings and elucidate the importance of carbodioxyphily for microbial evolution. Archean Park will provide a unique window through which to study a new mode of cellular biochemistry, the relicts of primordial carbon fixation, and Earth’s earliest carbon cycle. We will comprehensively characterize the metabolic mechanisms exploited by microbes to achieve evolutionary dominion in these relict environments. Our findings will stimulate biotechnological and geotechnical innovations ranging from enhanced autotrophic biomass production to improved carbon sequestration and storage.",12460648,2024,2030,ERC,Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany,EU,Biological Sciences; Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Medical Biochemistry and Metabolomics; Earth Sciences; Astronomical Sciences
European Photonic Quantum Computer,"Photonics is one of the first platforms explored for quantum computing (QC), bringing the advantage of low decoherence and natural connectivity for distributed and blind QC. Recent years have witnessed a step-change in the scale, complexity, and scope of QC with photons which recently led to 3 out of the 4 demonstrations of quantum advantage from Canadian and Chinese groups. These impressive achievements were obtained with squeezed light in bulky apparatus that are not fit for scalability. Europe shows strong leadership in development of integrated optical QC platforms, with breakthroughs in the development of high transmission dense photonic chips, record efficiency detectors and deterministic single photon sources. Photonic QC also benefits from a clear roadmap toward fault tolerant architectures proposed by leading EU quantum algorithm teams. EPIQUE gathers world leaders in photonics QC with expertise in both technology and algorithms from academia and SMEs who work together to deliver the technological breakthroughs required to push the platform toward general purpose QC. This will be achieved via new nanofabrication that combines novel switching with mature silicon compatible circuitry, via optimising both single photon sources and detectors, via new interfacing possibilities in silicon nitride and direct write modular chips, via fast low loss switching in lithium niobate, and via quantum architectures that leverage all of these advances. EPIQUE will develop three QC prototypes that will demonstrate essential building blocks of generating and fusing quantum states to entangle >10 qubits, and critical measurement and feedforward capabilities required to scale the platform to >1000 qubits. At the end of this project, we will have proven a route to general purpose quantum computing that will strengthen private investment in EU based optical QC companies.",11193760,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy; Poland; Austria; France; Belgium; Italy; Denmark; Germany; Netherlands; Italy; Czechia; Denmark; France; France; Portugal; Ireland; Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Spin based quantum computer and simulator (SPINUS),"The SPINUS project aims to establish experimental platforms for both quantum simulation (with >50 quantum units) and quantum computation (with >10 qubits). Despite rapid advancements, scaling and implementing quantum simulators and computers towards a regime surpassing available classical methods remains difficult due to the demanding constraints of existing architectures. By utilizing the exceptional qualities of silicon carbide (SiC) and diamond materials, the SPINUS project suggests a novel strategy for scalable solid-state quantum simulation and computation hardware based on nuclear spin networks and dipole-dipole entangled electron spin qubits. 

Our first goal is to create a quantum simulation platform that uses optically polarized NV centers and color centers along with nuclear spin networks in diamond or SiC. This technology allows for the investigation of a wide range of strongly correlated models without being constrained by the capabilities of the available quantum simulators. 

Second, we aim at scaling up platforms for solid-state quantum computing to more than 10 fully programmable qubits at ambient temperatures. For these purposes, the consortium will investigate various architectures and techniques for initializing, controlling, and reading out the spin qubits with the goal of achieving large-scale quantum simulation and computation capabilities. This will take advantage of the excellent coherence properties and robustness against environmental noise of these materials.

SPINUS has great potential to advance the field of quantum computing and simulation and open new possibilities for the investigation of intricate quantum systems by fostering and contributing to a European quantum and a European diamond ecosystem by working closely with start-up businesses affiliated with the project team and cooperation with the related Flagship initiatives.",11005012,2024,2027,European Commission,Germany; Belgium; Sweden; Germany; Germany; Italy; Hungary; Denmark; Germany; Netherlands; Czechia,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Positive Geometry in Particle Physics and Cosmology,"There are strong indications from physics at both infinitesimal and cosmic distances that our current understanding of the laws of nature is only approximate, and must be replaced by deeper principles. The UNIVERSE+ project seeks a new foundation for fundamental physics, ranging from elementary particles to the Big Bang, revealing a hidden world of ideas beyond quantum mechanics and spacetime. Novel geometric objects recently discovered in theoretical physics hint at new mathematical structures. Combinatorics, algebra and geometry have been connected to particle physics and cosmology in an entirely unexpected way. Leveraging these advances, we will launch the field of Positive Geometry, as a new mathematical framework for describing the laws of physics. To this end, we bring together the necessary expertise in particle physics (Arkani-Hamed, Henn), cosmology (Baumann) and mathematics (Sturmfels). This is the first collaboration of its kind, made possible by a recent confluence of critical insights in both mathematics and physics, which are now so closely aligned as to propel us forward on a clear trajectory. Our goals are fiercely ambitious: we aim to create a new mathematical language for describing physical phenomena at all scales, from the interactions of elementary particles to the large-scale structure of the universe.",10824895,2024,2030,ERC,Germany; United States; Netherlands,EU,Philosophy and Religious Studies; History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields; Particle and High Energy Physics
Plasma Accelerator systems for Compact Research Infrastructures,"""Plasma accelerators driven by advanced laser sources and/or compact electron linacs are key components for the next generation of green and sustainable research infrastructures. We propose a project on the development of """"Plasma Accelerator systems for Compact Research Infrastructures"""" (PACRI), which will develop highly important and ground-breaking plasma accelerator technologies for Europe's future research infrastructures (RI). 
The specific objectives of PACRI are: 
- The development of high repetition rate plasma modules, as required for the EuPRAXIA ESFRI project, capable of extending its scientific scope from high average brightness radiation sources to high energy physics.
- Improving the performance of normal conducting accelerator technology for X-band linacs, paving the way for high repetition rate operation (up to kHz) with a focus on efficiency and power consumption.
- The development of key laser components required to scale up high power, high repetition rate laser technology as required by the EuPRAXIA and ELI ESFRI research infrastructures.
The achievement of the PACRI objectives will enable the production of unique particle and photon beams with a wide range of applications in ultrafast science, high precision medical imaging, materials diagnostics, medical treatment and, in the longer term, the development of future compact colliders.  These developments will be used for future resource-efficient upgrades of existing RIs at INFN, Elettra, CERN, CNR, CNRS, DESY, ELI, GSI/FAIR and UKRI.
In addition, PACRI will support the implementation of ESFRI's EuPRAXIA distributed research facility by consolidating its sites and centres of excellence being developed under the ongoing EuPRAXIA_PP project. It will fund the development of some technical prototypes that are crucial for the implementation of the EuPRAXIA project and other European Research Infrastructures (e.g. enabling major upgrades to the ELI-Beamlines facility).

The role of silica in the dawn of life on our planet,"All information humankind has of the ancient past of our planet comes from analyzing the geological record encoded in rocks. There is, however, no rock record of the first 600 million years of Earth’s history. Unlocking the secrets of this earliest period –the Hadean– is a fundamental task for science, as it is key to understanding how the planet became habitable, when the first forms of metabolism and self-replication developed, and life appeared. The lack of a geological record has led scientists to use computational modeling to make inferences about the conditions in Early Earth’s environments. Less common are laboratory experiments specifically targeted to simulating Hadean conditions. Based on ubiquitous carbonaceous chert deposits in the oldest rock record, it is widely accepted that many early Archean aquatic settings were reducing and rich in silica and some basic carbon-based molecules. We reason that such aquatic conditions were already established during the early Hadean, and inevitably led to the existence of a large-scale factory of simple and complex organic compounds, many of them relevant to prebiotic chemistry and to the route to biomimetic hybrid microstructures able to self-organize and catalyze prebiotic reactions relevant to the origin of life. Our project is aimed at understanding the crucial role of silica in directing the geochemical and protobiological processes, creating habitats for early life, and preserving early biomass on Earth’s surface during the first billion years of its history. PROTOS will use an array of laboratory experiments (the Hadean Simulator) to systematically study ab-initio reactions of water and gases with the earliest rock types in order to determine compositions of aquatic habitats and subsequent silica precipitation mechanisms, organic synthesis processes on silica/iron surfaces, and the preservation of the first remnants of life. PROTOS will change our view of the infancy of the planet.",10820569,2024,2030,ERC,Spain; Netherlands; Spain; Germany; France; France; Germany,EU,Earth Sciences; Geochemistry; Geology; Astronomical Sciences
Studies of Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics,"This award supports experimental nuclear physics research at Florida State University (FSU). FSU researchers perform experiments at the on-campus John D. Fox Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory and at national laboratories in the US and around the world. This research pursues two overarching goals. The first goal is to measure nuclear reactions that take place in stellar explosions. These reactions are responsible for producing most of the naturally occurring elements in the universe. The second goal is to measure and understand the behavior of exotic nuclei – isotopes that have too many neutrons or too few neutrons to be stable. All of this research is performed in close collaboration with theoretical physicists at both FSU and elsewhere. The Fox Laboratory’s research program is one of the nation’s most important training grounds for nuclear scientists at both the Ph.D. and undergraduate levels. A collaboration between the FSU laboratory and the Mayo clinic in Jacksonville is investigating the parameters of cancer therapy in preparation for the first carbon ion therapy facility in North America. The scientists supported by this award will conduct laboratory experiments to determine the rates at which reactions occur in exploding stars, and thereby understand the abundances of elements in the universe. These experiments will also lead to a better interpretation of the energy release and nucleosynthesis outcomes by calibrating the relevant nuclear reactions. The experiments with exotic nuclei will provide rigorous tests of our understanding of the behavior of all nuclei. More specifically, these measurements will provide an understanding of shell evolution from stable to neutron-rich nuclei. Further, the development of a triton beam will give the lab unique capabilities to study (t,p) reactions such as 49T(t,p) to distinguish between the f5/2 and f7/2 neutron states in 51Ti.

Online Data Intensive Solutions for Science in the Exabytes Era,"This project federates efforts from 3 pan-European ESFRI infrastructures (HL-LHC, SKAO and SLICES-RI) in physical sciences, Big Data, and in the computing continuum supporting flagship instruments that will maintain and strengthen European leadership in high-energy physics and astronomy. The main goal is to enable key science projects, with the search for Dark Matter serving as a pilot program, combining the complementary capabilities of these three unique research infrastructures. ODISSEE will deliver evolutionary and revolutionary hardware and software platforms to address the corresponding digital challenges in a highly competitive international context. Developed through a joint and comprehensive R&D program with industry partners, as well as access to cutting edge experimental facilities from SLICES-RI, so as to enable HL-LHC and SKA to process and analyze the vast volumes of raw data they produce. Targeting such dataflow driven applications opens the way to a new range of technologies and services, feeding SLICES-RI with a unique yet representative set of specifications to progress their operational & experimental capacities at an unprecedented scale, increasing the dissemination potential. Bringing these 3 infrastructures to their full capacity, as well as operating and maintaining them, pose similar grand challenges across the digital continuum and require addressing the 3 dimensions of sustainability. Co-design and close partnership of academia with European companies will foster competitiveness of European industry and promote digital sovereignty. The project is deeply embedded into both regional and international R&I ecosystems, with strong connections to several major European initiatives and associated partnerships with main technology providers.

4D scanning transmission electron microscopy for structural biology,"Electron Microscopy (EM) has transformed research in the Life and Physical Sciences separately. Cryo-EM in Life Sciences allows the 3D structure determination of proteins down to 1.0 Å resolution in case they are large enough and present in high numbers in homogeneous states. For many molecules involved in diseases like neurodegeneration, however, structure determination is still severely hampered due to their insufficient contrast when imaged in vitreous ice or in their native cellular environment. To date, EM in the Physical Sciences generated utmost contrast for light atoms and established a resolution in the range of 0.2 Å limited only by thermal motion. This record was achieved by evolving scanning transmission EM (STEM) from a 2D to a 4D imaging technique combining imaging with diffraction. In this project, we will work out 4D-BioSTEM methodologies and develop a cryo-EM tool that maximizes contrast and resolution by bringing together EM groups from Life and Physical Sciences. 4D-STEM imaging of frozen biological specimens will be approached with unique and specialized hardware, theory and simulation, the development of microscope operation routines, and image reconstruction algorithms. In particular, we will acquire sparse 4D data using ultrafast detectors, employ methods for direct phasing (differential phase contrast, DPC) and establish advanced, so-called ptychographic, techniques to gain maximal signal from noisy 4D cryo-STEM data that are limited in their electron dose budget. We will make use of synergies between recently separated fields in order to make proteins smaller than 50 kDa amenable to structure elucidation. Furthermore, we will expand 4D-STEM to tomography, to obtain high-contrast 3D reconstructions from cellular samples, human brain tissue of neurodegenerative diseases, and vitrified organic energy materials. A new comprehensive structural imaging framework will be put forward and benchmarked as to its utility in Life and Physical Science applications of cryo-EM.",8107200,2024,2029,ERC,Germany; Germany; Switzerland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Cryogenic storage and refuelling in space,"To move away from the dependence on hydrazine for space propulsion, greener alternatives must be sought. Cryogenic propellant combinations such as oxygen / methane offer higher specific impulses than storable combinations, but their low saturation temperatures raise additional challenges with respect to preventing their evaporation during long-term storage. While the ability to refuel craft with cryogenic propellants would allow for longer-term manned missions to Mars and the Moon, as well as aid in the improvement of in-space sustainability, preventing the evaporation of the propellants during the transfer process also poses challenges. As of today, neither long-term storage nor refuelling with cryogenic propellants has been demonstrated in-orbit. 

CRYSALIS will develop and mature the technologies needed for the management of cryogenic propellant for future space transportation and in-orbit servicing activities. This maturation will include performing a small-scale in-orbit demonstration to mature those whose performance can only be characterised in a microgravity environment. This will be a closed-system demonstrator flown on-board the Nyx capsule, which will aim to not only demonstrate the feasibility of such processes but will aim to improve the understanding of the behaviour of such propellants under microgravity, allowing for development of future systems. 

These technologies will aid in ensuring the independent access of the EU to space, in particular to manned and heavy missions beyond GEO and LEO, by supporting the development of a logistical network of craft, depots, and hubs, required for cis-lunar and future Martian missions.",8043974,2024,2028,European Commission,Belgium; Spain,EU,Space Sciences
REVEALing Signatures of Habitable Worlds Hidden by Stellar Activity,"For millennia people have wondered, “Do other Earths exist?” “Are they common?” “Would they show signs of life?”.

New radial-velocity spectrometers are capable of detecting the reflex motions of stars hosting Earth-mass planets in their habitable zones; the James Webb Space Telescope has the power to probe the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets. Yet the unprecedented precision of these instruments’ measurement capabilities is up against a fundamental astrophysically-imposed barrier to achieving these goals: contamination of exoplanetary signals by stellar activity and variability. Further progress is contingent on solving this “variability problem”.

REVEAL gathers world-leading experts in exoplanetary and stellar physics to tackle this problem in synergy:

- We will build on recent advances in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of stellar atmospheres, and data-driven efforts to separate the exoplanet signal from the stellar variability.

- We will simulate the “ground truth” of the turbulent physics of entire stellar photospheres resolved at the level of individual convective cells for a broad class of stars.

- We will model the emergent spectra of these “virtual” stars and “observe” them using the same data-processing pipelines as stellar radial-velocity and transit-spectroscopy observations.

We will continue to observe the Sun and stars hosting small planets found with TESS and PLATO. The stars’ own spectra will REVEAL the clues needed to disentangle stellar variability from our measurements of their planets’ masses and the fingerprints of molecules in their atmospheres. Our unified efforts will enable the new cutting-edge space observatories and ground-based facilities to realize the full potential of their designs, bringing us closer to the most profound discoveries we could hope to achieve in our lifetimes - the identification of another Earth or even possible signs of life on another planet.",7394973,2024,2030,ERC,Austria; United Kingdom; United States; United States; Germany,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Support for the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope Facility,"Many stars in our galaxy host one or more planets. With this award, the WIYN telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson will continue to be used primarily to measure the velocities and masses of these “exoplanets”. Masses are needed to determine if an exoplanet is primarily gaseous, icy, or rocky. Research enabled by this program will strengthen the foundations for identifying and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets in the nearby cosmos. The primary instrument being used at WIYN, known as NEID, exceeds its technical requirements and routinely measures planet velocities to better than a meter per second. This proposal will fund the next 45 months of NSF’s contribution to WIYN operations, in support of the NASA-NSF Exoplanet Observational Research (NN-EXPLORE) Program. NN-EXPLORE brings together federal agencies, federal research centers, and U.S. universities, with the goal of advancing research in exoplanets. The open access for enquiry-based research via peer review and open data facilitated by this award will allow scientists and citizens to engage in the WIYN research enterprise no matter who they are or where they work. Many participants are early career scientists and undergraduate students. Under this award, NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab) will continue to operate the WIYN telescope from 2024 through 2027 as NSF’s contribution to the NN-EXPLORE program. NN-EXPLORE enables scientific research related to the characterization of exoplanets and their host stars. NEID is the only open-access extreme-precision radial velocity instrument in the U.S. that has the technical capability and the required years-long and high cadence (approximately every other night) time on sky to meet the goal of identifying nearby habitable planets, following up on discoveries by NASA missions like Kepler and TESS, picking key targets for the James Webb and Roman Space Telescopes, and blazing the path forward to enable NASA’s future Habitable Worlds Observatory. This award provides support for essential operations and maintenance of WIYN, as well as minor technological upgrades needed for the continued operation of NEID. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",6682584,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
Quantum Glass-based Photonic Integrated Circuits,"QLASS brings together experts from top research groups, up-and-coming SMEs, and industry to achieve the ambitious goal of producing a quantum photonic integrated circuit (QPIC) utilizing the extremely versatile technique of femtosecond laser writing (FLW) to fabricate 3D waveguides within glass developed for optimum photonic performance to support an unprecedented 200 reconfigurable optical modes. Compared to other QPIC techniques, glass yields extremely small interface losses (<5%) – ideal for modular, scalable architectures connecting multiple chips – with speed, affordability, and optimization for end-user goals. Incorporating high-performance single-photon sources, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, and electronics enabling reconfigurable state manipulation via control of an exceptionally large number of cryogenic-detector channels (200) and phase shifters (1000), we will create an end-to-end quantum photonics platform. We will implement Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), leading candidates for near-term advantage, for which our platform is ideally suited. We will develop software for end users to translate their VQAs into FLW circuits, with error mitigation to enhance QPIC performance. Our principal use case is solving problems in the design of lithium-ion batteries to achieve improvements in capacity and efficiency crucial for attaining EU technological and sustainability goals. QLASS will attain substantial advancement both towards the specific QPIC objectives as well as glass development, with associated novel SNSPD processes, benefitting the wider community and enabling new quantum devices with performance far exceeding other platforms.

Quantum Universal Photonics Integrated Circuit platform,"Quantum technology holds the promise of enabling next generation computing, communications and sensing systems. However, the size, cost and scalability of current devices prevents them from reaching their full potential. Photonics is one of the key enabling technologies for quantum technology. In particular, photonics integrated circuits (PICs) with their wafer-level manufacturing based on microfabrication technologies can provide the reduction in size and cost and enable next generation scalable quantum technologies. To fully achieve this goal, an universal PIC technology that can serve most quantum applications is needed.

In QU-PIC, we selected the Al2O3 integrated photonics platform as backbone technology for the development of quantum PICs thanks to its excellent low propagation loss performance and wide operating spectral region from the ultraviolet (200 nm) until the mid-infrared. A large range of PIC building blocks is developed in QU-PIC, focusing on areas where materials or integration technologies are not yet available. Several light sources, including multiwavelength tunable lasers with operation at 399 nm, 411 nm and 935 nm on the PIC, UVC external cavity lasers emitting at 280 nm, sources of squeezed photons, single photon detectors, programmable ASICs and the required packaging and assembly technologies will be investigated. An open PDK will group all the developed quantum building blocks to accelerate innovation from the initial idea to an actually manufactured system. Two application demonstrators will be implemented using the developed building blocks, namely a source of GKP states for quantum processing and an atomic clock based on Yb+ ions for quantum sensing. It is the ambition of QU-PIC to secure a full European supply chain to establish Europe’s Sovereignty and manufacturing capabilities in photonics integrated circuits for quantum.",6438502,2024,2027,European Commission,Netherlands; Germany; Germany; Belgium; Spain; Germany; Germany; Sweden,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Technological Research Action Necessary for Safe PARrtitioning And Nuclear Transmutation,"The impact of low carbon energy sources in combating rapid climate change underlines the role of nuclear energy as part of a sustainable energy mix. Yet, safety and waste concerns must not be downplayed. For the latter, the main goal should be to recycle used fuel, aiming to close the fuel cycle. This eases ultimate radioactive waste management, enhances proliferation resistance and drastically improves economy and sustainability by better use of fuel resources.
The SNETP deployment plan outlines technical needs for fuel recycling including separation of used fuel, fabrication and characterisation of minor actinide bearing fuel and the development of transmutation systems to recover energy and reduce waste.
This proposal aligns with the SNETP deployment plan and responds to the call in HORIZON-EURATOM-2023-NRT-01, topic 05 “Partitioning and transmutation of minor actinides towards industrial application”. It focuses on the efficiency of Am (Americium) separation from used fuel, on experimental and fuel performance code development work studying the behaviour of Am bearing fuel under irradiation and on the safety related research supporting the licensing process of MYRRHA in its role as dedicated accelerator driven transmuter demonstrator. This project builds upon the collaborative efforts initiated in the PATRICIA project, bringing together communities working on partitioning, transmutation, and MYRRHA development.
Finally, dedicated work packages deal with education, focusing on pre-and post-graduates, and with dissemination, targeting the specific stakeholders and the public at large. A further task on knowledge management encompasses both foreground data as well as metadata as to ensure that proper quality assessment and validation is possible. The project will employ a combination of experiments, theoretical studies and numerical simulations harnessing the expertise of 21 research centres and universities from eight EU countries, the UK and Switzerland.

Advanced Circuits for Detection and Control of Diamond Quantum Sensors,"Quantum sensors using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin colour centres in diamond have made great strides from scientific curiosity towards practical applications. First devices, for example Diamond Scanning Probe microscopes, are on the market. However, large scale applications are limited by the availability of a compact hardware combined with the diamond quantum chip and their cost-effectiveness. ACDC_Q, tackles these challenges by creating a fully integrated system for control and readout of NV centres by making use of semiconductor technology. The project builds upon a first demonstration of this integration (OEAW, Infineon). The device makes use of electrical readout of NV centres, as pioneered by IMEC and developed by the applicants in previous  EU projects. Further development of the integrated logic in ACDC_Q will allow controlled excitation and spin manipulation devices. The integration will lead to compact and cost-effective realization, while reaching state-of-the-art performance, comparable to devices constructed on an optical table. The devices will be developed towards commercial applications in magnetometry, including non-destructive evaluation (Kwant-Tek), space magnetometry (IMEC, ASI), and remote monitoring (Thales). The device performance will be calibrated in the precise EU metrology facilities (PTB). By bringing together pioneering academic research with cutting-edge semiconductor industrial processes and leading manufacturers, ACDC_Q will transform diamond sensors from laboratory experiments to prototypes developed to target commercialization.",5412301,2025,2028,European Commission,Belgium; Austria; Italy; Germany; France; Austria,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
PROtotypes of Magnetic Imaging Systems for Europe,"PROMISE is a consortium that focuses on the application of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) in diamond quantum technology for imaging. The aim is to guide the development and use of this mature and promising quantum technology, which is known for its ease of operation.

PROMISE leads the NV based quantum imaging sensors to the next level of development building widefield magnetometer prototypes to measure relevant samples into operational environments (TRL7) to foster its market uptake. The PROMISE widefield NV magnetometer excels in imaging compared to other technologies by generating magnetic field maps without scanning. This results in a faster acquisition time (orders of magnitude faster than scanning protocols), a wide field of view and increased sensitivity. This speed up in the acquisition is the key to open up its use in a wide range of new applications.

The consortium is committed to leveraging the developed NV-based prototypes for a consolidated market uptake by involving relevant partners along the whole value-chain. A unified, compact, affordable and low-consumption benchtop prototype will be designed and developed without impacting performance and functionalities. Machine learning software is being developed to streamline both data acquisition and data analysis, to facilitate for non-quantum expert use of the device and paving the way to automate inspection process. PROMISE also includes expertise that will contribute to standardising designs and methods required for the industry.

During the project, four use cases will validate the prototypes, impacting the semiconductor industry, material science, aerospace and biotechnology. The industry, in general, will benefit from a tool that will enable improvements in their devices, materials and production processes, as well as provide a deeper understanding of mechanisms at the atomic level. It will also monitor events and dynamics to enable more accurate predictions and address pressing challenges in various domains.",5189729,2025,2028,European Commission,Spain; Netherlands; Germany; Italy; Czechia; Italy; Spain; Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Innovate for Sustainable Accelerating Systems,"Particle accelerators have become essential instruments to improve our health, the environment, our safety, and our high-tech abilities, as well as to unlock new fundamental insights in physics, chemistry, biology, and generally enable scientific breakthroughs that improve our lives. Accelerating particles to higher energies will always require a large amount of energy. In a society where energy sustainability is critical, keeping energy consumption as low as reasonable possible is an unavoidable challenge for both research infrastructures (RIs) and industry, which collectively operate over 40,000 accelerators. Based on state-of-the-art technology, the portfolio of current and future accelerator-driven RIs in Europe could develop to consume up to 1% of Germany's annual electricity demand. With the ambition to maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of European RIs and to enable Europe’s Green Deal, we propose to Innovate for Sustainable Accelerating Systems (iSAS) by establishing enhanced collaboration in the field to broaden, expedite and amplify the development and impact of novel energy-saving technologies to accelerate particles. For many frontier accelerators superconducting RF (SRF) systems are the enabling technology. iSAS will innovate those technologies that have been identified as being a common core of SRF accelerating systems and that have the largest leverage for energy savings to minimize the intrinsic energy consumption in all phases of operation. In the landscape of accelerator-driven RIs, solutions are being developed to reuse the waste heat produced, to develop energy-efficient magnets and to operate facilities on opportunistic schedules when energy is available. The iSAS project has a complementary focus on the energy efficiency of the SRF accelerating technologies. This will contribute to the vital transition to sustain the tremendous 20th century applications of the accelerator technology in a green and energy conscious 21st century.",5044419,2024,2028,European Commission,France; France; Belgium; Switzerland; United States; United Kingdom; Germany; Switzerland; United Kingdom; Sweden; Germany; Italy,EU,Quantum Physics
"ExpandQISE: Track 2: Quantum Materials Institute: 2D Materials, heterostructures and metasurfaces for compact, efficient entangled photon-pair generation for quantum communications","This Expanding Capacity in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (ExpandQISE) project establishes a Quantum Materials Institute at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, in collaboration with Montana State University and the NSF funded Q-AMASE-i MonArk Quantum Foundry. The Quantum Materials Institute comprises an interdisciplinary team focused on the discovery and development of compact, efficient nonlinear optical systems based on combining atomically-thin two dimensional materials and sub-wavelength flat optics, also known as meta-surfaces. Such compact and efficient nonlinear optical materials are expected to find application in chip-scale integrated photonics and quantum networks. The project explores the design, physical limits and mechanisms for achieving extraordinarily high optical nonlinearities in atomically-thin materials. By coordinating the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical analyses of a palette of two-dimensional materials and meta-surfaces, the Institute will pursue a fundamental understanding of materials and systems optimized for second harmonic generation and parametric downconversion, two important nonlinear optical processes in quantum communication networks based on entangled photons. The project will also support training and workforce development in quantum information science by developing and delivering coursework in quantum communications and quantum computing, through a certificate in quantum communications, a minor in quantum information science and collaboration with quantum communications and quantum computing industry partners. The Quantum Materials Institute will focus on the discovery of novel 2D materials, heterostructures and meta-surfaces to achieve compact systems with efficient second order processes, including second harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). In partnership with the MonArk Quantum Foundry, heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides with varying monolayer composition, spacing, and orientation (""twist"") will be examined using spatially- and spectrally-resolved multi-photon excitation microscopy. In concert, self-assembled plasmonic meta-surfaces and their chiral assembly will be developed. Chemical vapor deposition will be used to grow novel 2D materials, as well as other methods. The institute will explore the light-matter interaction and enhanced second harmonic generation in 2D materials and heterostructures supported by metasurfaces. Density functional theory will predict the band structure, along with associated optical properties, and finite difference time domain method will be used to describe the optical interactions with the meta-surfaces. A large palette of 2D material candidates is planned, from MXene's to transition metal dichalcogenide's to perovskites and Janus materials. Compact, efficient second order nonlinear materials are essential for the integration of quantum communications and integrated photonic circuits. The Quantum Materials Institute will foster educational program(s) in quantum information science, including a certificate in quantum communications and a minor in quantum information science. The minor is designed to allow a broader pool of students to become trained in quantum information science. Results from the project will be shared with underrepresented groups, particularly Native American populations in South Dakota and first-generation college students.

ExpandQISE: Track 2: Quantum Fluids and Solids as Platforms for Quantum Science and Engineering,"This project aims to elevate Florida A&M University (FAMU), a leading Historically Black College and University, to the forefront of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE). The project is structured around three strategic goals. Firstly, the project collaborates with leading external experts to develop cutting-edge QISE research, featuring four synergistic activities leveraging quantum fluids and solids: advancing an emerging qubit platform with electrons confined on a solid neon surface; building optomechanical sensors using photons trapped in levitated superfluid helium drops; studying the evolution of electron superposition states in superfluid helium; and developing rotation sensors utilizing the matter-wave nature of superfluid helium. Secondly, it aims to create a comprehensive educational program at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering (COE) designed to address the national demand for engineers proficient in quantum concepts and techniques. Lastly, the project also focuses on ensuring the sustainability of QISE research and education through strategic infrastructure development and faculty recruitment at FAMU-FSU COE. This multifaceted approach is poised to drive regional and national advancements in quantum research and education, ultimately contributing to the broader goal of establishing a competitive and diverse quantum workforce in the United States. The research team leverages quantum fluids and solids to advance Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) through four synergistic projects, each poised to drive significant advances in quantum technology and theory. The first project advances an emerging qubit platform by using electrons trapped on solid neon surfaces, focusing on a detailed comprehension and manipulation of these electron quantum states. It explores the stability and coherence properties of trapped electrons, making significant strides in developing robust qubit systems. The second project develops ultrahigh-finesse optical cavities with levitated superfluid helium drops, entering novel realms of quantum optomechanics to sense quantum fluctuations with unprecedented sensitivity. This activity probes the interactions between light and matter at the quantum level, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of quantum systems. The third project investigates the wavefunction dynamics of electrons in superposition states within superfluid helium, enhancing understanding of quantum decoherence processes critical for maintaining the integrity of quantum information. The research explores the mechanisms of decoherence in a superfluid environment. The final project focuses on the engineering optimization of superfluid quantum interference devices, aiming to significantly enhance their performance in quantum sensing applications. This involves refining the design and fabrication techniques to improve the sensitivity and reliability of these devices.

"ExpandQISE: Track 2: Integrating research and education pathways to the quantum future: synthesis, control and readout of spin-phonon quantum states for QISE education.","Emerging quantum technologies are poised to enable powerful new forms of computation, communications, and sensing. However, the development and deployment of these technologies will require the mastery of complex physical systems and the birth of a robust quantum smart workforce. To meet these needs, this project at Northern Arizona University cultivates and explores new approaches, systems, and training programs for quantum information science. The central research goals of this project aim to prepare, control, and measure quantum states that involve electronic, mechanical, microwave, and optical degrees of freedom, enabling new “spin-optomechanical” systems. Scientific milestones span from the development of new bulk-sapphire mechanical resonators with ultralow losses to the development of optical detection techniques for quantum states that reside in the mechanical domain. Such systems and methods may provide solutions to pressing challenges such as the relatively short lifetime and distribution of quantum information. The project’s education and workforce development efforts are organized according to a multi-tiered plan, providing training opportunities spanning from the Ph.D.-level researcher to K12 community engagement. Deliberate interconnections between the tiers are designed to increase recruitment and retention by allowing multiple entry points, supporting different career destinations, providing opportunities to build STEM identity, and enhancing a sense of belonging. The practical application of quantum technology promises paradigm shifting advances in computation, simulation, sensing, and communications. However, major challenges, including decoherence and transduction of quantum states into telecommunications wavebands, must be addressed before these technologies can be widely utilized. To explore new approaches to these challenges, this research investigates the synthesis, control and measurement of spin-phonon quantum states in sapphire. Ground state transitions of chromium ions and mechanical modes of vibration in sapphire can have lifetimes surpassing seconds and, using mechanical confinement and magnetic fields, can be brought into resonance. Combining these properties with pulsed microwave excitation and optical cavities, such systems may facilitate the transduction of quantum information between chromium ions, mechanical degrees of freedom and optical fields, permitting the synthesis and optical readout of exotic quantum states. Partnering with external collaborators at Yale, University of California Santa Barbara, and Sandia National Lab, the project team will create such “spin optomechanical” systems and synthesize and measure spin-phonon quantum states using microwaves and light. The project will achieve these goals by combining bulk-crystalline optomechanical devices that can be accessed with microwaves, new forms of cryogenically compatible optical coupling, and precision implantation of single chromium ions. The experimental plan systematically builds new capabilities in quantum physics, beginning with spin-phonon spectroscopy and ending with quantum tomography measurements.

AN ELECTRON BEAMLINE AT THE European-XFEL,"One of the highlights of the European research infrastructure landscape is the world's most powerful X-ray-laser, the European XFEL. The ELBEX (Extracted Lepton Beam at the European XFEL) proposal builds on this strength and will set up new opportunities for European scientists and innovators, by providing an extracted high energy electron beam for experiments. With ELBEX we propose a pathfinder project to demonstrate the feasibility of such a facility at the European XFEL. This unique new possibility would strengthen the global competitiveness of the European Research Area and create opportunities for new user groups.

The high energy, high charge density and excellent quality of the electron beam, if brought into interaction with a strong laser beam, opens up the study of a range of scientific topics, most prominently, of strong field Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  For the first time, the Schwinger limit for the electromagnetic field strength, at which non-perturbative QED effects become relevant, could be reached experimentally  in this facility. Studying the particles created in the photon beam dump opens up the possibility to search for feebly interacting particles, complementing current or planned experiments like FASER II or SHiP. In addition, the electron beam itself is at the centre of a range of highly relevant and ambitious experiments in the area of accelerator science and detector science. 

Within the ELBEX project, the installation of a facility to extract an electron beam from the European XFEL using a fast kicker magnet and to transport it into a multi-purpose experimental area will be prepared. On the condition that a positive decision by the European XFEL council is reached to grant an extended 12-week XFEL shutdown, the installation of the ELBEX facility is an option.",4597748,2025,2029,European Commission,Germany; United Kingdom; Spain; Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Experiments for Validation and Enhancement of the REactor preSsure vessel fluence assessmenT,"""The safety of a nuclear reactor relies heavily on modelling. In the last two decades, making use of the increased computer power available, advanced multi-physics solvers have been developed to reduce the level of conservatism when simulating pressurized water reactors. These tools rely on a first-principles based approach and produce solutions with a much finer spatial resolution. However they are seldom used in practice due to, amongst other things, the lack of dedicated experimental data for validation, especially when it comes to their improved spatial resolution.
The EVEREST project intends to address this issue by quantifying the impact of using advanced MP models for the modelling of a VVER reactor (""""usefulness""""); by demonstrating the accuracy of their results, especially the improved resolution through the production of dedicated experimental data (“trustworthiness”); and by promoting them to key groups of the nuclear engineering community (students, utilities, regulators). The consortium is built around the necessary research facilities and expertise from all the required actors of the nuclear industry, both within Europe and outside.
In terms of impact, the project will produce scientific knowledge towards producing electricity using a climate-neutral energy system, in a safe and efficient way. The advanced models will provide more accurate and detailed information about the current safety margins in nuclear reactors enabling more informed decisions on setting the regulatory limits; and resulting in an improvement of the plant safety as a whole. A better understanding of the safety margins for a nuclear power plant could also allow power uprate. The same approach can be envisioned for research reactors and allow more users to carry out research activities. Finally, the EVEREST project will have a long-term impact on knowledge preservation through the organization of a summer school and trainings as well as the funding of mobility grants.""",4419417,2024,2028,European Commission,Germany; France; Germany; Slovenia; Finland; Hungary; United States; Hungary; Switzerland; Switzerland; Spain,EU,Engineering; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Consolidating plans for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope,"The landscape of future ground-based European astronomical research infrastructures expected to start in the 2030s is broad and diverse, ranging from low-frequency radio (SKAO), to the optical (ELT, EST), all the way to cosmic rays (CTAO) and gravitational waves (Einstein Telescope). There are two glaring omissions, however. The first is a sensitive, high resolution next-generation facility operating at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths (0.35-10 mm), a crucial observing window for the study of a broad range of astrophysical objects, from our Solar System to the Milky Way, nearby galaxies, and the distant universe. The second is that currently planned facilities are not truly prepared to operate in a low carbon emissions future, meeting the needs of the research community and the aspirations of the EU for carbon-neutrality. This project, consolidating the plans for the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), directly addresses both needs, providing solutions that will inform other observatories along the way, especially our partners ESFRI landmark (ESO-ELT) and project (EST). Our ambition is to harness European knowhow and cooperate on a global scale to revolutionise our understanding of the (sub-)mm universe, while pushing observational astronomy towards a greener future. Strengthened by a H2020-funded design study and an engaged community of about 200 researchers worldwide, we have produced science cases, telescope conceptual designs, and plans for a sustainable, off-grid power system. We are now ready to consolidate the AtLAST concept, prototype and test our technology solutions, perform a full lifecycle assessment of the facility, and to expand our user community. By the end of this project, AtLAST will have increased the technology readiness level of its crucial components and undergone preliminary design review, ready to move the project to its implementation phase.",4336118,2025,2028,European Commission,Norway; Germany; Spain; Japan; Spain; Japan; Italy; Germany; United Kingdom; South Africa; Germany; Spain; Netherlands; United Kingdom; Sweden,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Addressing PRiorities of Evaluated Nuclear Data in Europe,"The conception, development, optimization, and safety evaluation of a broad range of nuclear energy (fission and fusion) and non-energy applications (radiation protection, radionuclide production, health, geosciences, space research, security, and industry) require reliable and accurate simulation tools. Such tools critically rely on accurate nuclear decay and reaction data. APRENDE has the ambition to improve nuclear data for modelling and simulation (M&S) tools used by European stakeholders in the application areas of the European Union and its member states that currently have the highest priority. The priority application areas identified by stakeholders of nuclear data and by national, European, and international projects and consultations are:

A. All aspects of spent nuclear fuel (SNF),
B. Reactor operational characteristics such as reactivity versus burnup, transients, and margins,
C. Advanced reactor and fuel cycle development including small modular reactors (SMR) and GenIV systems based on lead and sodium coolants, molten salts, or an accelerator like MYRRHA,
D. Criticality safety and shielding for safety assessments and safety assessment methodologies,
E. Non-Energy applications, radiation protection.

This ambition requires a comprehensive approach involving the eight objectives stated above, and a methodology and impact pathway as detailed below. The combination of this ambition, objectives, methodology and our pathway to create impact is what the proposers believe to be not only the best, but also an excellent response to the HORIZON-EURATOM-2023-NRT-01-06 call ‘Improved nuclear data for the safety of energy and non-energy applications of ionising radiation’.

Electromagnetic waves exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviour, with the quantized nature of light becoming apparent in the realm of quantum technologies. The QU-ATTO network aims to merge the fields of quantum optics and quantum information science with attosecond physics. This involves focusing on experimental campaigns to highlight quantum aspects in the interaction of intense laser fields with matter and advancing theoretical descriptions for a comprehensive understanding of the quantum state of light associated with intense laser fields. 
Traditionally, attosecond pulses have been generated using table-top femtosecond lasers. However, recent experiments performed at free-electron lasers (FELs) have demonstrated the production of isolated attosecond pulses and precise control of attosecond waveforms for pulse trains, leading to remarkable advancements in attosecond science. The network also aims to leverage recent advances in seeded FELs and high-intensity high-harmonic generation (HHG)-based attosecond sources to demonstrate the coherent control of electronic dynamics in systems of increasing complexity. 
The QU-ATTO network represents a comprehensive effort to advance the understanding and control of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter, with a specific focus on merging quantum optics, quantum information science, attosecond physics, and free-electron laser science. The doctoral candidates (DCs) in the network will receive multifaceted scientific training encompassing experimental and theoretical aspects of quantum information science, strong-field physics, and soft X-ray and X-ray science, as well as extensive training in transferable skills and self-management techniques.",4279348,2024,2028,European Commission,Germany; Spain; Germany; France; Greece; Italy; Greece; France; Spain; Germany; France; Spain; Italy; Germany; Germany; Spain; Lithuania; Italy; Sweden,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
"UPright radiotherapy: Learning, Innovation, Fellowship and Training","Radiotherapy (RT) is a mainstay of modern cancer treatment. Conventionally, RT is delivered to the patient lying on a treatment couch, while a beam steering device (gantry) aims the radiation from any angle around the target. Positioning the patients in upright body posture (upRT) instead enables to orient the patient arbitrarily toward a fixed beam. This enables smaller facility footprint and reduced treatment cost, placing upRT in the core of the UN sustainable development goals, and opening global access to advanced treatment options: 80% of cancer patients live in countries which host only 5% of the world’s RT resources. Moreover, upRT improves patient comfort and is associated with anatomical and physiological advantages, such as reduced breathing motion. 
It therefore comes as no surprise that, with new upright patient positioning & imaging solutions entering the market, upRT is enjoying a surge in interest. Yet, key scientific questions remain, international guidelines for upRT are lacking, and existing RT workflows are geared to lying patients. As the first clinics adopt new upRT technologies, there is a global need for trained professionals in industry, clinics and academia, to reach the promised benefits for patient care. 
UPLIFT builds this next generation of experts by addressing key research questions related to: treatment planning, clinical workflow and equipment design. Leveraging latest upRT technology available through our world-class consortium, UPLIFT propels Europe to the forefront of the upRT paradigm shift. UPLIFT focuses on: Learning (through its academic and clinical centres of excellence); Innovation (through its leading industrial partners); Fellowship & Training (through an outstanding cross-sector programme of workshops, secondments & mentoring). Input from patient advocacy groups and an internationally renowned advisory board will maximise its impact.

Dirac cold-source transistor technologies towards attojoule switching,"Global energy demand for information and communication technologies may reach up to 20% of total energy by the end of the decade. Innovations on transistor technologies, following Moore’s law, can in part compensate for this rise and improve sustainability by providing more energy-efficient electronics. However, the energy-efficiency of CMOS is limited by the Boltzmann physics, which sets a lower bound on the operating voltage, and thereby the power. To sustain miniaturization, and improved performance of electronics, new transistor technologies are needed that can overcome this limit.

AttoSwitch will develop a novel cold-source transistor technology that uses the intrinsically cold carrier distribution of Dirac semimetals to overcome the Boltzmann limit. The main objective is to develop a scalable Dirac transistor technology based on large-area integration of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, e.g. graphene and CoSi, and the realization of high-performance device demonstrators at technologically relevant length scales. Key demonstrators are based on graphene integrated with MoS2 and WSe2 channels, as well as novel work on 3D Dirac semimetals. Our methodology includes development of device process modules and extensive material and device characterization. Systematic modeling using new simulation frameworks plays a key part to benchmark and provide a road map for the technology. Our ambitious performance targets include a subthreshold swing of 35 mV/decade and a switching energy of 4 attojoule.

The project links to ongoing European efforts, such as the 2D-experimental pilot line, and the goals set by the European Chips Act. AttoSwitch will impact the semiconductor supply chain at the technology and materials levels, and provide ultra-energy-efficient transistors for logic and high-frequency analog integrated chip markets.

These skilled researchers will be able to explore materials science, chemistry, biology and engineering and environmental sciences with unprecedented precision (in space, time and sensitivity) using the RI techniques. They will also be trained in complementary skills in innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership providing them with the fluidity to be comfortable in all research and career settings.

NEXT GENERATION IMAGING FOR REAL-TIME DOSE VERIFICATION ENABLING ADAPTIVE PROTON THERAPY,"The NOVO project will address a fundamental issue in proton radiotherapy (PT) of cancer, namely the lack of real-time dose verification (RDV) that significantly limits the potential of PT due to uncertainties in the precise delivery of the prescribed dose. In the NOVO project, we will develop the first proof-of-concept of an RDV technology adaptable to any PT treatment and bring the concept to TRL 4 by also considering integration into the PT clinical workflow. The RDV technology will be pivotal for enabling the next generation of adaptive PT therapy, i.e., dose-guided real-time adaptive therapy. Real-time measurement of the dose to targeted and non-targeted tissues will be the key to truly empower patient-centered, personalized cancer treatment, important to improve curation and quality-of-life post-treatment. As a high-risk/high-gain project, NOVO aims at a first-of-its-kind RDV technology through the unique synergy between (1) cutting-edge, inexpensive organic scintillator technology that can detect secondary radiation during treatment for non-invasive measurements, (2) novel and fast image reconstruction, artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated models and AI-enhanced image reconstruction to allow simultaneous detection of multiple radiation species and tissue compositional analysis, (3) tumor-tracking and imaging of tissue radio-sensitivity based on oxygen levels, (4) intelligent automation of decision-making schemes for real-time dose-guided adaptive therapy. The project will essentially open a new era in PT that enables curing more cancer patients and reducing toxicity from treatment.

Chiral Light Emitting Diodes based in Photonic Architectures,"RADIANT (Chiral Light Emitting Diodes based in Photonic Architectures) is an innovative research endeavor with a transformative mission: the production of high-performing and cost-efficient chiral LEDs (light-emitting diodes) that harness the optical properties of scalable chiral metasurfaces, operating seamlessly across the visible to near-infrared spectrum. With a multifaceted approach, the project seeks to endow with chirality three distinct technologies: Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), Perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), and Quantum Dot LEDs (QdotLEDs), promising exceptionally bright output and remarkable degrees of circular polarization. These chiral LEDs find diverse applications in fields such as display technology, communications, sensing, and advanced lighting systems, promising to revolutionize various industries with their enhanced optical properties and broad spectral range. Leveraging the unique chiroptical response of chiral metasurfaces, RADIANT precisely modulates high Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY) emitters, including perovskite nanocrystals, quantum dots, and organic semiconductors, using advanced nanophotonic architectures that interact with light through optical resonances, thereby enhancing and modulating the light emission. At the core of the project lies a novel, scalable, and low carbon footprint soft nanoimprinting imprinting process that enables seamless integration of photonic nanostructures across different LED technologies in a broad spectral range.

ROOM TEMPERATURE SUPERRADIANT PEROVSKITE LASERS,"Coherent light sources are limited to state-of-the art lasers such as free-electron gas or solid-state semiconductor gain media stabilized to high-quality optical cavities. However, the mirrors in these cavities vibrate as a result of thermal noise, causing time-integrated phase drifts that limit the laser linewidth. To achieving high power and extremely narrow linewidth resembling that of single optical transitions, while also finding pathways for e-waste reduction, requires ingenious solutions in both gain material and device design but still remain elusive.

SUPERLASER aims to change the field of lasing by developing green low-cost, solution-processable efficient and ultra-narrow linewidth superradiant halide perovskite lasers. This goal will be accomplished by predicting and developing targets to transforming coherent light generation through scientific designs and strategic developments at the material and device level towards synergistic outcomes across scientific, technological and ecological boundaries. The project prioritizes research innovation and sustainability, focusing on the prediction of halide perovskites with strong inherent spu and the successful development of continuous superlatticesbased on the predicted materials. These superradiant emitters are expected to act as topological lasers without any additional cavity requirements due to photonic crystal properties endowed by their non-trivial topology. They will be applied as gain media combined with energatically-matched charge transport materials to fabricate the first electrically pumbed perovskite lasers working at room temperature. Finally, we will apply recycle and reuse protocols to ensure zero e-waste for the developed technology.",3897974,2024,2027,European Commission,Greece; Sweden; Spain; Greece; Belgium; Germany; Switzerland; United Kingdom,EU,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Quantum Physics
Exploring the sky with the Digital Telescope (DigiT),"The Digital Telescope (DT) is a large array of small stationary telescopes which, in essence, produce a movie-like data stream of the entire visible sky. The telescope detectors are run at sub-second cadence (to minimize the effects of star trailing within each image), and sidereal tracking is achieved in software - hence the name Digital Telescope. This novel concept is quite different to a traditional telescope where motorised mechanisms are needed to make the telescope usable. Eliminating telescope movement greatly simplifies the mount requirements, and allows them to be packed tightly together. The DT uses commercially off the shelf equipment to minimise construction and maintenance costs. Software is key to a viable DT, with the main challenge being the data management and real-time reduction, but we can already demonstrate a fully functional real-time pipeline. The DT is able to cheaply monitor the whole visible sky to 20-21st magnitudes (cosmologically interesting sensitivities), detecting explosive, moving, and variable objects in near real time - including those in the near-Earth environment.

We propose to build a prototype version of the DT that is capable of continuously monitoring an area of 134? × 7? using low noise scientific CMOS detectors. The sub-second cadence enables measurements of bright objects while greater sensitivity for fainter objects is obtained by stacking observations. This enables photometry of 20-21st magnitude objects at a cadence of 400 s. As the software stacking can be applied at any rate and along any vector, synthetic tracking/stacking of both stars and satellites (moving along any trajectory) is possible. Therefore, the same dataset can be used for both astronomical research via sidereal tracking or Space Domain Awareness (SDA) by tracking using satellite orbital elements. Additionally, by blind-stacking data along different trial vectors and rates, small (i.e. faint) and previously untracked space debris can be detected and catalogued. This prototype will demonstrate the capabilities of this novel concept and overcome the remaining challenges in constructing/operating an all-sky DT.",3852606,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Space Sciences
EuroFlash: exploring the origins of fast radio bursts using a network of European radio telescopes,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) present astronomers with a compelling mystery: what is creating these brilliant but ephemeral flashes that travel billions of lightyears before reaching Earth? Whatever is producing the FRBs, it requires an extreme energy density and the conditions for `laser-like’ coherent radio emission to be generated. While recent discoveries show that magnetars are a leading contender, the heterogeneous properties of the known FRB sample strongly suggest that there are multiple FRB source types. If so, then we have multiple mysterious FRB origins to uncover.

Due to the great interest in solving this puzzle, enormous progress has been made in recent years. There are now hundreds of known FRB sources, dozens of which repeat, and some of which have been localised to their exact galactic neighbourhoods. The FRB sample continues to grow at a rapid pace of several new sources per day, thanks to new wide-field radio telescopes. Studying these sources with dedicated follow-up is challenging because they emit sporadically and are only visible for milliseconds or less. At the same time, by casting an even wider net we are likely to discover new types of FRB-like signals.  

With EuroFlash, I will create a coordinated network of European radio telescopes operating over a broad range of radio frequencies, providing high sensitivity and observing cadence, and achieving the best-possible localisations. I will use this network to perform a world-leading, systematic study of repeating FRBs, to understand their progenitor(s) and their relation to the apparently one-off FRB sources. I will also make a novel exploration of the parameter space of short-duration radio transients by exploiting the large field-of-view of LOFAR2.0 and commensal observations to find new sources. In doing so, I aim to discover new types of astrophysical phenomena that probe the extremes of the Universe.",3788698,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands; Netherlands,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Intensity Correlations for Stars,"The pioneering experiments of intensity correlations by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss more than 50 years ago not only allowed to measure the angular diameter of many bright stars, but it also motivated Roy Glauber to develop his quantum formalism of photon statistics. The advent of direct optical interferences of light collected by different telescopes developed in the beginning of the 70s, with superior performances in terms of signal to noise ratio and correspondingly reduced required observation time put an end to these first attempts of intensity correlation imaging for astrophysics. State of the art optical interference imaging is however limited by accessible baselines and the required mechanical precision for optical delay lines are limited in particular due to atmospheric fluctuations and at short wavelengths. In IC4Stars we will use modern photon counting techniques to perform quantum optics measurements and probe quantum systems in astrophysics. A first target will be a quantum degenerate Fermi gaz of electrons (a white dwarf) whose angular diameter is out of reach for direct optical imaging techniques. A second goal will be the search for quantum sources of radiation by looking for random lasing in astrophysics, to be detected by second order photon correlation.",3788080,2025,2029,ERC,France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Predictive algorithms for simulating quantum materials,"This project seeks to advance the field of predictive algorithms for quantum many-body systems by developing a next-generation numerical toolset. The project will focus on combining field-theory based methods for both perturbative and non-perturbative ab-initio and model systems with innovations in tensor techniques, quantum Monte Carlo, machine learning, and numerical analysis.
By utilizing these innovative methods, we aim to deepen our understanding of quantum phases and exotic properties of materials, focusing in particular on experimentally measurable quantities.

Currently, accurate methods for studying correlated quantum materials and their excitations are lacking. Established technology either employs the so-called density functional theory, which relies on uncontrolled approximations to electron correlations and may be imprecise for systems with partially filled d- or f-shells, or proceeds by downfolding to an effective low-energy model which may capture correlations but neglects import aspects of electronic structure. Recent years have seen substantial progress in methodologies for simulating finite-temperature field theories ab-initio, using diagrammatic perturbation theory and non-perturbative embedding methods. These methodologies also take advantage of advances in numerical mathematics, computer science, and machine learning, where fast tensor algorithms such as tensor cross-interpolation techniques have been developed. We believe that by combining progress in these areas it will be possible to generate a new generation of predictive and systematically improvable algorithms for obtaining experimentally measurable properties of strongly correlated quantum materials, including angle-resolved spectroscopy, neutron spectroscopy, and resonant inelastic x-rays.

Ultimately, we aim to unlock new insights into the behavior of quantum materials, which will have profound implications for future scientific and technological advancements.",3787939,2025,2030,ERC,Poland,EU,Quantum Physics
Uncovering New Worlds: Enhancing Optical Interferometry to detect reflected light exoplanet,"The project's objective is to develop PLANETES, a pioneering ground-based interferometric system, engineered to transform the study of exoplanet atmospheres through high-contrast observations. The primary goal is to significantly enhance the dynamic range of optical interferometry, enabling the observation of exoplanets via their reflected stellar light. Other objectives include investigating the atmospheric composition of known exoplanets and identifying potential protoplanets. The strategy involves setting up a laboratory bench to scrutinize and address the current limitations observed with the GRAVITY instrument at the VLTI. These enhancements will then be deployed at the Paranal Observatory to examine the multitude of exoplanets anticipated from forthcoming Gaia spacecraft data releases. PLANETES is set to be the first ground-based instrument capable of observing exoplanets via reflected light, offering a contrast range of 10 million at less than 100 milliarcsecond. It will significantly surpass the detection and characterization capabilities of current ground-based instruments. In addition to fostering significant advancements in exoplanetary research, this project encompasses the development of a ground-breaking 4-million-pixel infrared camera. This device, equipped with a very low read noise and low dark current detector, will unveil new potential in high-contrast astronomical instrumentation.

Quantum-Optic Silicon as a Commodity: Extending the Trust Continuum till the Edge of ICT Networks,"The rapid rise of quantum computation has raised concerns about conventional encryption methods. In response to this emerging threat, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers an information-theoretically secure key exchange. However, its complexity currently hinders its widespread adoption.
QOSiLICIOUS introduces a disruptive “commodity” approach, integrating every element of quantum random number generation (QRNG) and QKD monolithically on silicon. This results in ultra-compact implementations with clear photonic/microelectronic co-integration strategy and excellent cost credentials allowing us to address new QKD markets. A pixel-size (0.01 mm²) QRNG will be realized in 0.18-µm CMOS, including a multi-dot silicon light emitting diode surrounded by a ring-shaped single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD) with co-integrated active quenching. Its true random numbers will feed a QKD transmitter developed on a silicon-photonic BiCMOS platform on a footprint of no more than 1 mm². Simplicity is ensured through a novel GeSi light emitter sourcing a BB84 polarization state encoder. This yields an all-silicon solution free from the burden of complex and costly III-V / silicon hetero-integration. The efforts on QOSiLICIOUS’ QKD transmitter are complemented by surface-normal GeSi SPAD technology for 1550-nm operation at detection efficiencies of 50% under Peltier cooling. The GeSi SPAD will be transferred to the waveguide-based silicon-photonic platform to further yield an integrated QKD receiver including BB84 state analysis.
The applicability of QOSiLICIOUS’ technology to commodity segments will be evaluated in techno-economic challenging scenarios (i) intra-datacenter interconnects, (ii) access and 6G networks and (iii) mobile applications with a close-proximity free-space optical key exchange.

HIGH-TC  JOSEPHSON NEURONS AND SYNAPSES: TOWARDS ULTRAFAST AND ENERGY EFFICIENT SUPERCONDUCTING NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING,"""We aim at realizing a novel class of high-temperature Josephson junctions (JJs) that behave as artificial neurons and synapses. These JJs will enable a new neuromorphic computing paradigm, in which neural networks are much faster, more energy efficient and compact than with non-superconducting approaches, and possess novel capabilities (combined sensitivity to light, magnetic and electric fields). Via these rupture ingredients, JOSEPHINE will dramatically enhance the impact of neuromorphics on its broad range of projected applications: from artificial intelligence (where it would allow supercomputer-level processors at a fraction of the environmental cost) to the control of autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, and novel medical applications. That constitutes the long-term vision for the science we propose. To reach that goal, we will use different strategies to realize high-Tc Josephson junctions whose weak-links are active and can be changed """"in operando"""" by external stimuli. Those strategies include """"weak links"""" modified by a nanoscale redox reaction, by the motion of domain walls in a ferromagnet, or by locally doping a graphene or a 2D semiconductor. Once realized, these JJs will be implemented and tested in neural networks to demonstrate their performance and their transformative effect on neuromorphics. The proposed strategy exploits recent breakthrough results of the partners (physical effects that will be implemented) and synergizes their complementary expertise via a multidisciplinary approach that marries traditionally distant disciplines: neural network engineering, superconducting electronics, and various facets of solid-state physics (superconductivity, magnetism, Dirac materials, and electrochemistry).""",3721722,2024,2028,European Commission,France; Germany; Spain; Spain; France; Sweden,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
Gravitational wave detectors cooled with superfluid helium,"GRAVITHELIUM addresses the central technology challenge in third generation gravitational wave (3G GW) detectors, proposing to cool the core optics of cryogenic detectors with superfluid helium. The Einstein Telescope (ET) will be the future European 3G GW observatory, designed to observe the whole Universe. It has entered the European ESFRI Roadmap in 2021 and is supported by the major international roadmaps. ET includes new technological challenges on the verge of feasibility, particularly in the cryogenic low-frequency interferometer (ET-LF) that is crucial to exploit the full scientific potential. Cryogenic operation of the ET-LF payloads at 10 K to 20 K is indispensable to suppress the fundamental suspension thermal noise (STN) to the level of Newtonian noise, requiring new key technology developments in ultra-low noise cryogenic cooling, cryopumping and thermal shielding.
GRAVITHELIUM aims for the experimental proof of a pioneering concept that proposes cryogenic payload suspensions filled with superfluid helium, as the quantum fluid He-II is the thermal reservoir that absorbs and conducts heat in the quietest possible manner. Motivated by the theoretical proof of concept, experiments on dissipative mechanisms and their STN contributions in He-II filled payload suspensions will be conducted. For this purpose, a new test facility for cryogenic Q-measurements will be build, which will also deliver data on dissipation in full-size solid-state suspensions at low temperature, needed in the GW detector community for the development of ET-LF payloads. The project further focuses on a new technology development for the attenuated and force-free supply of helium to the cryogenic payloads, cooperating with a world-leading industry partner. 
GRAVITHELIUM will thus achieve significant advancements in one of the key technologies to enable future frontier science with ET, providing also essential physical data for the modelling and engineering design of ET-LF payloads.",3658428,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Classical Physics; Quantum Physics
Quantum Control of Ultracold Molecules By Electric Fields,"The study of molecular collisions at the lowest possible energy has emerged as an exciting research frontier. At low energies the wave-character of matter leads to exotic scattering phenomena that reveal the fundamental mechanisms of molecular collisions. Crossed beam methods are ideal to probe collisions with the highest detail, but the lowest energy currently achievable is not sufficient to fully harvest these possibilities. Building upon my recent breakthrough in state-to-state merged beam scattering at record-low energies, the aim of this project is to reduce the currently attainable collision energy by another 2-3 orders of magnitude by combining Stark deceleration, merged beams, laser cooling and velocity map imaging. Using two distinct systems that are characteristic for a large class of molecular interactions, I will measure hitherto unexplored quantum features in the state-to-state integral and differential cross sections. For atom-molecule systems, I will measure scattering resonances and image how the resonance region dominated by a few partial waves evolves into the pure quantum regime where only a single partial wave remains. For collisions between dipolar molecules, I will experimentally study a peculiar self-polarizing effect, probing fundamental features of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction that can be steered from attractive to repulsive. For both systems, I will manipulate the cross sections using external electric fields, and study how the partial waves transform during the collision. The proposed research program will directly visualize how molecular collisions transform from “hot” into “ultracold” at the full quantum mechanical level, providing excellent tests for quantum theories of molecular interactions. It will bridge the gap between the ultracold quantum physics and physical chemistry communities, and will lay the foundations for a new era in the rich history of elucidating molecular reaction dynamics using crossed molecular beams.",3629111,2025,2030,ERC,Netherlands,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
3D silicon detector for imaging of diagnostic  and therapeutic nuclear medicine radiotracers with outstanding efficiency and high spatial resolution.,"This project aims to design, construct, and evaluate a novel instrument for molecular imaging of radioactive nuclides in the human body. The hypothesis is that, by using next-generation silicon sensors to measure each photon interaction and applying kinematic constraints, the incident photon direction can be calculated. Thus, we can remove state-of-the-art mechanical collimators. The main objective of this project is to explore the physical limits of efficiency and spatial resolution and evaluate the concept for this new technology in medical imaging applications.

The new instrument should improve detector efficiency by about a factor of one million, reducing examination time from an hour to less than a second.  The concept aims to overcome Compton cameras' shortcomings such as complicated geometries with low efficiency, that, despite several attempts, prevented this technique from going beyond an early prototype stage. 

The new sensor concept consists of a massive block of silicon built up from a multitude of sensors, with high resolution in space, energy and time and including signal shaping and data processing. The system will have orders of magnitude more read-out pixels than ever before in medical imaging. The system design and image reconstruction process are conceptually challenging, addressing several scientific problems at the component level such as pixel charge collection and capacitance, but also including image reconstruction from fragments of event circles, combinatorial problems involved with tracing each event to discern the correct order of interactions and to reject background events. Over a 10–20-year period, the technology could replace the current installed base, leading to significant impacts on adjacent research fields, such as drug development and targeted radionuclide therapy.",3628360,2024,2029,ERC,Sweden; Italy,EU,Synchrotrons and Accelerators
ENABLING NEW QUANTUM FRONTIERS WITH SPIN ACOUSTICS IN SILICON,"Although silicon has been the defining material of classical information processing, it is currently not the main material advanced for quantum information processing. It would however be very compelling to leverage the existing multibillion euro silicon infrastructure. Silicon spin qubits have already been shown to have excellent single-qubit properties, combining long coherence times with high-fidelity readout and control. The reason silicon qubits are not yet seen as a mainstream platform for quantum computing is mainly due to the lack of convenient coupling and readout mechanisms that could be used to scale-up to practical level. This proposal addresses both deficiencies and aims to enable a long-term future for donor spin qubits in silicon in Europe, for both quantum processing and quantum sensing applications.

This project will provide a scalable solution for all the important aspects of a quantum platform: control and readout, spin-spin coupling, and routing quantum information on-chip. In parallel, we will advance the needed material science methods, concentrating especially on deterministic single-ion doping, isotopical purification and strain tuning of silicon.

The end product of the project will be a complete quantum information platform including qubits, interconnects and scalable control and readout electronics. The platform will be based on embedded atomic spins as qubits, phonons as interconnects and gate defined quantum dots with on-chip multiplexing and amplification as readout devices. The project will bring together the relevant parties in Europe into a collaboration that will form a new hub for donor spin-based silicon quantum computing.

High Angular Resolution Community Science at the CHARA Array,"The Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array is the nation’s premier facility for long baseline optical interferometry. With the number and size of its telescopes, the length of its baselines, and the range of wavelengths covered by its beam combiners, the CHARA Array is a uniquely powerful facility for milliarcsecond imaging. With adaptive optics and four new beam combiners, the Array is reaching deeper than ever. Since 2004 CHARA results have appeared in some 245 papers in the refereed literature. This includes observations obtained during the high-demand open access program supported by NSF for some years, and operated in collaboration with NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Research Laboratory. This award extends that program for another three years, and includes a new snapshot imaging mode. The team also plans to offer user support, community workshops, and an accessible data archive. CHARA will foster collaborations with amateur astronomers through the American Association of Variable Star Observers. CHARA trains graduate students to build and use precision technology. The CHARA Array achieves sub-milliarcsecond resolution at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and can be used to resolve the radii of stars all along the main sequence and at different stages as stars evolve off the main sequence. The Array reveals the impact of limb- and gravity-darkening, the spatial distribution and size of star-spots and activity in convection zones, and provides physical properties of exoplanet host stars. The CHARA Array resolves binary stars, maps orbits, and probes interacting systems. Extragalactic observations probe the structure of Active Galactic Nuclei cores to show how supermassive black holes impact accretion and trigger outflows. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",3500000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
The Quantum-Optical Twist and Scan Microscope - imaging strongly correlated matter on the nanoscale,"Research in condensed matter physics primarily focuses on understanding and tuning of electronic and magnetic phases. Strong electronic correlations that typically underpin exotic phases in the solid-state emerge when Coulomb interactions compete with, or dominate over, kinetic energy. Insights from the theoretical work on the Fermi-Hubbard model suggest that it is possible to engineer quantum entangled electronic states from materials that otherwise do not exhibit correlation effects by subjecting electrons to a periodic lattice potential. A key requirement for understanding emergent strongly correlated phases in this generic platform is the in-situ tunability of the system parameters, including the dispersion of the electronic bands and the lattice structure. An equally important additional requirement is the possibility to carry out measurements of charge and spin degrees of freedom of individual electrons with nanometer-scale spatial resolution.In this project, we propose to develop and implement a novel experimental tool, termed the quantum optical twist and scan microscope (QOTSM), which would allow us to address both of these challenges, and achieve not only unprecedented tunability of electronic properties of a synthetic quantum material but also demonstrate a new microscopy technique that achieves unprecedented spatial resolution in both electric and magnetic field sensing. Our research will focus on developing and using QOTSM for investigating and imaging strongly correlated electronic and magnetic phases in van der Waals moire structures.Our proposal builds up on three recent developments: the first key advance is the demonstration of strongly correlated phases in twisted bilayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), exhibiting flat  Hubbard bands with a bandwidth that is determined by the twist angle. The second key advance is the recent realization of a Quantum Twist Microscope (QTM) by one of us (S.I.): combining these two developments would allow us to realize the first operation mode of the QOTSM where we would achieve tunable quantum correlations through the control of the twist angle as well as the the pressure applied by the flat tip.  The third recent advance that enables the use of a QOTSM as a scanning microscope is the discovery of bright quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride or in monolayer TMDs with a spatial extent of ~1 nanometer, as well as the realization of scanning NV-magnetometry. The imaging modality of QOTSM is based on scanning a flat tip incorporating a single quantum emitter or a defect, over a substrate hosting an electronic or magnetic moire material with a fixed twist angle. To establish the power of QOTSM as a quantum sensor, we propose to image charge or spin configuration, as well as correlations, of the strongly correlated electronic or magnetic states with ~1 nanometer resolution. The quantum optical charge and spin sensing are free of measurement back-action and can also be used to image insulating samples by sensing spatial variations in the dielectric properties. We aim to pursue four different but complementary tracks for realizing defect-based quantum sensing, each with different advantages as well as challenges.The ambitious goal of revolutionizing scanning super-resolution microscopy by exploiting unique features of 2D materials requires bringing together expertise in disparate fields of research. The interdisciplinary team we put together will combine the QTM with confocal optical microscopy and verify the operation of the resulting microscope by investigating strongly correlated phases of matter at cryogenic temperatures. An immediate extension of this project would be the implementation of a QOTSM using room temperature bright quantum emitters: such a device could find truly ground-breaking applications in biology where it could open up the possibility to image/measure local potentials and fast dynamics with nanoscale spatial resolution.",3467060,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
New physics in parity violation. From the Thomson limit to the energy frontier,"The theory of elementary particle physics, the Standard Model (SM), provides a successful description of the basic constituents of matter and the forces acting between them. However, it explains only about 15 % of the total mass in the universe, not accounting for the dark matter postulated in the face of astrophysical and cosmological data. The study of the universe at large shows that our theory of the smallest entities of Nature must be extended.

In the absence of a direct observation of new particles it becomes increasingly important to determine the parameters of the SM with the highest possible precision, as new particles and forces would modify their values through quantum effects. The existence of the W and Z bosons, and later the top quark, the tau neutrino, and the Higgs boson - the ultimate discovery of the SM - were all inferred from precision measurements before their direct observations.

A cornerstone parameter of the SM is the so-called weak mixing angle, which relates different sectors of the theory and is particularly sensitive to new physics. The objective of this project is to greatly improve its determination, at energy scales spanning four orders of magnitude, combining information from the LHC with low-energy data from the MESA accelerator. Detector techniques developed for the LHC will be used to optimise the measurements at low energy. The combination of all measurements will test the energy dependence of the weak mixing angle, below the Z peak, on the resonance, and for the first time above the Z, towards the weak scale.

Reaching these objectives requires improving theoretical predictions in the SM beyond the current state of the art, reducing the associated uncertainties. The simultaneous interpretation of the weak mixing angle determinations at all energies will test the SM, and probe new physics with sensitivity to mass scales ranging from 70 MeV up to the order of 100 TeV, corresponding to length scales of a zeptometer.",3467044,2024,2029,ERC,France; Germany; France,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Surfing radio Waves to detect  liquId water in the solar systeM,"In the near future a number of space missions will aim to study the icy Galilean satellites of Jupiter to detect subglacial liquid water, using radar sounders. To properly interpret the radar data, it is necessary to understand the dielectric properties of the icy shells of these bodies, as they control radar signal penetration and anomaly (i.e., water) detection. The current knowledge of these properties for the types of water ices believed to be present is limited, which would potentially produce incorrect interpretations of the radar data, thus risking the scientific goals of these missions. Based on extensive experience in characterizing the dielectric properties of planetary analogues, which led me and my group to discover the first extraterrestrial subglacial stable body of liquid water on Mars, we intend to develop new methodologies and protocols to create a groundbreaking knowledgebase that fills this critical gap. We will apply the first of its kind methodology for conducting dielectric measurements across a wide range of frequencies (including the challenging interval used by these radar systems) and temperatures representative of the different ice-forming environments, produce groundbreaking studies on the structural and chemical behavior of different ice types using CT microtomography and molecular dynamic modelling, and will create a wide-ranging dataset of the dielectric properties of non-terrestrial ices. Such pioneering and high gain research will allow to obtain the maximum benefit from missions such as JUICE and Europa CLIPPER. By the end of the project significant and fundamental progress will be made to properly perform dielectric measurements on icy planetary analogues, in the comprehension of the physics behind the dielectric behavior of water ice and icy materials, and in radar data modelling and interpretation. Moreover, the project’s results will serve as a critical knowledge base for present and future radar sounder planetary missions.",3438826,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Quantum Dot coupling engineering (and dynamic spin decoupling/deep nuclei cooling): 2-dimensional cluster state generation for quantum information processing,"The overarching objective of QCEED is to find solutions to current bottlenecks to photonic quantum information processing. “Scalable” photonic universal quantum computation exploits the measurement-based quantum computing paradigm relying on multi-dimensional photonic cluster states.

However, the technological capability to generate on-demand, large-scale 2-dimensional cluster states has not yet been proven.
QCEED will demonstrate the (large-scale, i.e., many photons) emission of 2-dimensional cluster states of light thanks to the development of new engineered paired semiconductor quantum dot (QD) systems, and the exploitation of advanced deep nuclei cooling and/or dynamic spin decoupling to improve system coherence time.

To achieve this, one needs to deterministically design QD coupling/pairing and ultimately tailor specific molecular states/architectures (lambda like energy levels). Conventionally exploited self-assembled QD systems (e.g., SK or droplet epitaxy QD systems) are in general not suited for the task. QCEED will attack the issue with a twin-track approach and demonstrate the advantage of MOVPE site-controlled (In)GaAs pyramidal QDs and CBE InAsP nanowire QDs. 

QCEED will also tackle the essential requirement for scalable quantum computation -that is to efficiently funnel the generated photons into specific photonic modes- by implementing tailored tapered wave-guiding designs and broadband optical cavities with relatively high Purcell factors. 

QCEED brings together 7 partners from 5 countries which combined possess all the complementary expertise necessary to fulfil the ambitious objectives and to prepare a post-project sustainability and exploitability plan.

The combined effort will result in a new scalable platform of semiconductor sources of multidimensional cluster states for efficient quantum information processing.

Quantum enhANched phoTonic Integrated sensors For metrologY,"Over the years sensors expanded their field of use from scientific exploration to consumer electronics, and their market evolved accordingly. Quantum technologies are expected to further push sensor’s performances, unlocking even more application domains, exploiting non-classical correlation of light and matter to extract the relevant information beyond the limit dictated by classical noise processes, improving performances such as sensitivity, specificity and uncertainty. The ability to produce, control and measure quantum states in transportable devices is the key to extend the sensors’ operating environment, lifetime, power consumption and costs. QUANTIFY fits perfectly this vision and the goal of Demonstrating quantum sensing beyond classical capabilities for real-world applications, in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Quantum Flagship Program. QUANTIFY objective consists in bringing photonic quantum enhanced sensors at the next level of integration developing the essential building blocks and novel quantum-enhanced techniques for future chip scale optical clocks, optically pumped magnetometers and optomechanical temperature sensors. QUANTIFY leverages different photonic platforms combined by a novel hybrid integration technique to bring the key optical and optomechanical functionalities on a single chip. To increase the clock and magnetometer performances, we introduce a photonic integrated squeezed light source, also becoming an important step for realizing a universal quantum computer based on photonics. Finally, we demonstrate a novel absolute temperature sensor with an extended detection range, from cryogenic to room temperature leveraging a nanoscale optomechanical approach coupling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom. 
All the free developed sensors will be assessed using metrological protocols and national primary standards in National metrological laboratories, to foster their feature exploitation in real application for end-users.",3247467,2024,2027,European Commission,Italy; Switzerland; Belgium; Spain; Germany; Netherlands; France; France; France; France; France; France,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Capacitation of Quantum-Entangled NV-Center Sensing,"C-QuENS is an innovative research project aimed at advancing the field of quantum sensing by developing the next generation of NV-centre-based quantum sensors with quantum entanglement-enhanced performances. To achieve this goal, C-QuENS brings together six world-leading experts from four European countries who have made pioneering contributions to this research field that are essential for the realisation of the C-QuENS research vision.
The project will focus on developing novel sensing protocols based on engineered correlated quantum spin states, such as entangled states and dynamical phase transitions. These protocols will outperform current quantum sensing scenarios based on independent spins in terms of sensitivity and precision. The development of these protocols will build on strong theoretical support with the development of quantum control methods, advanced signal processing protocols and experiment modelling, optimisation and analysis.
C-QuENS will conduct laboratory demonstrations of these protocols using multi-qubit quantum registers undergoing magnetic dipolar interaction to create multi-qubit entanglement and many-body dynamics. In addition, the project aims to bridge the knowledge and technical gaps to implement laboratory prototypes of NV-based quantum devices that can find application in a wide range of fields as diverse as semiconductor testing or medicine. These objectives will leverage pivotal advances in diamond quantum-capable materials, including NV growth control and surface treatments.
The outcomes of C-QuENS will be disseminated to the scientific community, industry, and society to promote the adoption of these technologies and maximize their impact in basic science, material manufacturing, microelectronics, healthcare, and metrology. The project will also contribute to training quantum-literate physicists and engineers and to consolidate the European supply chain on diamond quantum sensors, crucial to maintain Europe's competitiveness.",3247451,2024,2027,European Commission,Spain; Belgium; Germany; Czechia; Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
The Wide-Field Spectroscopic Telescope,"We propose a conceptual design study for a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST’s uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The study will deliver telescope and instrument designs, cost estimates, an updated science white paper and survey plan, concept studies for data management, and a facility operation concept. The telescope and instruments will be designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next ESO project after completion of the 39-metre ELT. Our consortium includes institutes from Australia, which has a strategic partnership with ESO and aims to apply shortly for full membership. Together with ESO and institutes in 9 European countries, our team has the necessary technical and scientific expertise, and brings 70 years of in-kind effort to the proposed study.",3247402,2025,2028,European Commission,France; Poland; Austria; France; Australia; Germany; Australia; Germany; Switzerland; Australia; Italy; United Kingdom; Australia; Australia; Italy; Netherlands; United Kingdom; Australia,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Neuromorphic Polariton Accelerator,"Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter particles, have recently come into the spotlight for their peculiar properties (sizable interaction, small mass, long coherence, etc.) leading to spectacular effects such as phase transitions, superfluidity, bistability, ultra-efficient fourwave-mixing, and quantum blockade. On the other hand, polaritons have also been proposed for different kinds of devices (including optical switches, transistors, low threshold lasers and simulators), with beautiful experiments showing proofs-of-principle. However, it is only recently that polaritons have been operating efficiently at room temperature, giving the promise of a real technological impact in the future. In a recent work, made by some of the theoretical and experimental partners of this proposal, we could demonstrate that such hybrid state of matter, when used for realising artificial neural networks, shows extremely interesting performances in terms of speed and success rate.
Given the strong interest in the realisation of hardware-based (not simulated) artificial neural networks, the goal of PolArt is to demonstrate a new way to build artificial intelligence-dedicated circuits using polariton neural networks as optical accelerators.
Thanks to this new concept device, complex applications related to neural-like processing, will be efficiently implemented, therefore enabling neuromorphic computation to be done in small devices that cannot rely on remote, large bandwidth connection. This proposal benefits from the contribution of several complementary partners coming from many different research areas (material science, physics, optics, chemistry, genetics) and industrial participants that assure the interdisciplinarity and technological oriented target.",3244908,2024,2028,European Commission,Poland; Singapore; Italy; Poland; Italy; Poland; France,EU,Quantum Physics
Bimodal Ammonia Nuclear Thermal and Electric Rocket,"BANTER represents the first step towards realizing an innovative bimodal nuclear thermal and electric propulsion system in which the same fluid (i.e. ammonia) is used as a propellant for thermo-nuclear propulsion and electric thrusters and as a working fluid for the power generation system. Due to its ease of storage in non-cryogenic conditions, its presence as an in-situ resource on many targets of future space missions, and its possibility of decomposing to increase the propulsive performance, ammonia allows the development of a compact propulsion system capable of transporting tons of payloads for a wide spectrum of missions. The design and verification through analysis of a nuclear reactor implementing a new type of coolant channels and a radiator-less power generation system fed by ammonia will constitute the first phase of this process. Then, the combination of the thermolysis, catalysis, and radiolysis processes to decompose the ammonia will be studied through two experimental campaigns carried out on prototypes of the coolant channels both in a nuclear and non-nuclear environment with the aim of demonstrating propulsive performance capable of outclassing traditional chemical propulsion systems. Moreover, another phase of design, development, and testing will demonstrate the ability of a cluster of newly designed ammonia electric thrusters to operate for long periods without excessive cathode erosion, eventually with increased efficiency due to the catalytic decomposition of the propellant. Positive outcomes of the project will pave the way for developing a technology that could make Europe a protagonist of the future space race thanks to a compact, versatile, and high-performance propulsion system. In addition, any improvement in the production of green hydrogen from ammonia decomposition will benefit also for the energy industry. This aspect makes this project highly multidisciplinary not only in the research approach but also in the results.",3244535,2025,2029,European Commission,Italy; Czechia; Germany,EU,Engineering; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Quantum technology with a spin-photon architecture for thousand-qubit chipsets at telecom wavelengths,"Scalability is one of the core challenges of present-day quantum technology. While many promising demonstrations have been performed at the level of tens of qubits, a vast leap will be required to create systems with the many thousands of physical qubits with the outstanding quality needed for the achievement of quantum computational advantage and high-bandwidth quantum communication. Spin centres in silicon carbide are an emerging platform for quantum information and communication. Some of these systems have long spin lifetimes and strong optical transitions in the near infrared optical spectrum. This optical band is advantageous for strong photonic enhancement, and for interfacing with low-loss waveguide and fiber networks. These defects possess electronic spins for photonic links, and nuclear spins for quantum information storage. The multilevel systems furthermore offer a platform for novel, resource-efficient quantum information methods based on high-dimensional encoding. 
Silicon carbide is a highly developed material platform, offering extremely high purity, transparency, and compatibility with eminently scalable semiconductor processing methods. 
In QuSPARC, we will develop and demonstrate wafer-scale processes to create thousands of near-identical qubit sites with spin control on a SiC wafer, and with optical enhancement interfaces using optical micro-resonators of extremely high quality. We will determine optimized methods for the control and readout of selected spin centres in SiC towards fault-tolerant implementations. Based on these insights, we will demonstrate high-fidelity spin initialization, spin measurement, spin-photon entanglement, and connectivity between sites on these microchips. QuSPARC will thereby achieve a disruptive step change in the development of scalable quantum information devices, leading the race towards the creation of million-qubit systems for high-performance quantum technology.",3239208,2025,2028,European Commission,Austria; Sweden; Hungary; United Kingdom; Germany; Netherlands; Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Coherent control of spin chains in graphene nanostructures,"Elementary nuclear and electronic spins are called to be key components in the second quantum revolution. Their atomic-scale integration into scalable platforms with tunable interactions is a demand that I will address in CONSPIRA by synthetizing graphene architectures with interacting spin chains, using customized on-surface reactions of organic precursors, and by controlling their quantum state through microwave spectroscopies.    
             
I envision the formation of collective magnetic states through the assembly of interacting electronic and nuclear spins in periodic arrays with atomically precise spacings. Through rational design and synthesis strategies, we will tune spin interactions via the graphene host and hyperfine coupling, with the goal of bringing the quantum state of the arrays into different regimes of energy, coherence, and topology.  
 
To access the broad energy range of such multiscale interacting system and to probe its quantum dynamics, we will combine two antagonist experimental techniques like Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) and Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This will be realized by incorporating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators (CWRs) as substrate of a low temperature STM. 

We will use QED techniques to couple the resonant states of spin chains with microwave photons of the resonator, while the STM tip acts as a local gate. The MHz and picometer resolution of this new type of spectrometer will enable us to study the quantum coherence of the spin arrays and undertake the coherent control of distant nuclear states entangled through the electronic spin system, a potential system for QED-based quantum computation. 

CONSPIRA will provide a new platform for quantum spins, and methods to address and manipulate their coherent state. The combination of QED and STM represents a ground-breaking experimental development, which is called to boost studies of general correlated phenomena in condensed matter physics.",3235280,2024,2028,ERC,Spain,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Spectroscopy for Strain-Modulated Terahertz Magnonics,"Motivated by the recent discovery of a giant strain-induced blue-shift of Terahertz antiferromagnetic spin waves (magnons) in the spin-orbit Mott insulators Sr2IrO4 and Ca2RuO4 by the PI and his group, the SpecTera project will explore whether strain modulation can be harnessed to confine and guide THz magnons.  To probe magnetic order and magnon excitations in inhomogeneous strain environments with high energy and momentum resolution, we will develop a combination of Raman, Brillouin, and resonant x-ray scattering instruments, including a new “momentum microscopy” facility that will generate momentum-space images of magnetic order and excitations with micro-focused x-ray beams. To establish a materials platform for SpecTera, we will use these instruments for surveys of the strain response of different spin-orbit Mott insulators, including compounds with antiferromagnetic order above room temperature. The magnetic ground state and excitations of selected model compounds will be mapped out in carefully tailored strain environments in thermal equilibrium, followed by experiments to probe their response to controlled non-equilibrium situations including thermal gradients and local excitation of magnons by intense sub-THz sources.  Inspired by methods developed in semiconductor physics, we will pattern strain profiles by electron beam lithography and assess their ability to serve as magnon conduits. Finally, we will explore the interaction of magnons in spin-orbit Mott insulators with dynamic strain generated by surface acoustic waves.

SpecTera will create a new nexus between the rapidly evolving research fields of Terahertz magnonics and correlated-electron physics, and harness the resulting synergies to explore pathways towards a novel architecture of magnonic devices.",3213619,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
eXtreme BENDing strain induced novel interfaces in single crystal cantilevers of strongly correlated metals,"The ground state of correlated materials is controlled by tuning parameters such as pressure or strain, which are usually applied homogeneously to crystals. Here we aim for strong yet controlled strain gradient fields in microstructured correlated crystals that selectively transform parts of the structure into different electronic ground states. XBENDs ambition is to open a new field of research into gradient quantum matter, defined as a highly non-linear regime in which gradients lead to qualitatively new behavior as compared to simple spatial distributions of bulk phases.

The concrete goal is a rational design of new electronic properties at interfaces between different correlated ground states within a single crystal – akin to the interface states between different materials in heterostructures. Specifically, we aim to frustrate interactions and/or competing orders in unconventional superconductors at this interface, with the goal to enhance the transition temperature Tc. We will create interfaces between (1) ferro-polar and paraelectric phases in crystals of doped SrTiO3; (2) oppositely detwinned domains in underdoped Ba(Fe,Co)2As2 crystals; (3) hidden-order and magnetic phases in URu2Si2. Contrasting their nature and physical responses to those expected from trivial phase mixtures will signal that XBEND has entered a non-linear gradient-driven regime. 

Technically, we will fabricate free-standing single crystal cantilevers from as-grown crystals using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) machining. The cantilevers will be functionalized to allow cryogenic measurements of magnetoresistance while applying bending strain by pushing them with a piezoelectric motor. XBEND aims for extreme strain gradients in the 10%/micron range, yet our proof-of-concept already demonstrated 2%/micron. The induced microscopic strain/domain pattern will be probed by X-Ray microdiffraction at DESY/PETRA III, and a complete finite-element-model will capture the elasto-resistive response.",3201081,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Chemical Sciences; Engineering; Quantum Physics
Tau-E Breakthrough (TauEB): Infinite clean energy through fusion power to the grid & beyond,"Nuclear fusion could provide humankind with an unlimited supply of clean, safe and sustainable energy, which would mean forgetting about the dire effects of fossil fuels. However, after almost a century of billion-dollar investments in nuclear fusion research, continuous fusion reactions have not been achieved yet due to the extremely challenging scientific and technical barriers that must be overcome. The performance of a fusion power plant is fundamentally dependent on the quality of confinement. For the confinement to be effective, it must satisfy two crucial criteria: 1) Stability and 2) The ability to maintain plasma over time with negligible leakage.  

Building upon the revolutionary mirror fusion concept by Novatron, which inherently stabilizes the plasma, the Tau-E Breakthrough project (TauEB) is designed to provide essential plasma plugs. These plugs are crucial for confining the plasma over an extended period, making it scalable to a fusion reactor that generates energy at a competitive Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). This radically new design will make it possible to bring nuclear fusion technology to the commercial stage in record time, thus changing our lives not only by creating a multi-billion euro market, but above all by providing great social, environmental, economic and geopolitical benefits. 

To successfully achieve the project’s goals and maximise the impact of its results, we have brought together a multidisciplinary consortium combining the deep knowledge of KTH, KIPT and UKAEA in different complementary fields of nuclear fusion research (magnetic confinement, plasma stability, advanced simulation methods, radio frequency plasma heating, ponderomotive plugging and diagnostics), NFG’s revolutionary Novatron concept and its outstanding technological implementation skills (system design, mechanical design, instrumentation and plasma diagnostics), and IE’s outstanding innovation and exploitation management advice.",3187818,2024,2027,European Commission,Sweden; Netherlands; United Kingdom; Ukraine,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics

Gecko Inspired Autonomous Fabrication Of Programmable Two-dimensional Quantum Materials,"Atomically thin materials provide a wide range of fundamental semiconductor device building blocks with unique electronic and optical properties which do not exist in the bulk. Remarkably, the atomic sheets can be stacked together without restriction to form heterostructures with unprecedented properties and capabilities. To date, heterostructure devices consisting of only a handful of individual atomic layers have led to extraordinary breakthroughs in photonics, electronics, and quantum materials. A tantalizing dream is to go beyond these few-layer systems and construct designer materials comprised of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of atomic layers, each precisely chosen and placed. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art layer-by-layer fabrication of such structures is tedious, low-yield, and not reproducible at the quantum level.

Inspired by nature, 2D-Gecko aims to revolutionize the layer-by-layer-fabrication of heterostructures to realize highly reproducible materials and devices of limitless complexity. We will pioneer ""smart"" pick-and-place assembly of individual atomic sheets using microfibril arrays, similar to a gecko, to achieve reversible adhesion - switchable via mechanical actuation. We will incorporate this technology into a fully autonomous pilot line, combining robotic control of all assembly steps with efficient computer-vision, machine intelligence algorithms, and in-situ metrology techniques for quality control. The pilot line will be exploited to fabricate highly tunable quantum materials based on stacking layers with a relative twist (so-called moiré heterostructures) in a reproducible and deterministic fashion. Ultimately, we aim to realize scalable moiré materials, with reproducibility at the quantum level, such that programmable three-dimensional moiré solids can be realized.",3071936,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Quantum Physics

PARCOVAL’s aim is to leverage the recognised catalytic capabilities of radioactive PGM (specifically the palladium -Pd) to demonstrate their potential for use and market. PARCOVAL will create 2 circular loops from 2 wastes: 1) recover Pd from spent nuclear fuel (today vitrified and considered a nuclear waste) and 2) reuse the CO2 produced by an existing industry.
Pd will be extracted from streams generated in a spent nuclear fuel recycling plant and valorised as catalyst to perform CO2 electroreduction into CO. Performances achieved into CO conversion will be compared between radioactive Pd and natural Pd catalyst at industrial scale (100cm2 electrodes integrated in electrolyser). Catalytic mechanisms involved will be studied to explain the contribution of radioactive radiation during CO2 reduction. The CO2 will be supplied by industrial production units of anaerobic digestion.
Focus will be on the characterisation of the CO generated and the non-radioactive gas contamination to consider a transfer into a non-nuclear environment plant will also be demonstrated. A use case to valorise the CO will be studied to produce succinic anhydride which can be incorporated in polyesters through copolymerisation.
PARCOVAL will conduct a Life Cycle Analysis to compare environmental impacts of using radioactive Pd and mining extracted Pd to produce succinic anhydride.

Multi-messenger Studies of Extragalactic Super-colliders,"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. They convert the gravitational energy of matter accreted by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) into electromagnetic and kinetic energy, producing highly relativistic electrons and protons. They are most likely originated from the vicinity of SMBHs, but the exact mechanism of their production remains elusive. Electrons are predominantly found in jets, whose acceleration and collimation are still poorly understood. Even less clear is how and where protons are accelerated and how this process is connected to neutrino production. The importance of investigating such high-energy particles transcends astrophysics, as they probe regimes that particle accelerators on Earth will likely never reach.

The recent detection of a high-energy neutrino signal from the blazar TXS 0506+056 by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has brought up new multi-messenger opportunities for AGN studies which can be now most efficiently explored. This proposal sets its main aim on carrying out such an exploration and addressing the pivotal questions about proton acceleration, jet formation and collimation, and neutrino production in AGN. To achieve these goals, we will perform and utilize observations of AGN across the electromagnetic spectrum, with a particular focus on high-resolution very-long-baseline interferometry and data collected by high-energy neutrino telescopes.

The information and insight gathered through these investigations will provide the most accurate clues about the extreme energy output in AGN and transform these objects into well-understood cosmic laboratories which can probe physical conditions unachievable in any experiments performed on Earth.",3030944,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Frequency-agile integrated photonic light sources across the visible and near-infrared spectrum,"Lasers are ubiquitous in science and technology, with applications ranging from optical communications and quantum technologies to metrology and sensing and to life sciences and medical diagnostics. However, most commercially used lasers are still based on legacy optical schemes. These devices are either bulky and expensive limiting product development, or lack the ability to quickly sweep or precisely control the laser wavelength, which is key to many applications. At the same time, the advent of advanced photonic integration platforms such as silicon photonics has opened new perspectives, realized only for exascale data centers in telecommunication wavelengths around 1310 and 1550 nm.
AgiLight aims at establishing a new class of integrated lasers that can address the entire wavelength range from the blue (400 nm) to the infrared (2.7 µm). These devices rely on a hybrid integration platform that combines ultra-low-loss silicon nitride photonic circuits with advanced tuning actuators and with III-V gain elements, exploiting highly scalable assembly concepts based on 3D printing. The devices will offer high output powers (> 100 mW), down to Hz-level laser linewidths, and unprecedented frequency agility with nanosecond response times and wideband tunability. Comprising leading European research groups and high-tech start-ups as well as a major industrial player, AgiLight will translate ground-breaking research to rapid technology uptake and tailor laser systems for atomic and molecular physics and optics, distance ranging and sensing using the expertise of end-users. The project covers the theoretical and nanofabrication foundations of the envisaged light sources as well as their implementation and functional demonstration in highly relevant research applications throughout the visible and near-infrared spectrum. AgiLight will lay the foundation for an all-European value chain of a novel class of light sources, covering the III-V and low-loss PICs.",3016329,2024,2028,European Commission,France; Poland; Switzerland; Italy; Germany; Poland,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Advanced Leidenfrost Effect,"When a liquid droplet is placed on a solid surface with a temperature significantly higher than the boiling point of the liquid, the droplet hovers above the surface on a thin layer of its own vapor, a phenomenon known as the Leidenfrost effect. While this effect is highly undesirable in certain cooling applications due to the reduced energy transfer between the solid and evaporating liquid caused by the poor heat conductivity of the vapor, it can be of significant interest in various processes where avoiding contact with the surface is advantageous.

The LeidenForce project aims to comprehensively study the Leidenfrost effect and propose novel applications, either to mitigate its adverse effects or leverage its advantages. LeidenForce intends to (i) shift the fundamental understanding of the transition to the Leidenfrost state, (ii) optimize the heat transfer between the droplet and the substrate, (iii) utilize the isolated droplet to manipulate small amounts of liquid in unconventional scenarios (e.g., on a liquid surface, within a channel), and (iv) harness the vapor film to capture or confine particles using an external electrical field.

The practical implications will be leveraged by non-academic institutions involved in aviation (such as AIRBUS), metallurgy (CRM), cryogenics (Air Liquide), and space exploration (Centre Spatial de Liège). In aviation, managing cryogenic fuel is a crucial step toward achieving zero-emission flights. In metallurgy, innovative cooling methods will be developed based on mitigating the Leidenfrost effect. Air Liquide will address cooling issues by introducing particles into the evaporating liquid to modify the Leidenfrost effect. Lastly, at the Centre Spatial de Liège, Leidenfrost droplets will be utilised to delicately clean surfaces by trapping particles within these contactless droplets.",2967107,2025,2029,European Commission,Belgium; Austria; France; France; France; France; Netherlands; Belgium; Belgium; France; France; Norway,EU,Classical Physics
Exotic quantum states by locally-broken inversion symmetry in extreme conditions.,"Strong correlations between electrons in solids lead to a variety of exotic quantum states like Mott insulator, unconventional high-Tc or odd-parity superconductivity. The groundbreaking discoveries of these states have not only generated huge advances in our understanding of condensed matter but also uncover a great potential for applications such as room-temperature superconductivity or quantum computing.

Symmetry is an important concept in classifying quantum states. So far, the majority of research has focused on global symmetry. I have recently discovered striking experimental evidence that local inversion symmetry breaking opens up a new route for the appearance of novel quantum states of matter. Namely, it can induce novel types of odd-parity superconductivity with possibly topological character, a much-needed state for topological quantum computing. However, the effect of local inversion symmetry breaking on quantum states still lacks our control and understanding. 

In the Ixtreme project, I propose to generalise and exploit this concept by investigating materials with locally broken inversion symmetry as a platform of exotic quantum states. By measuring electric and thermal transport as well as magnetic properties in extreme conditions of very low temperature, high magnetic field and high hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure, the Ixtreme team will study and control the delicate interplay of local inversion-symmetry breaking with correlated electrons, magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom, topology, and superconductivity. Thereby, this project will establish new understanding of the physical properties of this promising novel class of unconventional metals and lead to new design methodologies for emergent states such as odd-parity superconductivity in locally non-centrosymmetric correlated electron systems.",2956534,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Controlled transport of water and ions in nanoconfinement,"A new technology is emerging, based on controlled transport of matter through channels with dimensions from Ångströms to nanometres. On these scales, the macroscopic description of transport phenomena breaks down, and it is necessary to integrate experiments with fully atomistic model calculations, and control non-equilibrium dynamics. Recent exciting developments in experimental and theoretical methods mean that we are
finally at a stage where exploration of key processes is viable. For this focus, it is essential to train a new generation of early-stage researchers in diverse multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial skills required. This, in a few words, is the aim of FLUXIONIC network, which spans four European countries and brings together Europe’s (and world’s) leading scientists and entrepreneurs. Precisely because the topic of FLUXIONIC bridges Physics, Chemistry and Materials science, and necessitates close collaboration with emerging nanoscale industries, our major objective is to offer integrated supra-disciplinary training and a strong program of secondments with seamless cross-sectoral interactions. The DN program provides an ideal framework for creating such collaborative research/training platform. The impact of FLUXIONIC will be broad. We will train young researchers with unique and diverse profiles, who might become future leaders in the rapidly growing fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Our research will
impact core challenges of modern society: clean water, disease treatment, sustainable energy production/storage/usage.

QUantum reservoir cOmputing based on eNgineered DEfect NetworkS in trAnsition meTal dichalcogEnides,"Today’s computation, based on parallel processing of information, is reaching its physical limitations and novel solutions are to be found in the close future to overcome such major hurdle. This project aims to achieve the first proof-of-concept of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) scheme based on networks of Quantum Materials (QMs) defects which will enable the fabrication of prototypical computing devices. The engineering of defect network characteristics such as density and defect typology will allow tailoring the defects’ network physical properties, and ultimately its neuromorphic and computing complexity. The project is feasible yet groundbreaking because it capitalizes upon the very different expertises, both experimental and theoretical, comprised within the partners’ consortium, all of which are required to implement a novel QRC scheme. As such, this project will result in unprecedented characteristics that extend the conventional boundaries of ICT electronic devices and systems and pave the way for the development of novel Quantum Technologies.",2896558,2024,2028,European Commission,Italy; Poland; Italy; Netherlands; Poland; Italy; France; Canada,EU,Engineering; Information and Computing Sciences; Quantum Physics
Challenging the limits of mechanical quantum metrology,"Nano- and micromechanical resonators, with their high coherence and low mass, serve as extremely good sensors of small forces and particles. They are especially powerful in combination with optical laser fields, which can measure mechanical motion down to the level where quantum mechanics is needed to describe it. The performance of mechanical quantum sensors, and in fact our ability to measure their displacement, is however limited by fundamental concepts: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle dictates the smallest vibration that can be resolved. And time-reversal symmetry bounds the measurement rate of a sensor. In this project, I challenge both limits – evading them by making nanomechanical resonators interact strongly with temporally controlled and nano-confined light fields. 
The experiments I propose will project a macroscopic mechanical object in a pure quantum state, through the mere act of performing a strong measurement. I aim to show that such measurements can entangle the object’s internal degrees of freedom, and can be used to boost metrology performance. By breaking time-reversal symmetry through optical control, I seek to enhance the sensitivity of mechanical force sensors. I will investigate whether the measurement interaction can be employed to coherently convert optical to mechanical states, and to manipulate optical signals down to the single-photon level.
The realization of these goals will radically advance mechanical quantum sensing, create coherent interfaces for quantum communication, and establish novel ways to control light and motion at the quantum level. Moreover, we will gain a new fundamental understanding of metrology and sensing performance in basic systems that transcend the mechanical domain. Finally, these foundational experiments will bring intriguing quantum effects in full view in ‘tangible’ objects, and test whether they can in fact exist at such macroscopic scales.",2879412,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Magnetic ENERGY conversion for waste HEAT,"The production and use of energy account for more than 75% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonising the EU’s energy system is therefore critical to reach our 2030 climate objectives and the EU’s long-term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Obviously solar and wind power will play an important role in any future energy scenario, but such intermittent sources present significant challenges in energy transport and storage. At the same time, a vast amount of low-grade heat is generated, e.g. in datacentres, food, pulp and paper industries, and is available 24/7. Even converting only a small percentage of this heat into electricity is significant due to the sheer amount of heat wasted just above ambient temperature. However, efficient technologies to convert this low-grade heat in an economically sound way are lacking Within this project, we will develop thermomagnetic harvesting from current TRL 3/4 proofs of principle to an efficient and cost competitive TRL 6/7 technology. Our interdisciplinary consortium of 9 academic institutes and 4 industrial partners address all major challenges for this emerging technology, which requires innovative designs of more efficient thermomagnetic generators, that are intimately connected with tailored thermomagnetic materials. Our team consists of engineers, who invented thermomagnetic systems at various sizes and power ranges, materials scientists with ample experience in advanced magnetic materials, bulk or film preparation and characterization, and physicists, who cover modelling from the ab initio scale, via micromagnetism at the mesoscale, up to the macroscopic device scale. This rich multidisciplinary environment will allow training of 10 young professionals by cross-fertilization with fresh ideas. They will obtain the interdisciplinary competence required to bring this green technology to a mature level, and career perspectives in both the academic and non-academic sectors delivering the Green Deal.",2878735,2024,2027,European Commission,Netherlands; Austria; Italy; Austria; Netherlands; France; Italy; Germany; Germany; France; Germany; Slovenia; Germany,EU,Engineering; Classical Physics
Tracing the FLUX of cosmic dust arriving to Earth during the Phanerozoic,"For the last 4.5 billion years, extraterrestrial (ET) materials have continuously bombarded the Earth. Today, the Solar System debris that reaches the Earth’s surface is dominated by particles less than 2 mm in size, termed micrometeorites (MMs). Until recently, the established misconception was that these MMs did not survive geological timescales, limiting reconstructions of the dust flux through time that are currently based on finding rare relict mineral phases or applying geochemical tools (e.g., Ir contents, 3He isotope ratios). Following a successful proof-of-concept study on a Late Devonian section, FLUX proposes first to extract fossil MMs from selected stratigraphic intervals across the Phanerozoic to document their characteristics and origin and second to use them as a novel high-resolution proxy to better understand the dynamical interactions between the Solar System and Earth. As such, fossil MMs may serve as an alternative new source of information on Solar System processes, complementary to classic meteorites. By combining expertise in meteoritics, geochemistry, and chemostratigraphy, FLUX addresses the following questions: 1) How did the flux of cosmic dust evolve during the Phanerozoic? 2) Can stratigraphic intervals marked by a dramatic increase in the mass of cosmic dust accreting to the Earth be identified? 3) Do increased ET flux events reflect asteroid family-forming events in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and are they influenced by changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit? 4) Can oxidized iron-rich MMs be used to reconstruct the gross primary productivity or atmospheric CO2 levels of the deep past? 5) Did ET flux fluctuations affect the global Earth environment, for example through ocean fertilization? Ultimately, FLUX will better position the Earth in the context of a dynamic Solar System and constrain the causes and consequences of the variations in the flux of cosmic dust to Earth.",2848019,2024,2029,ERC,Belgium,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Exploring the Deep Universe by Computational Analysis of Data from Observations,"The formation and evolution of massive galaxies is reasonably well understood in the context of the successful standard ΛCDM formalism. Such simulations of cosmic evolution, however, lead to serious challenges in the regime of the very faint galaxies, including the problems referred to as missing satellites, too big to fail, and planes of satellite galaxies. With the massive amounts of excellent data being produced by astronomical surveys, and with new missions scheduled to produce more data of even better quality, we have a unique chance to solve these problems. To do this, we require innovative developments in information technology. In EDUCADO (Exploring the Deep Universe by Computational Analysis of Data from Observations), an intensive collaboration at the intersection of astronomy and computer science, we bring together experts from different disciplines and sectors. We will train 10 Doctoral Candidates in the development of a variety of high-quality methods, needed to address the formation of the faintest structures.

Time-resolved sImulations of ultrafast phenoMena in quantum matErialS,"Emergent phenomena arising from excitation, correlation, and coherence of electrons, spin, photons and nuclei may open unexplored paths to exploit advanced quantum materials. Modelling and understanding ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics is the key to quantum computing, to new paradigms for information storage and retrieval, to novel opto-electronic devices for efficient light emission and renewable energy production, and to efficient single-photon quantum emitters. 
The TIMES doctoral network will merge different areas of expertise in many-body and time-dependent electronic structure methods to define a new paradigm for the atomistic modelling of nonequilibrium processes in condensed matter. This is an area where the theoretical state-of-the-art is lacking in predictive power. On one hand modeling crucial dynamical processes such as the ones involving energy exchange between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom out-of-equilibrium remains out of reach for current first-principles approaches. On the other hand, phenomenological and second-principles models lack the granularity required to quantitatively capture the evolution of complex materials.

stimulated by ultrafast laser pulses for the understanding of complex quantum states and emergent phenomena in a diverse range of
functional materials like perovskites, 2D materials, Weyl semimetals, Dirac materials and topological insulators. For this purpose,

QUANTUM-ENHANCED BENCHTOP NMR SPECTROMETER,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the workhorse of modern molecular structural analysis with countless scientific applications, from materials science to drug discovery. Nevertheless, even the most modern NMR spectrometers still employ the same principles as 80 years ago, induction coils and high magnetic fields, making them bulky, expensive, and inaccessible to many potential users. However, a novel type of NMR sensor emerged recently from solid-state spin quantum systems: the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which has demonstrated unparalleled sensitivities in detecting NMR signals. In this proposal, we aim to significantly enhance the sensitivity of modern benchtop NMR spectrometers by several orders of magnitude. We will achieve this improvement by combining the NMR technology field with cutting-edge quantum sensing, employing improved NV-diamond materials, advanced microwave antennas, novel pulse sequences, and quantum control protocols. The goal is to achieve complete control and protection from the environmental noise of the NV-spin state, incorporating quantum memories and logical operations to reach radiofrequency sensitivities well beyond those of classical NMR sensors.

(2XPLO2D) Exploring 2D materials and their van der Waals assemblies,"Research on two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals assemblies has expanded dramatically reaching beyond condensed matter physics and materials science, into such distant disciplines as life sciences and particle physics. Despite being relatively mature, the field shows no sign of withering. Even graphene, the most extensively studied 2D crystal, regularly reincarnates itself and, somewhat surprisingly, delivers breakthroughs every few years. For example, a wealth of new phenomena has recently been found in graphene superlattices whereas magic-angle twisted graphene has been celebrated for revealing exotic superconductivity and strongly correlated states. Devices made from high-quality graphene also provide fertile grounds for uncovering new low-dimensional and many-body physics.
The applicant has been involved in 2D materials research from the very beginning. Over the last decade, his group has continued to report high-profile results and even initiated several new subfields including graphene superlattices, electron hydrodynamics, water and ion permeation through graphene oxide laminates, molecular transport through angstrom-scale 2D capillaries and proton transport through monolayer crystals.
Based on the latest experiments and technological advances in the applicant's group, this proposal aims to explore the field of 2D materials further by pushing its boundaries on several fronts. Some of the proposed directions such as, for example, studies of the Planckian Dirac plasma are practically guaranteed to bring surprises and possibly germinate new subfields, while other directions (e.g., exponentially selective 2D membranes) are more adventurous. The unifying goal of all the proposed directions is to explore opportunities that remain abundant within the field of 2D materials and their assemblies, trying to find something new, exciting and potentially useful.",2751924,2025,2030,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics

Mining the Archaeological Record in Galaxy Outskirts,"The low surface brightness peripheral regions of galaxies contain a gold mine of information about their assembly histories, reflecting how minor mergers and accretions have influenced their evolution over cosmic time. Enormous stellar envelopes and copious amounts of faint tidal debris are natural outcomes of the hierarchical assembly process - the quantitative study of these features, while extremely challenging, offers tremendous potential for gaining insight into the detailed histories of galaxies.

I have played a leading role in groundbreaking work that helped to establish and develop this line of research but shortcomings in the previously available datasets (e.g. sample size, surface brightness depth), and the often-disjoint analyses of observations and numerical simulations, have thus far limited the conclusions that can be drawn. My exceptionally timely project MARGO will use state-of-the-art data from world-leading facilities and the forthcoming Euclid and LSST surveys to accurately determine the properties of the faint outskirts of galaxies throughout the local Universe and use them as a new tool to rigorously test the current galaxy formation paradigm.

The approach of MARGO is three-pronged, combining precision analyses of the resolved stellar populations in the halos of the nearest systems beyond the Local Group with unbiased integrated light studies of tidal debris in large statistical samples. Fossil information about past accretion events in galaxy peripheries will be extracted and compared to cosmological simulations of structure formation to stress test their predictions on small scales. Critical to the success of the project is the development of a new methodology to detect faint tidal features in large galaxy samples using machine learning., MARGO will transform our understanding of low surface brightness galaxy outskirts and finally enable us to place the particular history of our own Milky Way in context.",2740514,2025,2030,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Space Sciences
MOde LOcKing for Advanced Sensing and Imaging),"The optical frequency comb is a spectrum of evenly spaced narrow laser lines. Optical frequency combs have revolutionized time and frequency metrology by linking microwave and optical frequencies. However, realizing their full potential in a broader range of applications such as 3D imaging, environmental sensing, LIDAR, and high-speed optical communications, is conditioned by the availability of inexpensive highly miniaturized devices.
Progress in integrated optics towards chip-scale frequency combs has made significant strides in recent years. UGent has been at the forefront of this evolution. It has developed unique technologies in heterogeneous integration, enabling the long-missing functionality of optical gain on a chip. This unlocks the full integration of combs, in particular, in the infrared, but also in the near-infrared range (800-1100 nm), the key to sensing in water-dominated media as encountered in biological samples, e.g., in optical coherence tomography setting, food industry, and environmental sensing.
In MOLOKAI UGent will engage in a close collaboration with the group at MBI which is the pioneer of the applications of frequency combs applied to dual-comb interferometry and, in particular, the initiator of the extension of frequency-comb techniques to 3D imaging, and to Raman spectroscopy. In this way in MOLOKAI, we aim to leverage the latest breakthroughs in chip-scale frequency-comb technology to transition these technologies in a real-life setting.
MOLOKAI will work further on our initial dual-comb results to make a broadband on-chip interferometer. For that, MOLOKAI will collaborate closely with IBSEN Photonics, a spectrometer company, to make high-resolution spectrometers that can be used to read out Bragg sensors in fibers.

Equipment: MRI: Track 2 - Development of an ultra-high precision wavelength-calibration system for the Large Binocular Telescope,"Scientists detect exoplanets by using spectrographs that measure tiny changes in the color of starlight caused by stars wobbling back and forth as planets orbit around them. In 1995 this method was used to detect the first exoplanet in orbit around a star like the Sun, a breakthrough recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019. Finding even smaller exoplanets in the future, including those like Earth, requires careful calibration of the spectrographs that make these measurements. With funds from NSF’s Major Research Instrumentation program, this team will procure, install, and optimize a new “laser frequency comb” calibration source for two spectrographs at the 8.4-meter Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. In addition, this project will contribute to training the next generation of scientists and engineers, and graduate students will lead key program elements while being mentored by senior members of the team in training and career development. High resolution spectroscopic measurements will play an essential role in exoplanet science. In addition to supporting transit surveys, the radial velocity (RV) method will also play a critical role in the characterization of planets discovered by future direct imaging missions. To accomplish these goals it is crtical that we continue to advance the sensitivity, resolution, and precision of extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) spectrographs. This project will deliver a state-of-the-art Laser Frequency Comb (LFC) to the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and complete its optimized integration, enabling critical multi-year spectroscopic studies with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) and iLocater spectrograph. With their precision high-resolution (R>190,000) capabilities spanning visible (PEPSI: 383-912nm) and near-infrared (iLocater: 970-1310nm) wavelengths on a dual 8.4m telescope, these instruments are optimized for EPRV studies of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics. Augmenting them with a dedicated LFC with its absolute wavelength calibration capabilities enables robust intercalibration between LBT instruments and expands short-term instrument performance to multi-year baselines.

Waves for energy in magnetized plasmas,"The interplay between energetic particles and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) fluctuations plays a paramount role in a modern society with growing energy demands and active interaction with the space weather. The prediction of space weather and viability of fusion as a virtually unlimited source of energy rely on a good understanding of fundamental wave-particle interactions. Although the sources of energetic particles are quite different for space, astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, the main challenges remain the same: 3D multi-scale physics and non-linear wave-particle interactions. 

In the framework of SMARTWAVES, a potentially revolutionary plasma regime for future burning fusion plasma devices with tailored MHD activity will be developed. Novel diagnostic techniques to monitor the temporal evolution of the energetic ion distribution in phase-space will allow the identification of the fundamental wave-particle resonances responsible for the experimental observations. Combined with the next generation of electron fluctuations diagnostics, I will provide a complete physics basis of currently inaccessible wave phenomena. This will pave the way towards a high-confinement plasma regime that closes the burning plasma performance and exhaust gap, simultaneously maximizing the fusion gain and minimizing the plasma-wall interaction. Advanced 3D non-linear codes validated in tokamak plasmas will be applied to relevant solar events paving the way to a space weather forecast station.

In the last few years I have co-pioneered and developed their hydrodynamic theory, dubbed generalised hydrodynamics. It is one of the most successful non-conventional hydrodynamic theory, and finds many applications, from soliton gas to models of statistical mechanics, quantum chains and cold atomic quantum gases, with stunning experimental verifications. The development of GHD required us to focus on the general structures of hydrodynamics, leading us to propose new general methods to understand physical quantities at the largest scales of space and time, including fluctuations, correlations, and ``structured behaviours"" such as many-body oscillations. This calls for a re-think of what the universal principles of hydrodynamics are. Can we describe non-equilibrium motion, fluctuations, correlations and structured behaviours in many-body systems from hydrodynamic principles? Can these be derived from microscopic models? Do they form a basis for the emergent laws of many-body physics, from large to small scales? GHD gives partial answers and a clear way forward, but much is still open. This project will attempt to answer these questions, using GHD and integrability as powerful tools for physically relevant systems and exact calculations. This will require varied skills and expertises. My track record of directing successful research teams, combined with my world-leading expertise on generalised hydrodynamics and emergent behaviours, places me perfectly to lead this groundbreaking project.",2708578,2025,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Explaining Common Envelope Evolution and Dynamics in binary stellar systems,"A thorough understanding of stellar evolution is key to nearly any branch of astrophysics. The majority of stars evolves in binary or multiple systems and interactions often occur between their components. Such dynamical interaction phases are pivotal for the fate of the system and its constituents, but they elude classical stellar modeling. Common-envelope phases, in which a compact companion spirals into the envelope of a giant primary star, are the glaring gaps in our knowledge and pose one of the last unsolved fundamental problems to stellar astrophysics.

The ExCEED project breaks new ground by developing a strategy to reach a comprehensive understanding of common-envelope evolution. It combines leading three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic moving-mesh simulations with innovative models of physical processes to decipher the dynamical interaction between the stellar cores and the envelope material. On this basis, the post-common envelope evolution is explored by consistently linking to classical one-dimensional models. Predictions for astronomical observables are derived and a faithful effective prescription for representing common-envelope phases in binary stellar evolution and population synthesis calculations is constructed.

The new understanding of common-envelope evolution provided by the ExCEED project marks a break- through in stellar astrophysics and has implications beyond this field. ExCEED finally settles the long- standing questions of the mechanism of envelope ejection and the orbital separation of the post-common envelope remnant binary system. This allows to understand the formation of the targets of gravitational- wave astronomy that holds promise to solve problems of fundamental physics, the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, and many other astrophysical events.",2706214,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Quantum Interactions in Photon-Induced Nearfield Electron Microscopy,"Breakthroughs in electron microscopy over the past 15 years have introduced femtosecond laser-driven electron microscopes that probe matter and even hybrid light-matter polaritons with ultrafast time resolution. However, such systems still mostly extract classical properties of light and matter. This project will pursue the next frontier – extract quantum properties of light and matter, such as correlations and entanglement. We will develop a new concept of laser-driven electron interferometry for the goal of creating and measuring quantum correlations in the ultrafast regime.

Over the past 4 years, my group has shown how free electrons can interact coherently with light in photonic cavities and even get imprinted by the quantum photon statistics of light. Leveraging such interactions enabled us and other groups to develop theories and experiments for controlling the wave nature of individual electrons, creating coherently modulated electron wavepackets.

Here we will harness such coherent electron modulation to develop new microscopy modalities that can reveal important quantum properties of light, matter, and their interactions: We are going to make the first observation of quantum nonlinear optical dynamics of polaritons in 2D materials, to measure the quantum state dynamics in superradiant quantum dot ensembles, and to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of correlated matter, such as the creation and annihilation of vortices in superconductors.

Toward this goal, we will develop a unique ultrafast free-electron interferometer operating at cryogenic temperatures. Exploiting the quantum electron-photon interaction in this system can create unprecedented many-electron entangled states that break classical limits in electron microscopy. Specially designed photonic cavities will amplify the entanglement and promote electron microscopy as a novel platform for fundamental studies of quantum information science.",2706212,2025,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Precision Rayleigh jet sprays,"Sprays have a wide range of applications, from cleaning to agriculture to medical treatments. Spray technologies are key to many industrial processes, yet many current spray technologies suffer from insufficient control over the resulting spray parameters, such as the droplet size distribution, even though the drop size critically determines whether a spray reaches its target or not in applications such as pharmaceutical drug inhalation and agricultural spraying. As trial-and-error spray development methods are reaching their limits, we need a new breakthrough to enable perfectly monodisperse sprays. 

I have previously shown that insights into the physics of sprays can lead to improved spraying and deposition methods. For agricultural sprays I achieved the first detailed understanding of the strongly non-equilibrium processes that underlie spray formation, allowing for a quantitative description of the drop size distribution in these sprays. These insights pave the way to improving our understanding of sprays in general and translating it into a new generation of spray nozzles that produce highly controlled droplet size distributions as urgently needed by a range of applications. The scientific challenge is to identify the complex nonequilibrium physics underlying liquid breakup and use these insights to devise entirely novel ways of controlling instabilities to achieve perfectly monodisperse sprays. 

We will combine breakthroughs in hydrodynamics to ‘tame’ the instabilities responsible for spray formation, using selective excitation of instability modes combined with novel nanofabrication methods for spray nozzles. In addition, we will study drop coalescence and droplet trajectories in air. We will elucidate spray mechanisms allowing for monodisperse sprays, and explore the role of liquid composition in complex sprays. These fundamental breakthroughs will be tested in precision medicine and agriculture, two of the most important fields of spray use.",2706212,2025,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Engineering; Classical Physics
A Statistical Mechanics Framework for Immiscible Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media,"The flow of immiscible fluids in porous media is at the heart of a wide range of applications, some of which are central to humanity. Oil recovery has traditionally had such a role, but more recently, aquifer replenishment to maintain water supplies has become a field of increasing worldwide importance.

Immiscible multiphase flow in porous media is a problem in hydrodynamics of extraordinary complexity.  Not only does one have the intricacies of moving fluid interfaces, but the flow occurs within a pore space having a highly contorted geometry. 
 
Porous media typically span orders of magnitude in length scales: The pore scale may be in the micrometer range or less whereas the macroscopic scale may be in the kilometer range.  Is there a way to find a description of the flow at these large scales from a knowledge of how the fluids behave at the pore scale?
 
My claim is that there is. Statistical mechanics, which has been used to derive thermodynamics from the motion of molecules, can be reformulated to do the same for immiscible multiphase flow in porous media.  This sounds like an impossible task as statistical mechanics demands equilibrium whereas the flow problem is driven.  The approach I propose is based on information theory and hydrodynamics.

My objective is to develop a complete theory for immiscible multiphase flow in porous media at large scales based on a reformulation of statistical mechanics that encompasses the pore scale physics and which is simple enough to be useful in practical engineering applications.

This will allow me to reproduce accurately the formation of viscous fingers when a less viscous fluid invades a more viscous fluid.  This is a problem as important in field-scale modelling as it is difficult.   
   
This will be the first time a statistical mechanics framework for non-thermal, non-equilibrium systems has been developed.  This has interest far beyond the realm of porous media.",2706212,2025,2029,ERC,Norway,EU,Earth Sciences; Hydrology; Engineering; Environmental Sciences; Classical Physics
High Resolution Laser Spectroscopy of Atomic Hydrogen and Deuterium,"Discrepancies between theory and experiments have been fueling the development of physics. Today, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the most accurate theory and served as a blueprint for all subsequent field theories. Physics beyond the Standard Model must exist as we know from observations of the cosmos. It is likely to be found where no one has looked before, i.e., at very large energies, high sensitivity, or high precision. To progress with the so-called precision frontier, high resolution spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and hydrogen-like systems continues to play a decisive role because their simplicity. Testing QED means to verify the consistency of parameters that enter this theory as they are obtained from as many different measurements as possible. Spectroscopic data also provides the input for the determination of the best values for the fundamental constants. The largest leverage for the determination of the Rydberg constant is currently due to the 1S-3S transition frequency that we want to improve in the framework of this proposal. A second apparatus provides a cold metastable 2S beam of atomic hydrogen and deuterium. This will be used in a series of measurements between the 2S and nP states as well as two-photon transitions between 2S and nS/nD states (with n=3…10). The same apparatus can be used to remeasure the 1S-2S transition frequency as an improved result from anti-hydrogen is expected. The work with the spectrometers builds on proven technologies. To go further we are proposing a method to trap atomic hydrogen in an optical dipole trap that operates at the magic wavelength. The proposed scheme avoids a cooling laser and will not be more complex than existing optical lattice clocks. It could eliminate all leading systematics for the above-mentioned transitions. Moreover, it could be employed as a computable clock to redefine the SI by fixing the value of the Rydberg constant. The new SI system would then be based exclusively on defined constants.",2706211,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators"
Ball-Milling Mechanochemistry at the Molecular Level-2,"Ball milling mechanochemistry is receiving tremendous attention over the last years. The applicant has pioneered the use of it for effecting catalytic reactions, culminating in catalytic ammonia synthesis from H2 and N2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In spite of the success in driving reactions mechanically, the molecular level understanding of the key processes under mechanical activation is still in its infancy. The proposed program will change this, using methods giving insight at the atomic scale. By a multi-pronged approach, the applicant – partly in collaborations - will experimentally probe at the atomic scale hypotheses, which have been put forward to explain the special effects of mechanochemical reactions, to provide key elements for a conceptual understanding. 
Three topical areas will be covered, in addition, one general purpose tool for the study of mechanochemical reactions will be developed. (1) Temperature dependent luminescence will be used to monitor temperatures during model impacts in order to probe the hot spot and magma/plasma hypotheses. (2) The role of hypothetical, short-lived, mechanically induced defects in catalysis will be analyzed locally at the atomic scale in scanning probe microscopes. (3) In order to understand mechanically induced phase transitions, mechanical forces will be applied in-situ to precursor crystals in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), and phase transitions, for instance from boehmite to corundum, will be followed at the atomic scale by TEM imaging. (4) As a general tool to study the influence of mechanical forces, a hammer/anvil system will be developed in which directly after applying mechanical force the system can be studied by various analytical methods. Overall, the program is expected to provide deep mechanistic understanding of different aspects of mechanochemistry to advance it to a next level.",2706211,2024,2029,ERC,Germany; Austria,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Manipulating magnetic domains through femtosecond pulses of magnetic field,"While the electronic industry has successfully entered the nanoworld following Moore’s law, the speed of manipulating and storing data lags behind, creating the so-called ultrafast technology gap. Processors already have a clock speed of a few gigahertz, while the storage on a magnetic hard disk requires a few nanoseconds. This bottleneck can also be found in magnetic random access memory devices. 
The use of ultrafast pulses of light has demonstrated effectiveness in manipulating magnetic orders on very short time scales. However, the physical processes involved are still poorly understood, and such a control reaches the micrometer scale at best, effectively preventing their use for high-density data storage.
FemtoMagnet aims to develop an entirely new approach to manipulating magnetic domains based on the engineering of plasmonic nanodevices. For that, these devices will optically generate ultra-short, intense, and reversible pulses of magnetic field at the nanoscale, a challenge that no other technique can achieve so far. 
To meet its ambitious goals, my research program engineers innovative plasmonic nanostructures inversely-designed to tailor light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Under the right illumination conditions, the electromagnetic fields generated by the nanostructure set the electrons in a metal (such as in a coil) in pseudo-continuous drift motion, in turn yielding the creation of a strong stationary magnetic field.
By specifically creating and manipulating ultrafast, strong, confined and reversible pulses of magnetic field in an all-optical fashion, my research program will enable the manipulation of magnetic domains at the nanoscale and over very short timescales (a few tens of femtoseconds), opening the way to applications in ultrafast data storage and data processing.",2706132,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Strongly Enhanced Sensitivity EPR through Bimodal Resonators and Quantum-Limited Amplifiers,"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a powerful tool employed across various disciplines including structural biology, chemistry, physics, material science, and many others. It provides important and unique information on a local electron spin environment, electronic properties and dynamics of various paramagnetic centers. However, a relatively low sensitivity of this method often limits the range and type of systems that can be studied. Thus, major advancements in EPR sensitivity are crucial to significantly broaden its applicability, encompassing new and highly relevant systems such as single cells.
The Strongly Enhanced Sensitivity EPR through Bimodal Resonators and Quantum-Limited Amplifiers (Strong-ESPRESSO) project will ignite a revolution in EPR by employing sophisticated bimodal microwave resonators and intricate ways of noise reduction in tandem with novel microwave amplifiers developed for quantum technologies. We will achieve this by first delivering a new generation of EPR cryoprobeheads, which will utilize the orthogonal-field bimodal cavities, allowing to reach the sensitivity limit of these instruments. Secondly, we will transfer the bimodal cavity concept to planar superconducting microresonators, enabling the employment of these tools to study tiny (pL volume) samples of typical fast-decohering spin systems (e.g. protein droplets). Finally, we will develop an ultra-sensitive EPR setup based on the radiative cooling effect of the bimodal resonators and recent advances in the quantum-limited microwave amplifiers. This revolutionary new setup is expected to provide a ground-breaking 5000x reduction in the EPR measurement time, simultaneously preserving compatibility with ordinary EPR experiments and samples. Throughout the project, we will immediately apply the developed tools to study new and intricate spin systems in the fields of catalysis, protein droplets, and single cells, leading to major impacts far beyond EPR.",2706132,2025,2030,ERC,Lithuania,EU,Quantum Physics

Search for physics beyond the standard model with highly charged ions,"Spectroscopy has been a central tool in modern physics: it has helped us understand atomic structure, the expansion of the universe and the composition of exoplanet atmospheres. Today, high-precision spectroscopy is one of the most promising tools for investigating some of the most fundamental open questions: many theories beyond the standard model of particle physics can be tested by detecting tiny changes in atomic transition frequencies caused by the interaction with new particles, new forces or the variation of fundamental constants. 
An especially attractive target is the search for temporal or spatial variations of the fine-structure constant, which is predicted by several different theories. Highly-charged ions (HCIs) are especially well suited for this search, as they have transitions that are over an order of magnitude more sensitive to the fine structure constant than most other atomic systems. The precision necessary for these measurements will soon be within reach, thanks to recent demonstrations of sympathetic cooling and quantum-logic spectroscopy of HCIs.
I propose an experiment that simultaneously probes two of the most sensitive transitions in HCIs using quantum logic spectroscopy and directly compares their transition frequencies. This method doubles the advantage of their enhanced sensitivities and reduces systematic effects introduced by an indirect comparison via the SI second standard. Together, these gains will allow an improvement of over two orders of magnitude on current bounds on the temporal variation of the fine-structure constant.
I will also take advantage of the exotic nature of these extreme atoms to test further theories of fundamental physics. In particular, I plan to exploit their enhanced Rutherford scattering cross section to determine an improved limit on the number density of proposed millicharged dark matter particles.
This data will help narrow down the most viable theories for physics beyond the standard model.",2706011,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Leap in Advancing of crItical Quantum key distribution-spAce components,"LaiQa comes as a technology intensive research and innovation action aiming to develop and advance critical components and technologies necessary to build a global spaced-based quantum network.

antiProtonic Atom X-ray spectroscopy,"Numerous experimental observations have shown that the Standard Model is not complete. Precision measurements in quantum systems are one of the privileged frontiers for searching for new physics, as new particles may couple to atoms, provoking tiny changes in atomic structure that can be measured with state-of-the-art methods. Such searches are founded on an accurate understanding of quantum electrodynamics (QED), the field theory that describes the interaction between light and charged particles. While QED is well understood for light systems like the hydrogen atom where agreement between theory and experiment have been achieved up to third-order interactions with the quantum vacuum, for high-Z atoms in the strong Coulomb field regime, the theory remains untested beyond first-order interactions. This is due to both experimental complications, and theoretical uncertainties linked to unknown nuclear properties.  

I propose a new approach for testing strong-field QED via the x-ray spectroscopy of antiprotonic atoms. In these systems, orders of magnitude higher Coulomb fields can be obtained, acting like a magnifying glass for QED effects that become easier to measure. Using transitions between Rydberg states, uncertainties from nuclear properties can be avoided and two orders of magnitude sensitivity can be gained with respect to the best current experiments, making testing strong-field QED finally possible for a broad range of atomic species.

The realization of this project relies on the novel combination of two new technologies: slow antiproton beams at CERN, and quantum sensing x-ray detectors. The compatibility of these two requires new developments that will lead to a dedicated precision x-ray spectroscopy platform for antiprotonic atoms, with transverse applications beyond QED in nuclear and new physics searches.",2705780,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Quantum Physics"
Isolating Many-Particle Correlations in Time and Space,"Electronic excitations are crucial in many fields of science and engineering. Time-resolved spectroscopy is widely used to detect dynamics of excited particles (electrons) and quasiparticles (e.g., excitons or plasmons). In the scheme of “femtochemistry” established since decades, one excitation is placed into the system by a pump pulse and its evolution observed by a time-delayed probe pulse. However, this does not resolve correlations between multiple excitations making it impossible to understand important quantum phenomena.

We shall develop and apply new experimental methods to determine multi-particle correlations, based on isolating higher (than fourth) orders of perturbation theory systematically. We will separate these contributions without requiring a-priori models. With tailored femtosecond laser pulse sequences, we circumvent the stochastic nature of light–matter interaction even though we use only classical light and retrieve information from specific orders of a perturbative expansion, hitherto only accessible theoretically.

We also consider that many materials are heterogeneous. Thus, we isolate multi-particle correlations in space by combining high nonlinear orders with fluorescence microscopy and photoemission electron microscopy. This enables us to avoid ensemble averaging and obtain information for specific domains down to the single-molecule limit.

Our methods will be applied to determine exciton diffusion in organic materials, chiral excitonic couplings, plexciton–plexciton interactions, quantum coherence in multi-exciton generation, phonon–phonon couplings in quantum dots, and the role of dark states in correlated materials.

We expect IMPACTS to change how complex systems are studied with ultrafast spectroscopy. Overcoming limitations of single-particle models, we seek a holistic picture of correlated dynamics, impacting our understanding and application of solar energy conversion, transport in functional materials, and quantum technologies.",2705631,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Quantum Physics
Holography in the Gravitational Wave Era,"The revolution unleashed by the discovery of gravitational waves will gradually unfold over the coming decades. The detection of a neutron star merger by LIGO and Virgo opened a new era in multi-messenger astronomy. Future ground-based interferometers, such as the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, will extend the range of detection to the entire Universe, and the frequency to millions of detections per year.  Space-based missions like LISA may discover gravitational waves from phase transitions in the early Universe. 

Reaping the benefits of this experimental revolution requires a theoretical understanding of quantum matter coupled to dynamical classical gravity. The fact that the relevant physics is often out-of-equilibrium and/or strongly coupled makes this a challenging regime for conventional approaches. The purpose of this project is to use holography, also known as gauge/string duality, to make essential contributions in this direction. I have recently pioneered and provided proof of concept that this line of research is both powerful and feasible. In the next five years I will turn these initial investigations into a fully-fledged research program to improve our understanding of: (i) Cosmological phase transitions, in particular of bubble dynamics and baryogenesis; (ii) Neutron stars, with a focus on out-of-equilibrium physics in binary mergers; (iii) Spacetime singularities, specifically in the presence of quantum matter effects. 

These three main objectives are interconnected by two horizontal lines: (i) Identification of universal observables, which hold the best potential to make contact with experiment;  (ii) Communication with other fields, which is crucial for the success of an interdisciplinary proposal.",2705616,2025,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences; Particle and High Energy Physics
Gas flows in and out of galaxies: solving the cosmic baryon cycle,"Galaxy formation is driven by the flows of gas in and out of galaxies, which remain poorly understood. Galaxies grow and fuel their star formation through the accretion of new gas, while stellar and AGN activities eject copious amount of gas into the environment. The physics of and interplay between these phenomena (cosmic baryon cycle) are extremely complex, with the consequence that our current understanding of how and when gas flows take place and their impact on the life-cycle of galaxies is still patchy.

Hence, the FLOWS ERC project is designed to precisely determine the properties of gas flows in and out of galaxies across cosmic time and explain their role in galaxy formation and evolution. With FLOWS, we will conclusively determine how gas accretion from the environment takes place and how it changes with time. We will accurately measure the properties of galactic winds and fountains and establish their role in regulating the gas content of galaxies. We will build the next generation of predictive galaxy evolution models that will include, for the first time, fully constrained gas flows.

FLOWS will achieve these ambitious goals thanks to a unique and powerful combination of innovative data analysis and theoretical investigations. My team will study gas flows in and around galaxies using the full range of state-of-the-art data coming from ALMA, the SKA pathfinders, the VLT, the HST and JWST.

Most importantly, we will design new analysis techniques, including the first 3D code to model galactic winds directly in datacubes. Ground-breaking theoretical methods will allow us to combine the benefits of large-scale models with high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. This multifaceted approach, which is the key to crack the baryon cycle problem, derives its strength from the diverse research lines that I have pursued in the past years, which puts me in a unique position worldwide to the make the major leap forward that FLOWS promises to achieve.",2705592,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Highly Ionized Trapped 229-Thorium:A New Paradigm Towards a Nuclear Clock,"""Among the more than 3000 nuclides that are naturally occurring or that have been artificially synthesized, thorium-229 is truly exceptional. Its remarkably low excitation energy makes it the ideal candidate for nuclear frequency metrology, surpassing current atomic clocks. Such a """"nuclear clock"""" opens doors to fundamental physics, testing time-variations of constants and exploring the enigma of dark matter. 
Within HITHOR a conceptually novel methodology towards such a clock is proposed, eventually leading to a no-electron “bare-nucleus” clock with trapped fully ionized 229Th90+ where all external perturbations from surrounding electrons are absent. Highly-ionized 229Th will be established as a distinctive laboratory for scientific explorations at the interface of atomic electrons and the nucleus. 
By adding a single electron to the nucleus, the unique effect of nuclear hyperfine mixing (NHM) is unlocked. Induced by the strong magnetic field of this one electron, a vast acceleration of the nuclear decay by up to a millionfold is triggered. Hence, for one-electron 229Th89+ laser excitation of the nucleus as well as the reemission of photons are each enhanced by up to this factor of a million. To date, laser excitation of the nucleus hasn’t been accomplished. NHM will help to overcome this obstacle and exploited as a booster towards 229Th laser excitation and a corresponding nuclear clock. 
HITHOR will be realized at the ion storage and trapping facilities at GSI in Darmstadt, the only laboratory worldwide where highly ionized 229Th can be synthesized in flight, decelerated, and finally trapped at rest. At GSI and its Helmholtz Institute Jena, I will bring together the extraordinary expertise of in-house scientists from the various disciplines required to tackle the challenges. Initial experiments will pave the path towards high-precision VUV laser spectroscopy of few- or no-electron 229Th, and ultimately towards a single-ion quantum logic nuclear clock.""",2705096,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Quantum Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Imaging The Topological Defects of Light-Induced Phases in Quantum Materials,"Quantum materials host many exotic and useful phases, and harnessing these states has spurred tremendous research effort. However, the full potential of quantum materials lies in the rich landscape of higher-energy hidden phases, those which are not thermally accessible. Ultrafast laser excitation has recently emerged as a way access these hidden phases, leading to the idea of re-writing material properties “on demand”, but these states usually only survive for hundreds of picoseconds. Thus a key outstanding question remains: how can we stabilize light-induced phases? 

One key mechanism which can stabilize a phase is topology. The ultrafast phase transitions induced by femtosecond laser pulses naturally lead to the generation of topological defects. These defects, which can only relax after propagating until they encounter another topological defect, could either offer a route to stabilizing light-induced phases or impede their formation, and have been invoked in both contexts to explain many observations. However, actually imaging these nanometer scale defects on the femtosecond to nanosecond timescales required for light-induced phases has not been possible, and so the role of topological defects in light-induced phases remains unclear.

In KnotSeen I will perform the first real space imaging of topological defects in light-induced phases using coherent XUV imaging methods, which provide the necessary spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution to map topological defects at the nanoscale and out of equilibrium. I will map the creation, propagation, and destruction of topological defects in two important cases: quenched superconductivity in the cuprates and light-induced phases in the manganites. A novel data analysis approach will be used to distinguish repeatable from stochastic dynamics at the nanoscale. KnotSeen will reveal the mechanisms by which topological defects control light-induced phases, enabling new tools to stabilize and selectively control them.",2705082,2025,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Past Solar Storms: The links between solar storms and solar activity,"Our Sun is a remarkably stable energy source which is crucial for life on Earth. However, we know that the Sun exhibits variations on a wide range of time scales. Occasionally, violent eruptions on the Sun’s surface, so-called solar storms, release energetic particles that can damage our modern society. Nowadays the Sun is constantly monitored and a wealth of information has been obtained about its variability from ground-based and satellite observations. However, our Sun exhibits variations that exceed the range measured during the space era as evidenced from sunspot observations over the past 400 years. Similarly, as demonstrated by historical observations and indirect proxy data, the Sun can produce solar storms orders of magnitudes larger than anything observed during the space era. Presently, we do not know the recurrence rate of large solar storms and how these are linked to solar activity. Mapping out the linkages may help to understand underlying processes and to predict the risks for future events.

To achieve this we can take advantage of the “natural detector” of past solar activity – cosmogenic radionuclides in highly resolved and well-dated natural archives. I am proposing to develop this natural cosmic ray detector to increase its detection limit, resolution and reliability for assessing solar storms and solar variability in the past. This involves an assessment of the complete chain from solar energetic particles to cosmogenic radionuclide deposition for ground-truthing of the natural cosmic ray detector. Furthermore, novel ice core sampling and improved analytical methods will allow us to produce an unprecedented database for these studies. We will test hypotheses of the recurrence rate of solar storms and their relationship to solar activity. Our results will extend space weather research to millennial time scales and lead to a ground breaking new understanding of the temporal variability of our star.",2704941,2024,2029,ERC,Sweden,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Hyperfine coupled spins with time evolution readout,"Quantum simulation is a promising strategy for understanding the behaviour of quantum systems that are too complex to be calculated directly. HYPSTER will make crucial steps towards creating a quantum simulator from individual magnetic atoms, addressed by means of a scanning tunnelling microscope. I will engineer atomic structures combining electron and nuclear spins – coupled to each other via hyperfine interaction – and read out their collective quantum coherent evolution in real time.

The lifetime of any quantum state is limited by its coherence time. While electron spins on a surface suffer from continuous decoherence due to electrons from the substrate, nuclear spins are much better isolated, holding potential for orders of magnitude longer coherence times. By providing controlled access to the real-time dynamics of the nuclear spin, HYPSTER aims to unlock this invaluable potential. 

First, expanding upon a unique measurement procedure developed in my group, I will trace the combined time evolution of a nuclear spin coupled to an electron spin, allowing quantum information to be exchanged between the two. Next, I will explore methods to controllably couple and decouple the nuclear and electron spins by rapidly adjusting the local Hamiltonian. This will allow the nuclear spin to evolve by itself, not hindered by external decoherence sources. Finally, I will employ dual-frequency electron spin resonance to enable remote detection of spin dynamics, constructing a pathway towards connecting multiple nuclear spins over a distance.

The objectives of HYPSTER will provide a toolset that can be readily adopted throughout the blooming field of on-surface spin systems and set the stage for true atomic-scale quantum simulation.",2704847,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Realizing designer quantum matter in van der Waals heterostructures,"Conventional materials hosting exotic quantum phases typically have complex atomic structures, inhomogeneities from defects, impurities, and dopants making it difficult to rationally engineer their electronic properties. This can be overcome using van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures that allow an almost arbitrary selection of the heterostructure building blocks, including metals and insulators, charge-density wave systems, superconductors, magnets, correlated insulators, and ferroelectrics. In a vdW heterostructure, the layers interact only through vdW forces and can keep their intrinsic properties. However, proximity effects cause properties to “leak” between the adjacent layers and allow creating exotic quantum mechanical phases that arise from the interactions between the layers. These key features have recently made it possible to realize exotic quantum phases by design and engineer responses that do not occur in natural materials. I will now exploit these features and fabricate heterostructures using molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) to target artificial heavy fermion heterostructures realizing unconventional superconductivity, artificial 2D multiferroic materials, and 2D quantum spin liquids. The atomic scale geometry and electronic properties of the resulting heterostructures will be characterized using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS).

These designer heterostructures will have engineered electronic phenomena with atomically precise structures and controlled interactions. This will lead to exciting new opportunities in fundamental condensed matter physics and subsequently, in quantum devices realizing completely new functionalities. They answer the pressing need for novel quantum materials with tuneable properties to enable completely new types of approaches in quantum technologies. This will keep Europe at the forefront of the second quantum revolution and create yet unimagined future breakthrough technologies.",2704720,2025,2029,ERC,Finland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Quantum technology components for space communication,"The goal of QuTechSpace is to push the development of key components for space quantum communication and to facilitate standardization of the technology. To this end, we will advance three core technology components: entangled photon source (EPS), prepare and measure (P&M) source, and the post-processing software for the QKD protocol. In particular, we will increase the performance parameters such as sending rates, reduce the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP), and perform space qualification of hardware. The technology development will be accompanied by facilitating the standardization process of space quantum communication technologies and systems through active involvement in standardization bodies. By including European entities ranging from academics over new space companies and quantum technology developers to large system integrators, the joint European ecosystem will be included in the process and together we will work towards the joint goal of reaching European sovereignty in space quantum technologies. QuTechSpace will also take into account developments in the field of space quantum communication. The technology development will be completed through testing in relevant environment, reaching TRL 6. Furthermore, the different technology components will be tested together in an end-to-end implementation of the quantum chain in the laboratory, providing crucial insights into the heart of space-based quantum-communication systems. Finally, it is important to highlight that the developed components can be used for quantum key distribution as well as for realization of the quantum internet. QuTechSpace will conclude by giving an outlook and recommendations for future developments and implementations of quantum-communication systems.",2704332,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany; France; Spain; Spain,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Integrated femtosecond laser based frequency comb and photonic microwave oscillator,"In femto-iCOMB, we develop the first integrated femtosecond laser-based frequency comb that can serve as the basis for a wide variety of optical and Radio-Frequency (RF) technologies ranging from high resolution environmental and health sensing to LIDAR and RADAR. Femto-iCOMB is based on the successful EIC-pathfinder project FEMTOCHIP, where we demonstrate an integrated high power femtosecond laser enabling extremely low jitter on chip scale. Here, we tam the free running comb from the integrated femtosecond laser with on-chip continuum generation, carrier-envelope and repetition rate locking to an optical reference to become a fully stabilized femtosecond laser frequency comb (FSLFC) with extremely high frequency stability. We use the femto-iCOMB to pursue photonic microwave oscillators for a variety of applications ranging from autonomous driving to ultra-low phase noise oscillators for advanced signal generators and RF-test and measurement equipment and demonstrate these devices in relevant industrial environments for each application. These prototype field tests will validate the TRL levels achieved for each application and together with surveys of potential customers will inform the business case to be made for each potential product line.",2704317,2024,2027,European Commission,Germany; Germany,EU,Classical Physics; Quantum Physics
Open Superior Efficient Solar Atmosphere Model Extension,"The goal is to develop a time evolving model for the entire solar atmosphere, including the chromosphere and transition region, based on a multi-fluid description. At present, models are steady, rely on a single-fluid description and include only the corona due to computational challenges. We plan to use time-evolving ion-neutral and ion-neutral-electron models. The multi-fluid approach will enable us to describe the intricate physics in the partially ionized chromosphere and quantize the transfer of momentum and energy between the atmospheric layers. The questions where the solar wind originates and solar flares and coronal mass ejections are driven have both fundamental scientific importance and substantial socio-economic impact. Indeed, the solar atmospheric model is the crucial missing link in the Sun-to-Earth model chain to predict the arrival and impact of CMEs at Earth.
What makes this goal now possible is the combination of our implicit solver with a high-order flux-reconstruction (FR) method. The implicit solver avoids the numerical instabilities that lead to strict time step limitations on explicit schemes. The high-order FR method enables high-fidelity simulations on very coarse grids even in zones of high gradients. We will start from this new development and introduce three critical innovations. First, we will combine high-order FR with physics-based r-adaptive (moving) unstructured grids redistributing grid points to regions with high gradients. Second, we will implement CPU-GPU algorithms for the new heterogeneous supercomputers advanced by HPC-Europa. Third, we will implement AI generated magnetograms to make the model respond to the time-varying photospheric magnetic field which is crucial for understanding important properties.
We will thus develop a first-in-its-kind high-order GPU-enabled 3D time-accurate solver for multi-fluid plasmas. If successful, we will have the most advanced solar atmosphere model implemented in an operational environment.",2704300,2024,2029,ERC,Belgium,EU,Astronomical Sciences
QUANTUM-ENHANCED FREE-ELECTRON SPECTROMICROSCOPY,"Ultrafast electron microscopy relies on the spatial, spectral, and temporal manipulation of free electrons with nm/meV/fs precision to map the structural dynamics as well as the vibrational and electronic ground and excited states of nanomaterials. With QUEFES I will introduce a conceptually disruptive approach to capitalize on the quantum nature of free electrons and their interactions with matter and radiation fields aiming to obtain previously inaccessible information on the atomic-scale dynamics of such materials, to reveal hidden properties of the quantum vacuum, and to control the many-body state of quantum matter.
I will address five challenges of major scientific relevance: (i) the spatiotemporal control over the density matrix of free electrons by interaction with suitably designed optical fields to overcome the current limits of space/time/energy resolution in time-resolved electron spectromicroscopy; (ii) a disruptive approach to map the nanoscale quantum fluctuations and the out-of-equilibrium state associated with optical near fields in vacuum and polaritonic excitations in nanomaterials; (iii) a Fourier-transform-inspired method to image the spatiotemporal evolution of atomic structures, charge carriers, and dynamical screening; (iv) the use of free electrons to flexibly read and write the many-body quantum state of trapped Rydberg atoms and quantum gases; and (v) the realization of all-electron pump-probe spectroscopy combined with the formation of dynamically screened multiple free-electron bound states for lossless charge transport in a semiconductor.
I will pursue these research frontiers by relying on the strong interdisciplinary theoretical background of my group at the intersection between electron-light-matter interactions and nanophotonics, introducing a change of paradigm in the use of free electrons to break the current limits of spectromicroscopy and having the potential for revolutionizing our ability to image and manipulate the nanoworld.",2703209,2024,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Strong light-matter coupled ultra-fast and non-linear quantum semiconductor devices,"This project will combine for the first time strong light-matter coupling in quantum-confined electronic systems with the optical and electronic non-linearities of semiconductor heterostructures: we will develop device concepts with unique ultra-fast, non-linear and quantum functionalities. The key ingredient is an unconventional use of the strong light-matter coupling regime (SCR), a fascinating concept that is recently transitioning from basic physics to quantum devices.
We will first address fundamental physics problems, then we’ll turn to device applications. A key conceptual building block is that the nature of optical non-linearities is radically modified when operating in the SCR. This has profound consequences. We will study few-photon non-linearities, in particular the ultimate case of devices that can “sense” virtual photons. This will lead us to device concepts whose behavior is enabled by vacuum-field photons, bringing us radically beyond the state of art.  
We will then move to the case of many photons. We will focus on absorption saturation, that explored only in the weak coupling regime, where it is difficult to engineer. We have discovered that in the SCR instead it becomes tailorable and previously unavailable functionalities can be envisioned. This has profound consequences: we will demonstrate semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAM) for the mid-IR spectral range, a technology that revolutionized ultra-fast lasers in the near-IR, but is missing at longer wavelengths. We will apply them to fiber and interband cascade lasers, radically advancing the potential of those sources. 
These are ground-breaking demonstrations for mid-IR science and technology. SMART-QDEV is a project rooted in fundamental physics research, able to open up new horizons and research opportunities on longer-term and visionary topics. At the same time, SMART-QDEV has a clear vision for applications.",2702110,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Quantum Physics
Advancing orbitronics by pushing electron orbital angular momentum to terahertz speed,"The spin angular momentum (S) of the electron has significantly extended conventional electronics, which relies on the electron charge (C), by new, so-called spintronic functionalities. Examples include magnetization switching, the transport of S and its detection, even down to femtosecond time scales. To boost the efficiency of spintronics, the so far neglected yet equally fascinating and important orbital angular momentum (L) of electrons is considered to be a powerful pathway. Orbitronic phenomena such as L-based transport, torques and magneto-optic effects have much larger magnitude than their S counterparts and may, thus, efficiently complement or even replace spintronic functionalities. Microscopically, L is completely different from S. Its dynamics involves new physics that needs to be understood, in particular on ultrafast time scales.

In the ORBITERA project, my team and I will obtain unprecedented insights into L dynamics by using femtosecond optical pulses and terahertz (THz) electric fields, which couple directly to the motion of conduction electrons at their natural frequencies and relaxation rates. We will tackle important challenges of general orbitronics and, in particular, separate L- and S-based effects despite their identical macroscopic symmetry properties, build ultrafast generators and detectors of exclusively L currents, reveal the nature of L transport (e.g., ballistic, diffusive, tunneling), measure the magnetic moments forming an L current, probe the interaction of L with the crystal lattice, temporally resolve L-S and L-C interconversion, and apply THz L torque to ultimately switch magnetic order ultrafast.

By establishing THz orbitronics, new methodology (such as ultrafast drivers of L currents and L-conductance spectroscopy at 0.1-50 THz) and applications (such as the detection of THz electric fields without relying on the weak spin-orbit coupling) will be developed that can be used by a community beyond specialized THz labs.",2700034,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Brownian particles in nonequilibrium baths,"The power of thermodynamics comes at the expense of certain assumptions and idealizations. An important premise is the concept of a thermal bath which is in contact with the examined system. Typically, such baths are idealized as an infinite reservoir of heat that remains in equilibrium regardless of whether the system in contact is in equilibrium or not. Such description, however, is only valid when the bath relaxation time is much faster than typical time scales of the system. Otherwise, a driven system excites the bath out of equilibrium and will interact with nonequilibrium fluctuations. Recent experiments using colloidal particles within viscoelastic baths, whose relaxation times are comparable to colloidal timescales, have revealed surprising and only poorly understood novel behaviors which are attributed to the nonequilibrium properties of the bath. Examples include particle oscillations inside moving optical traps, a fastened hopping dynamics across potential barriers, an up to 100-fold enhanced rotational diffusion of drifting particles, but also the presence of about one-million-fold increased Magnus forces.  Here, we propose a series of novel experiments aiming to uncover the impact of a non-equilibrated bath on the behavior of externally driven colloidal particles but also to exploit such effect for applications. In those experiments we will investigate how nonequilibrium surroundings affect erasure processes of logical information or modify the design of optimal finite time protocols. In addition, we will construct an unprecedented microscopic engine which – unlike conventional heat engines – is not operated between two heat baths but which is periodically coupled to nonequilibrium baths with different relaxation times. The selection of the examples being pursued within this proposal has been chosen not only to demonstrate the manifold consequences of nonequilibrium baths but also provide possible overlaps beyond the field of soft condensed matter.",2699274,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Classical Physics
Sensing and Quantum Engineering with Magnetically Functionalized Ultracoherent Mechanical Resonators,"Strained nanomechanical resonators have record-high quality factors at room temperature and state-of-the-art thermal-limited force sensitivities. However, they are typically made of dielectric materials that do not interact strongly with neither sensing targets nor other quantum systems. I propose to functionalize ultracoherent mechanical resonators with a nanomagnet to unleash their potential both for nanoscale magnetic sensing and the creation of hybrid quantum systems. The force sensitivity of the best strained nanomechanical resonators allows sensing of single proton spins when functionalized with a nanomagnet, providing new ways to characterize quantum devices and to investigate the three-dimensional structure of complex molecules such as proteins. 

Direct coupling of mechanical resonators and a single two-level system is a challenging but attractive route to synthesis of arbitrary quantum motional states in mechanical resonators. The low frequency of strained nanomechanical resonators has made this type of interaction elusive, but recent progress makes it conceivable to coherently couple a single atom and mechanical motion by direct magnetic coupling. I will leverage optical tweezer technology to directly couple the internal quantum states of a single atom to the motion of an ultracoherent mechanical resonator and exploit this interaction to generate quantum states of motion.

By combining integrated photonics with ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators, SEQUENCE will develop unprecedently sensitive on-chip force sensors that can be used for characterization of biomolecules and quantum devices. The hybrid atom-mechanical system will realize a new interaction between single quantum systems and mechanical resonators which can be used in tests of fundamental physics, quantum sensing and quantum information processing.",2699273,2024,2029,ERC,Sweden,EU,Quantum Physics
Silicon opto-electro-mechanics for bridging the gap between photonics and microwaves,"Conversion between electrical and optical signals enabled the use of near-infrared (near-IR) photons for high data rate transmission through optical fibre networks. Likewise, coherent conversion between microwave and optical photons stands as a promising solution to transfer quantum states between remote quantum processors, thus enabling the development of large-scale quantum networks. However, the vast frequency difference between microwave (GHz) and near-IR (200 THz) optical photons hampers direct coherent conversion. This limitation could be circumvented by phonon-mediated transduction, which is a coherent two-step process, comprising electromechanical and optomechanical conversions. On-chip microwave-optical conversion mediated by GHz phonons has the potential to be extremely efficient due to the large optomechanical response of common materials, and the similar wavelength of GHz phonons and near-IR photons. Yet, it is an open challenge to achieve efficient electromechanical and optomechanical conversion simultaneously in a single integrated circuit. State-of-the-art demonstrations show that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) allow efficient electromechanical conversion, while cavity optomechanics utilize tightly confined optical and mechanical modes to yield strong optomechanical coupling. However, combining these two approaches is still considered challenging, if not impossible. The SPRING project will overcome these limitations by developing a fundamentally new optomechanical coupling approach to bridge SAW electromechanics and cavity optomechanics. The original idea is to use subwavelength nanostructuration of silicon cavities to couple tightly confined optical modes and SAWs. The SPRING strategy will be used to demonstrate coherent microwave-optical conversion of single photons and quantum state transfer between superconducting qubits, monolithically integrated in a silicon chip, opening a new path for applications in communications, sensing and computing.",2696999,2024,2028,ERC,France,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
"TURBULENCE, PEBBLES AND PLANETESIMALS : THE ORIGIN OF MINOR BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM","The Minor Bodies of the Solar System, Asteroids, Trojans, Comets and Kuiper Belt Objects are left over planetary building bricks called planetesimals once abundant in the solar nebula. Via collisions and accretion of large grains, aka Pebbles, they grew into planets. 
The efficiency of Planetesimals formation via a gravitational collapse of Pebble clouds and the characteristics of the forming planetesimals are determined by the size distribution and local concentration of the largest grains, both being regulated by gas turbulence. But turbulence itself is dependent on the abundance of small grains, by regulating the ionisation level and the radiative cooling process.
In this project we will develop radically new types of numerical experiments of three stages of planetesimal formation, with the goal of a self-consistent turbulence and pebble size distribution:
1. Development of tools to measure the transport, diffusion, and collisions of dust grains for arbitrary MHD or Radiation Hydro disk simulations to derive via an Coagulation Code and Machine Learning Technique a consistent particle size distribution for consistent opacities and ionisation rates to feed back into the turbulence simulation. 
2. Implementation of a tree-solver for the gravitational attraction among pebbles in self-consistent turbulence simulations to identify the properties of pebble clouds that can undergo gravitational collapse. 
3. Integration of an implicit solver for our Lagrangian Particle scheme to model the collapse of pebble clouds, while not only deriving a mass function and multiplicity, but with a model for elasticity and porosity analyse the spin, shape, and compression for the forming planetesimals, comets and asteroids.
In close collaboration with our scientific community we will calibrate our turbulence models and the planetesimal formation process on the observation of disks around young stars as well as observational and laboratory data on Minor Bodies in the Solar System.",2695390,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Space Sciences
Optoelectronic and all-optical hyperspin machines for large-scale computing,"Efficient hardware for combinatorial optimization and machine learning impacts science, engineering, and society. With new computational models, photonics tackle problems intractable with conventional computing systems. However, existing devices only scale up to thousands of spins and operate at the second timescale. 
I demonstrate photonic machines for ultrafast parallel processing of millions of spins with microsecond timescale. The strategy is minimizing a class of functions, the Ising Hamiltonian, by a new computational system that uses a high-dimensional feature space and speeds up optimization by orders of magnitude by ultrafast nonlinear optical processes. I build digital, optoelectronics, and all-optical classical and quantum devices and benchmark with real-world, large-scale problems.
By spatial modulation technology and a cheap, simple, and scalable design, light propagation is recurrently trained towards the ground state of a programmable Ising Hamiltonian. Starting from my proof-of-concept, first, I aim at the energetically efficient computing of large-scale Hamiltonians. Second, I include self-optimizing all-optical nonlinear ultrafast phase-locking processes. Third, I demonstrate record combinatorial optimization by letting the spins evolve in a high dimensional space to guarantee high success probability.

Commercial Fusion Energy with Short-Pulse High-Intensity Lasers and Nanostructured Fuel Targets,"To achieve climate targets while maintaining industrial value creation and prosperity in Europe, EU companies must be able to switch to clean and competitive energy. Marvel Fusion (“MF”), founded in Munich in 2019, pursues a new and fast-track to commercialize fusion energy. The unique approach builds on the laser-fusion concept of the National Ignition Facility (“NIF”), where energy gain was demonstrated for the first time in 2022. With diode-pumped laser systems, nanostructured targets and the use of mixed fuels, MF bypasses the main problems of traditional fusion concepts to achieve a commercially viable power plant concept. MF has performed more than 2,000 experiments over the past three years to validate its approach. With the completion of the demonstration facility in Colorado by 2027 with two proprietary laser systems developed in collaboration with SPRIN-D, MF will reach a full proof-of-technology – with infrastructure and laser of the facility already fully funded. Afterwards, MF will build a pilot powerplant by 2033 with 100 MW output, with Siemens Energy as development partner. To achieve their ambitious goals, MF has assembled a world-class team of scientists and entrepreneurs, and a network of academic and industrial partners, including collaborations with Colorado State (“CSU”), Stanford, and LMU.

High-Performance Computational Photochemistry and Spectroscopy,"The future of modern sustainable technologies lies in the exploitation of solar energy and in harnessing the sun’s practically infinite energy. For fundamental as well as target-oriented research in this direction, computer simulations of the ongoing photochemical processes and electronic spectroscopy of the underlying molecular materials are indispensable. While for smaller molecules, computational photochemistry can nowadays provide highly accurate results and reliable predictions, the limit in applicable molecular system size is quickly reached, and the obtained results often come with an unpredictable error requiring a posteriori validation. Indeed, we are lacking efficient and sufficiently accurate and reliable excited-state ab initio methods reaching out for organic molecular systems with more than 500 second-row atoms. 
In HIPERCOPS, we aim at closing this gap by deriving highly efficient and genuinely parallel ab initio methods for the calculation of excited electronic, electron-detached and electron-attached states for execution on modern high-performance computer architectures, whose full potential is impossible to leverage by existing standard quantum chemical program packages. To address this problem, we choose the algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) family of methods, since these schemes offer clear advantages, for instance, numerical stability, easy to use, predictable accuracy. We will exploit novel genuinely parallel concepts and solution strategies for ADC schemes to enable them for HPC architectures. Our developed methods and resulting easy-to-use software will thus push the boundaries of accurate and predictable computational photochemistry to unprecedented molecular system sizes enabling and promoting research in, for example, the areas of functional optoelectronic devices and photovoltaics, molecular solar thermal energy conversion, solar-driven nanomachines, towards efficient molecular harnessing of sun light.",2693228,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Black Hole Stability,"The discovery of black holes, first as explicit solutions of Einstein equations of general relativity, and later as possible explanations of astrophysical phenomena, has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. From a mathematical perspective, a central issue is to investigate the stability of these fascinating objects. This is the focus of the present proposal containing the following work packages:

-Kerr stability conjecture. This concerns the nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes which form a 2-parameter family of explicit solutions to Einstein vacuum equations. It has become, since its discovery by R. Kerr in 1963, a central topic in general relativity, first during the golden age of black hole physics, and in the last twenty years in mathematical relativity. These efforts have led to the recent resolution, by the PI and collaborators, of the conjecture in the slowly rotating case. The goal of this work package is to tackle the general case.

-Black hole stability with matter. Breakthrough concerning the stability of Kerr for Einstein vacuum equations opens the door to other physically relevant cases in the context of Einstein equations coupled to matter. This work package aims at proving the stability of charged Kerr-Newman black holes for Einstein-Maxwell equations, Kerr back holes for massless Einstein-Vlasov equation, as well as the stability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes in the case of an arbitrarily small cosmological constant.

-Price's law and Kerr stability. An open problem concerns the optimal decay rate for perturbations of Kerr that can be achieved in the Kerr stability problem. The analogous problem for corresponding linear toy models is known as Price's law. Obtaining an optimal decay rate in the context of the Kerr stability problem would not only vastly extend Price's law, but it is also expected to have important implications on the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture concerning the deterministic character of Einstein equations.",2692629,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
An acoustic quantum interface for circuits and spins,"A wide variety of physical platforms are currently being explored for building quantum technologies, each with their own strengths and shortcomings. Future quantum devices will likely be hybrid in nature, combining different types of quantum systems that complement each other and provide different types of functionality. Phonons, the quanta of mechanical motion, have been widely studied as an universal mediator between various quantum objects, ranging from electromagnetic waves, to atoms and ions, to circuits and spins in the solid state. At the same time, mechanical objects in the quantum regime are interesting objects themselves. For example, their extremely high quality factors and coherence times make them promising candidates for quantum memories, and the fact that they are mechanical objects with a range of mass scales means that they can be used as sensors and for studies of fundamental physics. However, our tools to directly addressing mechanical motion in the quantum regime are limited, so interfacing them with a wider range of other quantum objects provides new tools for controlling and measuring their quantum properties, and is therefore crucial for making further use of their fascinating capabilities.Two of the most well-studied solid state quantum information processing platforms are superconducting (SC) circuits and color centers in diamond, and they are a perfect example of how different platforms can complement each other. SC circuits are able to perform fast quantum operations on a large number of qubits and can be engineered to have a wide variety of geometries and properties. However, their coherence times are generally less than 1 ms, and they lack an interface to optical photons for long-distance quantum communications and networking. The electronic spin of color centers and their nuclear spin environment can form a small quantum register with coherence times exceeding one minute that can be optically addressed. However, the properties of each color center species is mostly fixed, and connecting many qubits into a large processor in a deterministic manner remains an outstanding challenge. In our Sinergia project, we propose to demonstrate a phononic quantum interface between SC circuits and spin qubits associated with silicon-vacancy color centers in diamond. Such a hybrid system would take advantage of the strengths of each platform while compensating for their shortcomings. Specifically, the SC circuit will act as the processing unit, while the spin qubits act as the memory. They are connected through an acoustic mode that can efficiently couple to both systems while acting as a buffer that helps to maintain their desirable properties.The usual challenge in building hybrid quantum systems is bringing together diverse parts on many levels. A successful realization of a hybrid quantum platform depends not only on physical components and materials from various disciplines, which have to be combined and made compatible, but also on the corresponding experimental, theoretical, and technical knowledge. Our consortium gathers the essential expertise that will be needed to turn this proposal into reality, including materials science, mechanical engineering, experimental physics, and theory. While interdisciplinary research is thus a fundamental element of our project, the consortium is focused enough to maximize the chances of success. Widening the scope even further would drastically reduce our potential for creating impact in a highly competitive and technically challenging field.  Our project takes maximum advantage of the diverse and world-leading quantum science research that exists in Switzerland, while making crucial connections to the wider European community. If successful, our results will provide an essential building block of future quantum technologies.",2688735,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Advanced lasers for quantum technologies,"Quantum technologies represent one of the fastest emerging high-tech markets. The growth in the production of quantum
computers goes hand in hand with the need for more affordable and reliable components of their hardware. In atomic quantum
technologies, frequency-stabilised lasers are crucial elements that are used for cooling, manipulating and detecting the qubits.
However, most of the systems currently on sale in the market are conceived for a laboratory environment rather than for an industrial
production, and the very few turn-key systems that are available are bulky, complex and expensive.
In AQLAS, we merge an innovative laser design and a recently developed technology on fiber interferometry to realize a new,
affordable and compact laser module for implementing entanglement and high-fidelity qubit read-out in atomic quantum
computers. The new laser module overcomes comparable commercial systems in terms of size (4 to 10 times smaller) and cost (2 to 5
times cheaper). In AQLAS, we start from a TRL 4 proof-of-concept that has already demonstrated in the laboratory, and enclose it in a transportable 19’’ rack unit containing all the components, which will represent out Minimum Viable Product (MVP). With the MVP, we will reach TRL 5 by demonstrating the system’s performance in the use case, i.e. a qubit processing at a quantum computer company. After this validation, we will focus on transforming the MVP into an OEM system for industrial production, thus
reaching TRL 6. During the project, we will establish a feasible business strategy that will be refined with potential customers and
investors. The funding readiness level will be elevated to 6, and we will create a strong IPR strategy with the goal of creating a new
startup for which a solid investment case is presented.

"Understanding Lightning from the Lab: Initiation, Propagation, and X-ray Emissions","Despite the huge impact of lightning, its fundamental properties are still very poorly understood. With this project I want to build an infrastructure of carefully designed laboratory experiments in a novel physical regime, that will provide the conditions required to understand lightning phenomena. I will use this to answer some of the major open questions in lightning and high voltage discharge research. I will provide major scientific breakthroughs to answer the questions on 1) how lightning is initiated, 2) how lightning propagates by so-called leaders and 3) how these leaders emit energetic radiation (X-rays). The experiments will be complemented by dedicated numerical simulations for the best interpretation.  
Initiation of lightning within thunderclouds involves a complex, yet not understood interplay between electric fields, ice particles, charges and cosmic rays. I will have ice-like particles fall through varying electric fields in the novel discharge chamber and observe when discharges form and when they are strong enough to initiate lightning. 
Once initiated, lightning propagates through so-called leader discharges, but the exact mechanism has only been hypothesized. I want to understand how this is controlled by streamer discharges around it. During inception and propagation, lightning emits X-rays and other energetic radiation with energies far above expected electron energies. I will pinpoint the location and mechanism of such emissions with high reproducibility. 
The experiments will be unique in the world, due to the large discharge chamber, its highly controlled atmosphere, and its accompanying pulse source surpassing existing experiments by orders in voltage risetime and amplitude. This will expose new physical phenomena and thereby lead to great insights and uses: for the lightning community, validation of simulations and theories and understanding of lightning radio emissions, and for high voltage engineers tools to improve their devices.",2683949,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Physical modelling of stellar activity effects to discover and measure exoearths,"Exoplanet research has experienced enormous growth and is now pushing instrumental limits to find temperate terrestrial planets and precisely characterise their atmospheres. Extreme-precision radial velocity (RV) instruments (e.g. ESPRESSO), offering 10 cm/s stability, and space telescopes (e.g. JWST, Ariel), attaining relative flux uncertainties of 10 ppm are becoming a reality. But there is a shadow of concern hovering over such fantastic performances. The intrinsic variability of the stellar hosts can overwhelm the instrument error to become the dominant uncertainty. Recent results with ESPRESSO and JWST data provide vivid illustrations of the daunting effects of such limiting factor. An ambitious, ground-breaking, and comprehensive effort to model and correct out stellar activity effects shall therefore be undertaken. Our pioneering results show that the unique combination of a physical model and contemporaneous multi-technique monitoring can disentangle the effects of stellar activity from RV time-series and transit spectroscopy. The SPOTLESS project will implement this methodology by building a realistic stellar activity simulator and develop correction strategies using, e.g., machine learning algorithms and direct inversion. This is more reliable than purely data-driven methods, which often suffer from overfitting due to the lack of a physical context. Four main objectives will be pursued: 1) A physical model of the active solar surface to explain Sun-as-a-star observables, 2) Generalise to other spectral types & parameters, 3) Physically-motivated RV activity corrections at 10 cm/s, and 4) Physically-motivated transit activity corrections at 10 ppm. From available and future observations, SPOTLESS will deliver new challenging exoplanet RV discoveries and unbiased transmission spectra, taking exoplanet research to the next level by enabling the detection and characterisation of exoearths, and the eventual search for signs of biological activity.",2681697,2024,2029,ERC,Spain; Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Unveiling the Physics of High-Density Relativistic Pair Plasma Jets in the Laboratory,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. They occur at cosmological distances and are the result of the collapse of massive stars or neutron stars mergers, with emission of relativistic 'fireballs' of electron-positron pairs. From astrophysical observations, a wealth of information has been gleaned about the mechanism that leads to such strong emission of radiation, with leading models predicting that this is due to the disruption of the beam as it blasts through the surrounding plasma. This produces shocks and hydromagnetic turbulence that generate synchrotron emission, potentially accelerating to ultra-high energies the protons which are observed
on Earth as cosmic rays. However, there is no direct evidence of the generation of either magnetic fields or cosmic rays by GRBs. Estimates are often based on crude energy equipartition arguments or idealized numerical simulations that struggle to capture the extreme plasma conditions. We propose to address this lacuna by conducting laboratory experiments at CERN to mimic the jet propagation through its surrounding plasma. Such experiments will enable in situ measurement of the plasma properties, with exquisite details that cannot be achieved elsewhere. The experiments also complement numerical simulations by providing long measurement times extending into the non-linear regime where numerical simulations are not possible today. The proposed experiments will study fundamental physics processes, unveil the microphysics of GRBs, and address the following, yet answered, key questions:
1) What mechanisms drive the energetic beams unstable and their long-term evolution?
2) What is the role of turbulence in the acceleration of particles to the highest energies?
3) What is the interplay between magnetic fields and particles and how does this affect the observed
electromagnetic emission?
We will provide a new window in high energy astrophysics using novel Earth-based laboratory experiments.",2676882,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Astroparticle Physics with a Trapped Electron,"No one knows what 84% of the matter in the universe is, and the goal of APTE is to
find out. APTE will investigate two leading types of dark matter: axions and millicharged
particles. Axions not only resolve a longstanding puzzle in particle physics, but if their
mass is 0.001-1 meV they are an excellent dark matter candidate. Millicharged particles
arise in some theories beyond the Standard Model and have recently been suggested as a com-
ponent of dark matter that could explain the anomalous cooling of hydrogen in the early universe.

APTE will use an electron in a cryogenic Penning trap in an entirely new application: a
quantum sensor for astroparticle physics. The radial modes of the trapped electron will be
monitored for transitions caused by collisions with millicharged dark matter or the absorption
of single microwave photons from axion decays. Changes in radial quantum state will be
imprinted onto the trapped electron's axial frequency using a strong magnetic inhomogeneity,
the same principle as used to measure the electron magnetic moment. Drawing on my
experience in BASE, one of the world's most sensitive cryogenic Penning traps, I will pioneer
the use of advanced phase sensitive measurement protocols of my own invention. These will
be used to monitor the electron's axial frequency for phase jumps which occur when the radial
mode changes. With this electron single photon counter we will be able to overcome the Stan-
dard Quantum Limit which severely degrades our ability to investigate axion masses > 0.04 meV.

APTE will perform a first search for dark matter axions with masses around 0.128 meV
and millicharged dark matter particles with masses up to at least 1 GeV and charges 10^-1 to 10^-7 e. Both measurements probe important theories in a regime where there is currently no
data and few proposed experiments. This ground-breaking project will lay the foundations for
a future program of axion searches, as well as other applications in fundamental physics.",2673994,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Quantum Physics
Modelling Center for Quantum Technologies,"Quantum technologies have the potential to revolutionise the IT, pharmacy, chemistry, and energy sectors. The involvement of Widening Countries in the development of emerging technologies can narrow the gap with more advanced EU members and enhance overall innovation in the high-tech industry. Poland, equipped with significant expertise in theoretical physics, a substantial pool of top-tier information technology professionals, and advanced high-performance computing infrastructure, strategically aligns with these initiatives. However, the development of Quantum Technology faces substantial barriers. Due to the intricate nature of quantum processes, quantum states are often very fragile, and designing useful devices requires modelling with advanced theoretical and numerical tools. There is also a barrier on the theory side: despite potentially groundbreaking ideas, many concepts remain unexplored due to the absence of suitable modelling methods to demonstrate their applicability potential. The Modelling Center for Quantum Technologies group at the Center for Theoretical Physics PAS, Poland, aims to bridge the theory-experiment gap by developing and applying new methods to describe open quantum many-body systems comprehensively. Additionally, it will address the academia-business gap by establishing an open-source-based quantum modelling centre and fostering connections with research and industry partners through various dissemination and exploitation measures. With the expertise, networking capabilities, and strong commitment of the ERA Chair holder, this group of excellence strives to become a world leader in quantum system modelling, unlocking the full potential of theoretical research at the Center for Theoretical Physics PAS.",2670732,2025,2029,European Commission,Poland,EU,Quantum Physics
INVESTIGATION OF THE ENANTIOMERIC IMBALANCE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THROUGH ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROPOLARIMETRY,"Amino acids and the reference nucleobases for RNA and DNA can be formed in space ice under high energy, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation. This statement is based on twenty years of laboratory research and has profound implications in the understanding of the emergence of life in the Cosmos, the universality of the processes involved and the compatibility of life forms across the Universe. 

However, this laboratory work still needs to be confronted with actual, on-field measurements. Promising data have been obtained through in-situ techniques: the analysis of carbonaceous chondrites such as the Murchinson meteorite or the detection of Glycine in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Unfortunately, neither of these techniques suits well a systematic investigation. Meteorites reaching the Earth surface represent a reduced and biased subset and contamination by Earth-based amino acids needs to be carefully controlled. Space probes such as Rosetta are very costly and limited in scope given the constraints in space navigation. Thus, it is crucial to develop remote detection techniques to carry out a comprehensive study of the distribution of amino acids within the Solar System, their relative abundances and their enantiomeric imbalance. According to recent estimates, this is possible at VUV wavelengths for optically active amino acids such as the very abundant alanine. 

The interaction between VUV radiation and optically active amino acids in space bodies is yet poorly studied. The formation of crystallites and complex structures, the interaction between the various molecules, the dependence on the VUV photon energy, polarization and flux needs to be quantified, prior to any attempt of remote detection in the Solar System. This project aims to carry such in-depth study and develop a laboratory prototype of the instrument to make, at the least, alanine remote detection feasible by a small probe navigating the asteroids belt.",2666916,2024,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Quantum Materials for Quantum Devices,"In the past decade the study of Quantum Materials for Quantum Devices (QuantuMDs) has been recognized as an important research goal in both academia and industry. QuantuMDs are predicted to be the building blocks of next-generation modern technology. The material group most suitable for use in QuantuMDs is the group of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which exhibit exotic properties, such as superconductivity, charge order, Mott physics and topological states.

My main goal is to develop new and exotic QuantuMDs from a variety of pure or intercalated TMDs; these new materials will enable the establishment of a new material platform suitable for quantum technology. I will pursue the fabrication and investigation of various highly correlated systems via multiple measurement techniques including electrical current pulse manipulation. I will adopt a unique combined approach of material synthesis control, high-end device fabrication and broad measurement techniques. My ability to perform a full experimental cycle on any system studied, from crystal growth to advanced fabrication and application, will enable me to undertake the most complex problems and produce creative routes to achieve the proposal goal.

The impact of this work will be two-fold; First, the manipulation of exotic phases will open vast scientific possibilities in the exploration of nontrivial physical effects, specifically of single-material low-dimensional highly correlated condensed matter systems. Second, the ultra-low power, ultra-fast dynamics and robustness towards external unwanted perturbations of our expected QuantuMDs will create unlimited opportunities for the future of technological applications. The enticing possibilities include ultra-fast slidetronics-based devices, fault-tolerant superconducting quantum bits and low-power topological magnetic random-access memory devices.",2660701,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
"Phase, time and correlations in free electron wave packets","Electron emission from matter is a widespread phenomenon in nature, with examples including the photoionization of atoms and molecules, photoemission from solids, and the release of electrons due to ionizing radiation in biology. Complete information about the emitted electrons is contained in the amplitude and phase of their wave packets. While state-of-the-art electron spectroscopy routinely accesses the amplitude of these wave packets, the phase of free electron wave packets remains inaccessible. My team and I aim to develop an experimental technique to measure the phase of free electron wave packets without interfering with their creation mechanism. This will be groundbreaking, as the phase of the free electron wave packet carries information about the quantum mechanical properties of photoionization and the electron in its bound state prior to ionization.
We will accomplish this task by constructing a novel, microscopic, ultrafast free-electron-interferometer, in which replicas of the initial free electron wave packet are generated, shifted in momentum space, and brought to interference. At the heart of this innovative interferometric scheme are two crossed pulsed standing light waves that interact with the wave packet after its creation on femtosecond timescales. We will scale this approach to be applicable to correlated few-body wave packets by combining the light field interferometer with coincident multi-particle detection in a COLTRIMS reaction microscope.
Employing this groundbreaking method, we will address three objectives: (1) We will investigate the time evolution of the phase of an atomic photoelectron wave packet with a linear and with a helical interferometer made from light carrying orbital angular momentum. (2) We will study wave packets emitted from molecules, including chiral molecules. (3) We will examine correlations and entanglement within two-electron wave packets and between photoelectrons and their parent ions",2660142,2025,2030,ERC,Germany,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Flexible Attosecond Soliton Transients for Extreme Resolution,"Ultrafast laser pulses allow us to follow fundamental processes such as chemical reactions and electron transport at their natural timescale. Because optical (ultraviolet, visible or infrared) laser sources have not been able to reach the attosecond pulse duration required to investigate the fastest events, ultrafast science has moved to extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) wavelengths. However, XUV photon energies are far higher than the scale of chemically and electronically relevant valence-electron excitations, so XUV spectroscopy is at most only indirectly sensitive to some of the most important interactions. Furthermore, the low pulse energy of attosecond XUV sources has so far prevented experiments with true attosecond time resolution.
In FASTER, I will push far beyond the limits of conventional laser sources and bring attosecond time resolution to the optical domain. Using advanced optical soliton dynamics in gas-filled hollow capillary fibres, I will create ultrabroadband supercontinuum probe pulses and wavelength-tuneable pump pulses from the vacuum ultraviolet (100 nm) to the near infrared (1000 nm) with both attosecond duration and sufficient pulse energy for attosecond pump-probe studies. Using the flexibility of soliton dynamics and all-optical spatio-spectral manipulation, I will tailor these pulses to specific experiments.
I will then take one step further and develop two-dimensional spectroscopy with the same approach, combining ultrabroadband optical attosecond pulses with the ability to identify different excitation pathways and quantum coherences. In collaboration with expert groups, I will apply these new capabilities to some of the most challenging questions in ultrafast science and directly observe crucial valence-electron interactions with unprecedented time resolution.
FASTER aims at the physical limit of optical ultrafast laser pulses and a new regime of ultrafast spectroscopy, opening up entirely new ways of observing the fastest processes in nature.",2655358,2025,2030,ERC,United Kingdom,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Computational Cosmology and Gravitational Waves,"The discovery of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations opened a new window to the Universe. Space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as the LISA mission, enable an exciting opportunity: using gravitational waves from the very early Universe in the search for beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) particle physics.

The LISA science case identifies first order phase transitions as the most promising source of cosmological gravitational waves. There are no phase transitions in the Standard Model, and observation of a phase transition would be revolutionary: a direct signal of BSM physics. It is absolutely necessary to have accurate and reliable theoretical control of the gravitational wave production in BSM phase transitions in order to fully realize the science potential of the observations.

The overarching goal of CoCoS is to calculate, for a given BSM theory, the resulting gravitational wave power spectrum to  10--20\% accuracy.  This is more than an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art, where accuracy is limited by uncertainties inherent in standard perturbative approaches.  In CoCoS these problems are avoided by using several novel and state-of-the-art simulation techniques.

A first order phase transition in the early Universe proceeds through supercooling, critical bubble nucleation, and growth and collision of the bubbles.  Bubbles cause pressure waves, shocks and turbulence, which remains long after the transition has completed and create gravitational waves. In CoCoS the stages of the phase transitions are studied with innovative computational methods: effective field theory approach, which optimally combines perturbation theory and lattice simulations, and state-of-the-art viscous relativistic hydrodynamics.

The high-luminosity LHC and LISA will be operational at the same time, searching for complementary aspects of new physics. The accuracy reached in CoCoS is necessary to fully utilize this synergy.",2648715,2024,2029,ERC,Finland,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
New directions in piezoelectric phononic integrated circuits: exploiting field confinement (SOUNDMASTER),"The analogy between manipulating light and gigahertz (GHz) frequency acoustic waves in chip-scale platforms has been extensively explored, with ideas from silicon photonics, mainly strong geometric confinement and routing, being applied to acoustic waves to develop phononic integrated circuits (PnICs). It is important to note that while the light-sound analogy is generally applied to the strain field, acoustic waves in piezoelectric materials have a co-propagating electromagnetic (EM) field as well. This EM field, which oscillates at GHz frequencies, but is confined to acoustic wavelengths (~10^5 smaller), underpins the dominance of piezoelectric resonators and filters in radio frequency (RF) devices. Despite the advances made in PnICs in the past decade, the majority of piezoelectric devices, both bulk and surface wave based, still rely on weak transverse confinement and manipulation of quasi plane acoustic waves.

This project seeks to answer the question: if one could actively control and manipulate these co-propagating EM fields in waveguide geometries with strong transverse confinement, what qualitatively new sensing and information processing paradigms can one enable?

We show that by exploiting strong field enhancement in a PnIC platform, one can design resonant magnetic near field generators for electron spin resonance experiments that can improve the spin detection sensitivity by ~10^7, down to the thermal noise limit. In addition, by engineering acousto-electric interactions in waveguide geometries, acoustic phase shifters and mode-selective, non-reciprocal amplifiers can be realized that exert active control on acoustic wave propagation, and push active passive device integration to its limit, enabling a new class of devices for RF signal processing. To ensure these devices perform as expected, we also address the important question: can we get GHz frequency acoustic waves into and out of micrometre-scale devices with near-unity efficiency?",2648590,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Classical Physics"
Spin-momentum locking and correlated phenomena in chiral topological materials,"Chiral topological semimetals are a new class of quantum materials at the intersection of structural and electronic chirality. We discovered the first example of this material class three years ago and have since demonstrated that they host new fermionic quasiparticles without analogue in high-energy physics, which carry large and controllable topological charges. ChiralTopMat will go beyond these initial works and aims to discover new extraordinary properties that have only been predicted for these materials but for which experimental evidence remains elusive: 1) A new form of isotropic parallel spin-momentum locking that can be considered the natural counterpart of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, 2) new electronic phases that are both correlated and topological, and 3) interface effects with magnetic materials that could be exploited for new energy-efficient information technology applications. We will achieve these research goals by employing spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy on various energy scales, probing these materials' surface, bulk, and interface electronic structures. 

Whilst the proposed experiments are challenging, our prior work and recent preliminary results have demonstrated their feasibility. If successful, ChiralTopMat will build on these discoveries to search for structure-property relationships that can be used to control these new phenomena by chemical and structural modification. We envision that this new understanding will be the basis for future devices that exploit chiral topological semimetals for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices, which use multifold fermions for field-free switching of magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.",2643979,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Chemical Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
Hidden metastable mesoscopic states  in quantum materials,"Non-equilibrium states of matter have become of great fundamental and practical interest in recent years because of their wide importance in diverse areas of physics. With the rapid development of new time-resolved techniques, the temporal dynamics of competing processes and interactions were recently elucidated in a wide variety of complex condensed matter systems. However, the physics of metastable mesoscopically non-periodic quantum textures emerging from phase transitions has been largely experimentally inaccessible till now: current state of the art time-resolved methods using x-rays, electron diffraction, photoemission, THz and optical spectroscopy all average over multiple transition outcomes. Moreover, they cannot resolve irregular nonperiodic nanoscale structures. Thus, a large field of mesoscopic quantum physics of metastable quantum states remains largely unexplored. Here we propose to develop a unique set of tools to investigate mesoscopic metastable irregular textures created under controlled non-equilibrium conditions in quantum materials, with focus on topological transitions and quantum jamming phenomena. Temporally tempered excitation techniques combined with time-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy will be used to studying single and multiple transition outcomes with atomic spatial resolution on timescales from picoseconds to hours. Experiments supplemented by new theoretical approaches will address the creation processes, relaxation dynamics and quantum decoherence of metastable mesoscopic structures, as well as manipulation and control. Theoretical approaches for addressing resulting quantum states include fracton-derived models and quantum annealing on a quantum computer. The project opens the path to detailed exploration of a new class of physical phenomena of wide fundamental interest in different areas of physics, while opening new avenues in non-equilibrium solid state quantum systems technology.",2622050,2024,2029,ERC,Slovenia,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
POLarization Orientation CALibrator for Cosmology,"I will enable groundbreaking results for cosmology and fundamental physics, thanks to a novel method for measuring the angle of the polarization plane of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons with unprecedented accuracy. Existing and planned CMB polarimeters looking for primordial B-mode signals need an independent, experimental method for systematics control on the absolute polarization orientation. The lack of such a method limits the accuracy of the detection of inflationary gravitational waves, the efficiency in removing polarized foregrounds, the constraining power on the neutrino sector through measurements of gravitational lensing of the CMB, the possibility of detecting Cosmic Birefringence, and the ability to measure primordial magnetic fields.
My 5-year project will dramatically improve instrumental accuracy by means of artificial calibration sources flying on aerial drones and tethered balloons, within sight of the most advanced ground CMB telescopes, operating at high-elevation angles and far-field distances. The calibrators will make use of linearly-polarized microwave emitters optimally coupled to the Simons Observatory (SO) polarization-sensitive detectors, the world-leading CMB project for the next decade. The orientation of the source polarization plane will be registered to absolute celestial coordinates by star cameras and ground photogrammetry with arcminute accuracy. POLOCALC will take advantage of my leading role in SO, and will operate from its site in the Atacama Desert in Chile. This project will become a pivot for the field: any existing or future instrument in Atacama will be able to observe my novel polarization calibrator, and future projects will intercalibrate their detectors with the resulting calibrated observations of sky sources. POLOCALC will produce the first experimentally-calibrated data of the polarization angle of the CMB and its contaminants, allowing existing and future CMB polarimeters to fully mine the cosmic sky.",2617754,2024,2028,ERC,Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Field Sensors with Exceptional Energy Resolution,"Field-SEER will develop magnetic sensors with combined spatial, temporal, and field resolution beyond what is possible with existing sensing approaches. The “energy resolution” of a sensor describes this combined performance, and determines a sensor’s ability to detect weak, localized and transient signals. In today’s best-developed sensors, the energy resolution is known to be limited by a combination of intrinsic quantum noise and self-interaction effects. Field-SEER will develop sensors that evade such limits, and in doing so establish a new paradigm for extreme field sensing. The immediate fruits of this new approach will be sensors for two exceptionally demanding contemporary applications: First, a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate co-magnetometer will be developed to search for short-range forces predicted by several models of physics beyond the standard model. Second, optically-addressed nuclear spin ensembles will be developed as high-density vapor-phase magnetometers for next-generation magnetic brain imaging. In both cases, orders-of-magnitude improvement are predicted both for the energy resolution and for application-specific metrics. Field-SEER will also study how spin squeezing, predicted to play an important role in these sensors due to their extraordinary coherence properties, can be harnessed for optimal sensing in this new regime of exceptional energy resolution.",2601031,2024,2028,ERC,Spain,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Data Management and Data Science; Quantum Physics
Quantum Metamaterials with integrated atomic-like arrays for quantum information processing,"The key to realizing quantum systems that can implement quantum information processing is entanglement generation between many qubits. For distributing entanglement strong interactions between localized qubits  (atoms) and flying qubits (photons) have to be ensured. The quantum-science community is currently searching for systems that offer enhanced light--matter interaction, as the efficiency of quantum operations in current state-of-the-art systems is limited by the interaction strength and loss mechanisms, which impede the generation of useful many-body entangled states. 
 
We plan to address this challenge by creating quantum metamaterials from quantum-emitter arrays as novel interfaces for generating atom-photon entanglement. Whereas most of the scientific effort focuses on coupling localized qubits to pre-designed structures to enhance interaction (i.e., cavities), we plan to take a completely different approach: building bottom-up quantum optical metamaterials out of quantum particles. We will achieve this by embedding silicon-vacancy-center arrays integrated in a diamond chip, which have shown to be top candidates for entanglement distribution.

We will harness the enhanced collective response of the emitters to light and achieve a quantum response by coherently controlling the emitters' internal degrees of freedom. We will also access never-before-observed long-lived states, which are ideal for quantum memory. Our vision is to implement a scalable quantum light source with many degrees of freedom that generates large-scale atom-photon entanglement. By employing quantum information protocols we developed, our system can generate many-body entangled states applicable to one-way quantum computation. Our system unites major advantages for scaling-up entanglement: 1. High-fidelity quantum control over photonic states. 2. Potential operation-time speed-up by parallelizing photon control. 3. Quantum memory with long-lived states. 4.

Metamaterials for Laminar Flow Control on a Wing,"Achieving extensive laminar flow can reduce aircraft drag by up to 15%, offering breakthrough potential for curbing polluting emissions in aviation and other energy-intensive sectors. To achieve this, wave-like flow instabilities growing in laminar boundary layers need to be controlled and attenuated, to delay transition from laminar to turbulent flow. However, their complex, multi-scale, and broadband nature makes these instabilities extremely challenging to control.

In MetaWing I propose a new disruptive concept for flow control, first born in classical wave physics: Metamaterials. These are engineered composite structures, invoking dispersive wave phenomena to gain exotic properties that go beyond what is considered possible in Nature. The main such property I want to explore is the bandgap, a range in which waves are suppressed when interacting with the Metamaterial. My team and I have recently found key evidence of dispersive wave suppression in boundary layers. However, wave-like flow instabilities have key differences from classical waves, forming a new regime of dispersive wave interactions. Thus, the nature of bandgaps in boundary layer flows remains unclear and unexplored.  

I aim to reveal and understand the formation of bandgaps in transitional fluid flows and use them to suppress wave-like boundary layer instabilities, thus delaying laminar-turbulent transition. To achieve this, I propose the first holistic intersection of Metamaterials and Laminar Flow Control using theory, numerical simulations, novel fabrication methods and state-of-art experimental measurements. 

The combined results will uncover the complex dynamic behaviour of flow instabilities under dispersive interaction with Metamaterials and will help us understand and fully exploit bandgap mechanisms in transitional flows. MetaWing will create a new class of Metamaterials for flow control and pave the way to ultra-low drag wings for the next generation of emission-free aviation.",2569822,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Engineering; Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; Physical Sciences
Lumi SLR: Revolutionising space sustainability through precise and scalable Satellite Laser Ranging,"Commercial opportunities in space are driving an exponential increase in the number of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

Probing the Finely-resolved 100 TeV Gamma-ray Sky for Ultra-heavy Dark Matter,"Dark100 will shine a light into an underexplored dark matter particle mass range. Driven by recent theoretical developments, both in tools and motivation, Dark100 will search for dark matter particles between 100 TeV and several tens of PeV. Leveraging novel, cost-effective telescope technology, Dark100 will deploy an array of telescopes capable of probing dark matter annihilation, improving on the sensitivity of currently operating and planned gamma-ray instruments by an order of magnitude with unprecedented energy and angular resolution.

Dark100 will build a unique dataset of deep gamma-ray observations of dark-matter-rich astrophysical systems. Dark matter will potentially be detected, or in the event of non-detection, limits on its velocity-weighted annihilation cross section will be set. For a non-detection, dark matter will be ruled out for part of the probed mass range and theoretical models constrained for the full probed mass range.

The impact of Dark100 will be felt beyond the dark matter community. By demonstrating a new gamma-ray telescope paradigm, Dark100 will enable a range of possible astrophysical studies with gamma rays above 100 TeV, including searches for Galactic Pevatrons and transient events. Its public data archive will encourage synergy with other gamma-ray instruments.

Dark100 takes advantage of a unique moment in theoretical and technological development that enables its pioneering science goals. While the theoretical motivation is fully developed and the technology is well-tested, the deployment of the Dark100 array and collection and interpretation of its observations is an ambitious project that demands the resources of an ERC consolidator grant.

Geometric Analysis and Surface Groups,"We propose to study links between  curves in flag manifolds, surfaces solutions of geometric partial differential equations in some affine symmetric spaces, and functions on the moduli space of curves. We will consider the relevant energy functions on the moduli spaces of those curves, or on the moduli space of Anosov representations for periodic data, in particular in the context of positivity.  Amongst our concrete ambitious goals are: obtain topological invariant through quantising Anosov deformation spaces, define and compute volumes of Anosov deformation spaces and prove recursion formulae for them, find surfaces in symmetric spaces associated to opers and the relevant higher-rank Liouville action, solve special cases of the Auslander conjecture using foliated spaces.

More specifically, the backbone of this project is to explore a general class of functions on moduli spaces of Anosov representations and, beyond, of uniformly hyperbolic bundles. Then, we propose to identify the family of curves that will be possible asymptotic boundaries -- in the spirit of quasisymmetric curves in the sphere -- the periodic ones corresponding to Anosov representations. We will prove the existence and uniqueness of surfaces bounded at infinity by these curves. Going back, we will consider the area of such a surface, both at critical points on the moduli space, and as a renormalising function allowing to consider volumes of these moduli spaces. Finally, we will consider the space foliated by surfaces  solutions of the asymptotic datum, and define entropy.",2516829,2024,2028,ERC,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Numerical and Computational Mathematics; Pure Mathematics
Effective Field Theories to understand and predict  the Nature of the XYZ Exotic Hadrons,"Two decades ago, the eld of strongly interacting particles entered a golden age with the discovery of exotic hadrons labeled as XYZs. The breakthrough fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of states that appear to lie outside the conventional quark model, although some still require experimental conrmation. The plethora of new states has sparked intense theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks, making it one of the most signicant open problems in particle physics. Despite the progress, unresolved patterns of masses, decays, and transitions above open-avor thresholds persist and have deepened the mystery surrounding these exotics. The intriguing details of production and suppression observed in heavy ion collisions elevated the importance of these studies to probe their nature.
With EFT-XYZ I intend to develop for the rst time, a comprehensive and unied description of these exotics rooted in quantum eld theory, going beyond existing models. On the basis of scales separation, I construct a general nonrelativistic effective eld theory treatment. Scale factorization introduces systematicity and simplicity allowing model independent predictions. The dynamics contained in the nonperturbative low energy correlators is addressed with new and tailored lattice QCD computational tools. By using an open quantum system framework and lattice QCD input, the effective eld theory can describe the XYZ production in heavy ion collisions. EFT-XYZ is poised to make breakthroughs in calculating the properties, dynamics, and interactions of the XYZ in various environments. It holds the promise to unravel the nature of these new states having impact on both experiments and our understanding of strongly correlated systems, with interdisciplinary implications to other elds.

The PIs and graduate students seek to solve, or at least provide significant clues to solving, this great mystery so that the Standard Model can be corrected. In the past, a corrected and improved mathematical description generally has led to new devices and methods of the sort that a technological society needs to advance. Quantum methods will be used to determine whether or not the electron charge is spherical – a measurement of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) – at a 30 times improved sensitivity. The junior members of the team will use this demanding research to hone the science and technology skills that will empower them to contribute to STEM science and education throughout their careers. The huge electric field experienced by a valence electron within a ThO molecule will provide the unprecedented sensitivity. The improvements made using a longer spin precession time and an electrostatic lens should either reveal the eEDM, as predicted by many well motivated models of particle physics that seek to improve the Standard Model, or demonstrate that these models must be unnaturally tuned. EDM measurements are arguably the most promising way to determine whether the new physics in such theories is related to time-reversal violation, which is in turn crucial for understanding the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. A more sensitive eEDM search is one of the few experiments capable of probing new phenomena at energies well beyond the reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). ACME III, proposed here, will be sensitive to a broad class of new physics (sometimes called beyond the Standard Model [BSM] physics) in the 10-100 TeV range. The ACME program bridges a gap between two disciplines in physics: particle physics provides the motivation, while atomic, molecular and optical physics provides the methods.

FRHTP: Advancing Theory for Nuclear Double-Beta Decay (@NDBD),"Neutrinos, the universe's lightest particles, are notoriously hard to detect but nonetheless important. Their unknown properties, including their masses, their interactions with other as yet unobserved particles, and whether they are their own antiparticles could explain why the universe contains so little antimatter. Experiments to observe a process called neutrinoless double-beta decay, in which two neutrons inside an atomic nucleus change into protons while emitting no neutrinos (in contrast to the usual two) can help us learn; the decay can occur only if neutrinos are their own antiparticles, and its rate reflects the properties both of neutrinos themselves and of undiscovered particles they might interact with. What we learn will be limited, however, without a better understanding of what happens inside the nucleus that hosts the decay. This understanding, at a quantitative level with a good estimate of uncertainty, is the FRHTP's goal. The project connects theorists across the country to achieve it, and at the same time provides postdocs with intensive training in several areas at the interface of nuclear and particle physics. It also supplies experiments and information to K-12 students across the country, helping them understand what it's like to work on a cutting-edge scientific problem. The effect of the nucleus on the decay can be summarized in a ""matrix element"" between the initial and final states of a decay operator. Both determining the operator and reliably computing its matrix element are challenges. The operator depends on the particle physics causing the decay, and on the behavior of quarks and gluons inside nucleons. The operator's matrix element depends on the structure of the nucleus, which is made up of those nucleons. Thus, an accurate and precise calculation of the matrix element (a restatement of the Hub's goal) requires coordinated work in particle phenomenology, quantum chromodynamics, and nuclear-structure theory, as well as the use of effective field theory to bridge the energy scales associated with new particles, nucleons, and nuclei. It also requires statistical expertise to combine uncertainties at each of the scales and from several computational methods into an overall error estimate. The Hub uses lattice quantum chromodynamics, three different ab initio nuclear-structure methods, chiral effective field theory, and Bayesian model mixing to produce matrix elements for isotopes used in experiments that are vastly more accurate than anything presented earlier. Bayesian statistical techniques result in a reliable uncertainty estimate, something that has never been achieved before.

CandY: Circumbinary And RockY,"Planets orbiting both stars of a binary system -circumbinary planets- are challenging what we think we know
about how exoplanets are assembled, and how their orbits subsequently evolve. Because they orbit one
another, binary stars disturb the process of core accretion that creates planets. But, instead of changing the
number of planets created, the two stars instead affects circumbinary planets' masses and orbital separations,
thus shining an unexpected light onto which planet formation processes are truly important. With its
ambitious programme, CandY will consolidate circumbinary planets as an unavoidable corner of
exoplanetary science, crucial for the study of planet formation, and the study and interpretation of exoatmospheres.
To better our understanding of planet formation, the CandY project will perform the first systematic study of
circumbinary planets. CandY will develop a suite of new analytical methods, and conduct three ambitious
observing campaigns that will lead to the detection of dozens of new circumbinary planets, including some
all way down to rocky masses. In parallel, the CandY team will study the atmospheric composition of
circumbinary planets for the very first time in order to reveal yet more clues about these exotic worlds.
During the CandY project, we will record every similarity, and any difference between the population of
circumbinary planets and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars. This systematic exercise will
create a leap in our understanding about how planets are produced and which processes dominate planet
assembly and their subsequent orbital migration.
In addition, circumbinary planets have unique orbital properties amongst exoplanets. Their orbital dynamics
boost their probability to experience transits easing exo-atmospheric investigations. Moreover, circumbinary
exoplanets are the only transiting planets for which seasonal atmospheric variations can be studied.",2498727,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Revealing 3D Atomic Structure and Chemistry in Scale-Bridging Volumes via 5D Hyperspectral Electron Tomography,"Electron microscopy is essential to understanding structure-property-function relationships in modern materials engineering, condensed matter physics, chemistry, and structural biology. Yet, due to complicated scattering physics, today’s electron microscopes can only image tiny volumes with 3D atomic resolution. 
Within this project, I will turn the tables by utilizing and inverting the scattering physics to image scale-bridging volumes with atomic detail and chemical superresolution. Combining compressive data-acquisition protocols, state-of-the-art electron optics and detectors, and co-designed computational imaging algorithms will make this possible. 
I will use tomographic experiments and computationally invert the multiple scattering from multidimensional measurements in scanning transmission electron microscopy to determine 3D atomic structure and chemistry in technologically valuable volumes. This has not been realized yet due to significant bottlenecks in the computational complexity of the underlying algorithms and a lack of experimental automation, which I plan to overcome in this project.
The project is divided into three main objectives:
1) Imaging 3D atomic structure in large volumes 2) Visualizing atomic chemistry in scale-bridging volumes
3) Profiling 3D atomic structure, chemistry, and dynamics in controlled in-situ experiments across scales 
These methods will be applied to essential materials, including examining single hydrogen atoms at grain boundaries in structural metals and studying concealed, extensive interfaces in modern semiconductor materials.  In the final phase, I will record atomistic movies of material fracture in tungsten and alloys. Fracture is one of the most critical failure modes of structural materials with catastrophic consequences. The details of crack nucleation and propagation through the breaking of bonds are still largely unexplored and will be measured directly and compared with large-scale atomistic simulations.",2490303,2025,2030,ERC,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Pulsar timing array Inference of the Nanohertz Gravitational wave Universe,"We are on the verge of the next big breakthrough in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy: namely the detection of a nano-Hz GW signal with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Within the next few years nano-Hz GWs will be established as a completely new window on our Universe, unlocking an unprecedented opportunity to unveil its secrets. The signal is anticipated to come from a cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a fundamental, yet observationally missing, piece in the process of structure formation and galaxy evolution. However, alternative Early Universe origins, including backgrounds arising from inflation or phase transitions, cannot be dismissed a priori.
To exploit the scientific breakthrough potential of this new window we need an innovative, robust framework to build our way forward in uncharted territory. A framework that allows us to establish the nature of the nano-Hz GW signal and understand its implications for astrophysics and cosmology. PINGU is this framework; it is a concerted multimessenger project for connecting the GW and electromagnetic (EM) Universe in a novel way. On the one hand, it will leverage on the 15-year long expertise of the PI in PTA observations, data analysis and signal characterization to pin down the properties of the nano-Hz GW signal and characterize its features. On the other hand, it will exploit the most powerful all sky survey and state of the art galaxy formation models to construct a live nano-Hz GW map of our Universe and match it with the upcoming results of PTA observations. This will allow us to exploit the full potential of the nano-Hz GW sky, including: i) establishing the origin of the GW signal and probe its astrophysical nature, ii) gain unprecedented insights into the formation and evolution of SMBHBs and their role in galaxy formation, iii) identify SMBHBs and map their distribution in the Universe, iv) enable, for the first time, multimessenger astronomy in the nano-Hz GW band.",2480443,2025,2030,ERC,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
EVOLVE - Where did life originate from and how does it evolve?,"How did life get started on Earth? Does life exist on other planets? 
How life-threatening are human-induced phenomena such as climate change and virus pandemics? 
These existential questions fascinate the general public and concern politicians. 
Recent advances in several fields of science have led to partial answers, but only an interdisciplinary approach can fully address these questions. 

Our previous Cofund programme oLife has made important advances in understanding the origin and evolution of life, and in the course of this exciting 3 year programme we realized that many more steps should be taken. We therefore propose a new programme EVOLVE, which will appoint 17 doctoral students in (bio)chemistry, (astro)physics and (evolutionary) ecology at the world-leading universities of Groningen and Leiden. The students will carry out top-level research on topics ranging from simulating cell-like behaviour in the laboratory to the future evolution of life on Earth and the suitability of extrasolar planets to host life. 

Besides their research, the students will follow a training programme to learn how to interact with scientists from other fields, and how to connect science to business and policy. They will also learn to follow modern Open Science practices for maximum impact, and to apply diversity & inclusion standards to ensure a socially safe research environment. 
Secondments at commercial companies, non-profit (governmental) organisations and academic institutes will prepare them for careers inside and outside academia. The EVOLVE programme is committed to the EU Green Charter for a sustainable future of our planet.
We will communicate the results of the program to the scientific community, industry, policy makers, schools, and the general public through a variety of targeted media channels.",2473254,2025,2029,European Commission,Netherlands; United States; Germany; Netherlands; Sweden; Netherlands,EU,Philosophy and Religious Studies; Astronomical Sciences
On-Surface Atomic Spins with Outstanding Quantum Coherence,"The quantum nature of a physical system often emerges from its fundamental building blocks and demands a profound understanding to harvest its advantages for quantum devices. Their design requires knowledge about the atomic-scale environment of a quantum object to protect it from noise and energy exchange. For that purpose, spins on surfaces studied and controlled by a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance (ESR) has emerged as an atomic workbench that permits to resolve quantum systems such as single atoms and molecules. However, up to now the coherent properties, in particular the phase coherence time, remain much worse than in other quantum architectures such as nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond or superconducting qubits. 
In ATOMQUANT, I aim to improve the coherent properties of spins on surfaces by several orders of magnitude. The main goal is to create a new atomic-force microscopy (AFM)-based architecture for quantum information processing and magnetic sensing operating on the atomic scale. I aim to achieve this goal i) by improvements in instrumentation: Here, I will set up single spin resonance in a milliKelvin-AFM setup, based on the technique of magnetic exchange force microscopy. ii) by addressing remote substrate nuclear spins and by utilizing them as a highly coherent quantum resource. This will here be realized by 25Mg nuclear spins that are found in the commonly used magnesium oxide substrate iii) by overcoming major challenges for the detection of spins on surfaces such as requirements for low temperatures and hurdles for device integration.
The results of ATOMQUANT will have the potential to bring quantum research to the atomic limit, allowing for exploration of potential qubit systems with outstanding quantum properties in-situ and atom-by-atom. My previous extensive experience in the field of ESR-STM provides the best possible conditions to conduct this innovative high potential research endeavour.",2447450,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Typical and Atypical structures in quantum theory,"Quantum theory, confirmed in numerous sophisticated experiments, is widely believed to describe our world at the micro scale. It is thus legitimate to investigate, which structures are allowed by quantum theory, and which of them can potentially be relevant for developments of quantum technologies.
The basic notion of a quantum state – a mathematical tool used to compute probabilities, characterizing the outcomes of a quantum measurement – is of a primary importance. Furthermore, one analyses quantum maps, which describe how quantum states evolve in time, and quantum supermaps, representing evolution in the space of quantum maps. Assuming that the number of outcomes is finite, all these sets form convex bodies embedded in a real space of a suitable dimension. The case, if the physical system is composed of several subsystems, is of a special interest, as one can analyse correlations and entanglement between subsystems.
  Main goal of this project is to investigate properties of typical quantum states, maps and supermaps, and to identify distinguished, atypical structures with extreme properties, useful for processing of quantum information. We will search for new constructions of absolutely maximally entangled multipartite states, which imply existence of quantum error correcting codes, novel schemes of mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete generalized quantum measurements, which offer optimal measurement accuracy. Moreover, we plan to analyze quantum supermaps with distinguished properties, and study, how these structures behave under decoherence, as quantum features become gradually suppressed.
To put all these structures of the same footing we are going to use generalizations of the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism, which relates quantum maps with quantum states of the extended system, and apply the theory of random matrices to elucidate differences between typical objects with generic features and the atypical ones with desired properties.",2438966,2024,2029,ERC,Poland,EU,Quantum Physics
Revealing the Hidden Universe: A Comprehensive Study of Low-Mass Galaxies Beyond the Local Group,"Low-mass (dwarf) galaxies, with masses under a few billion solar masses, hold significant importance in astrophysics. They are the key objects in challenging dark matter models on small scales, yet considerable uncertainties remain in our understanding of their baryonic physics. Dwarfs also hold important clues on early star formation and chemical enrichment, and on the buildup of galaxies and the black holes within them. However, studying them has been hard – their low surface brightness nature makes them challenging to detect using standard instrumentation and survey techniques. Despite decades of research, our understanding of dwarfs primarily relies on those in our galactic neighborhood, orbiting the Milky Way. Recent technological advances have sparked a thrilling era of rapid dwarf galaxy discovery beyond the Milky Way. I propose a research program using two novel wide-field surveys, capitalizing on instrumentation designed specifically for this purpose to transform three key aspects: (1) With data from the Dragonfly Wide Field Survey, I will perform a pioneering study of galaxies down to the ultra-faint regime well beyond the Local Group. I will also utilize proprietary data from the Merian Survey to construct a sample of 100,000 classical dwarf galaxies at a redshift of z=0.05-0.1. These datasets will establish a solid foundation for understanding the census low-mass galaxies; (2) By combining kinematic measurements and dynamical modeling, I will obtain constraints on dwarf’s dark matter halo profiles, shedding light on core vs. cusp structures, dynamical friction, and dark matter on small scales; and (3) Pinpoint the baryonic processes that shape these galaxies by studying their stellar, gas, and star formation properties. With leadership roles in both observational initiatives, an in-depth understanding of the data, and exclusive data access, I'm uniquely positioned to lead this program, timed ahead of future community surveys like LSST, Euclid, and Roman.",2435588,2025,2030,ERC,Israel,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Implementations and Applicationsof Bosonic Codes,"Quantum error-correction is a critical element for accessing the gains predicted from quantum computers over classical machines. It therefore sits on the scaling path of all candidate quantum computing platforms. At the same time, it represents one of the most remarkable theoretical advances of quantum information: that information stored in apparently fragile quantum states can be indefinitely protected from noise, by providing a stream of low-entropy ancilliary systems. While the initial proposals for error-correction focused on encoding information redundantly in many physical two-level systems, the number of these required is highly dependent on the base error rates of the component systems. A beautiful revelation followed this work, in which it was realized that physical systems with a high Hilbert space dimension already possess the redundancy required for quantum error correction. A prominent example of this approach is found in the use of the bosonic degree of freedom of harmonic oscillators, implemented either in the motional modes of trapped-ions or using confined electro-magnetic fields in superconducting microwave cavities, with the idea that these form a building block with low errors which can be concatenated into a higher level code for quantum computing. The relative simplicity of dealing with single physical systems means that such bosonic codes have produced the first demonstrations of full quantum error correction of a qubit in both implementations. The current proposal builds on this pioneering work to investigate various aspects of how bosonic codes could be operated in the context of larger-scale quantum computing as well as examining their near-term applications in sensing. To drive advances in this field requires a flexible set of viewpoints, as well as experiments which throw up different forms of errors and produce different control constraints. Our proposal will form a nucleus in Switzerland with a unique global dimension, in combining experimentalists in both trapped-ions and superconducting circuits who have pioneered various aspects of bosonic codes, stimulating and stimulated by theorists at the frontiers of error correction and quantum optics. Information from implementing and controlling bosonic qubits will propagate to new proposals for fault-tolerance and quantum gates, while also demonstrating sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. As specific major goals, the project aims to demonstrate the first multi-qubit gates between error-corrected qubits as a building block, design and realize fault-tolerant protocols for bosonic qubits, and investigate new candidate bosonic codes - the critical and squeezed cat codes - which seem to have promising properties for real implementations. It will perform the first logical benchmarking experiments on error-corrected qubits, using these to unveil the nature of residual errors emanating from these novel error-corrected qubits. This will inform the exploration of primitive concatenation schemes for bosonic qubits, thereby paving the way to realizing the first hybrid error correction code, where bosonic encoding and concatenation are combined to produce enhanced error correction capabilities. Finally, we will investigate the use of bosonic qubits as quantum sensors, and produce a proof of principle of an enhanced field sensor using an error-corrected code.These results will not only lead to breakthrough experimental and theoretical results, but most importantly will lay the foundations of a truly scalable approach to a fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computing platform, a paradigm shift in quantum computing.",2425804,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Helium dimer Ultracold Molecules - a platform for fundamental physics and ultracold chemistry,"Laser cooling of atoms has revolutionized physics and allowed studying nature with unprecedented sensitivity, precision and accuracy.  With their additional degrees of freedom, ultracold molecules offer even more.
However, reaching high densities and a high number of elastic collisions are the two major challenges remaining to achieve quantum degeneracy with molecules. 4 molecules were laser cooled and trapped in the last decade, but recent experiments have shown universal loss upon collisions caused by the formation of complexes and therefore preventing further cooling. Although not yet fully understood, the loss is favored by the large state densities of the heavy diatomic molecules used so far.
I propose a novel strategy: HeliUM aims to overcome both obstacles by achieving direct laser cooling of the lightest and first homonuclear molecule He2 and establishing a path towards quantum degeneracy. The light mass of the molecule, absence of hyperfine structure and a restricted set of rotational states due to the Pauli principle, drastically reduce the level density and facilitate evaporative cooling. Additionally, relying on a continuous molecular beam and implementing an innovative slowing technique will lead to densities several orders of magnitude larger than in existing experiments.
With HeliUM, I will provide a controllable, simple 4-electron system at record low temperature, allowing quantum sensing and precision measurements to test quantum physics and the quantum nature of collisions with unprecedented accuracy - while being accessible to highly accurate ab initio computational methods.
By using Rydberg states and photodissociation, HeliUM will put me at the forefront of measuring cross sections for a plethora of reactions involving charged and neutral, atomic and molecular helium species, relevant for understanding He droplets, astro- and plasma physics. This will complement my strong track record in precision measurements of molecular hydrogen and its ion.",2398134,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Illuminating neutron stars with radiative plasma physics,"This research program will use first-principles radiative plasma simulations to understand how neutron stars radiate. Neutron stars are the culprits of the most infamous astrophysical emission enigmas: 1) pulsar radio emission, 2) multi-messenger signals of compact-object binary mergers, and 3) simultaneous generation of giant flares and fast radio bursts from magnetars. These emission mechanisms have remained elusive because we do not have a self-consistent theory that combines plasma physics (describing microscopic motions and energy dissipation of the magnetized gas) and radiative processes (describing the reprocessing of the energy into radiation).

This project combines the forefront plasma physics theory with exascale high-performance computing technologies to achieve two breakthroughs: 1) generation of first-principles 3D models of the radiative plasmas around pulsars, mergers, and magnetars; and 2) development of a novel open-source simulation toolkit for self-consistent and high-fidelity modeling of astroplasmas. These enable a quantitative understanding of the unsolved emission mechanisms (including efficiency, variability, and output spectra) and direct comparison to observations.

Analyzing astronomical observations with these superior physics-constrained models enable direct tests of their validity and a leap in improving the accuracy of the modern nuclear/particle physics theories of the still-unknown neutron star equation of state. The PI has a world-leading role in computational astroplasma physics, an established record of impactful and innovative research in the astrophysics of neutron stars, and 10 years of experience in state-of-the-art high-performance computing solutions.",2393584,2024,2029,ERC,Finland,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Astronomical Sciences
HEROIC - Hop Enabled Realtime Observatory Information and Coordination,"Discovery and telescope follow-up of rare and exotic sources is critical to pushing the boundaries of understanding of fundamental physics. A relatively new capability of combining information from different messengers to more completely understand the universe is called multimessenger astronomy. Multimessenger time domain astronomy is a powerful new tool for exploring the cosmos. The four messengers that astronomers study are light in all its forms, cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Many source types change rapidly with time. It is critical that observations occur simultaneously or within a short time span so that astronomers capture the properties of different messengers before the source changes. The key challenge is coordinating community follow-up across multiple observatories with many instruments, minimizing duplication, and maximizing the value of the combined dataset. Over a 3-year award, a team led by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will build a Hop-Enabled Real-time Observatory Information and Coordination (HEROIC) service. HEROIC will collate, save and publish observatory and instrument status (present, planned, and archival), from a worldwide network of ground- and space-based facilities. Moreover, HEROIC enables teams from smaller institutions to more effectively participate in MMA science. HEROIC will provide the entire astrophysics community a single destination to quickly see what facility can point to a multi-messenger source, what observations are currently being scheduled or undertaken with them, and which groups to coordinate with. HEROIC will be a central component in a fully integrated, interoperable cyberinfrastructure for astrophysics, where scientists can receive alerts, plan and trigger follow-up, and share observations with each other, breaking barriers between previously siloed facilities. The HEROIC service can potentially be extended to all major ground- and space-based facilities. The tools that HEROIC provides are essential for all time-domain astrophysics, and will enable entirely new studies, as scientists will be able to use existing facilities and archival data more effectively, while also encouraging coordination between teams. By developing critical infrastructure that is useful for multiple facilities, HEROIC also frees observatories up from having to develop/maintain similar services themselves, reducing their development burden, and increasing the incentive to participate.

Building blOcks for iOdine thruSTer,"In the last decade, SmallSats (mass <500 kg) disrupted the space market since they allow to access space at a markedly lower cost with respect to medium-to-large systems, and this trend is expected to further grow in the next years. Solid iodine propellant has proven to be an enabling technology to consolidate electric propulsion (EP) in the SmallSat market. Nonetheless, its widespread diffusion is still hindered by issues related to the low maturity of this technology. In order to establish the groundwork for a future standardization and industrialization of iodine-based EP, a modular approach will be pursued in the frame of the BOOST project. Different EP building blocks suitable for different types of thrusters (Grid Ion Thruster GIT, Hall Effect Thruster HET) will be developed and assembled reaching TRL 5/6. A neutralizer based on an optimized RF cathode will be designed such as to be compatible with iodine propellant. A fluidic subsystem conceived for iodine propellant will be upgraded and adapted to the system. Moreover, a tank will be developed in optic of on-orbit servicing. In particular, a smart recharging system will be conceived with cartridges of solid propellant that can be stored into the tank during thruster operations. When the cartridge is completely exhausted it shall be extracted and substituted with a new one by a servicing spacecraft. Once every sub-system is completed and preliminary tested, the overall system shall be integrated for the final verifications. The outcomes of the BOOST project shall not only contribute to paving the way to a future standardization and industrialization of several electric propulsion building blocks but will also lead to a stronger space capacity in Europe, making it more attracting to the international stakeholders.",2354119,2024,2027,European Commission,Italy; Italy; Germany; France,EU,Engineering; Space Sciences
Revealing the secrets of neutron-star interiors with AI and the SKA,"After three decades of planning, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the most ambitious and sensitive radio telescope, finally began construction in 2022. From 2028 onwards, SKA will provide a wealth of new information about the radio Sky with unprecedented detail. A key global science driver is the study of ultra-compact neutron stars, stellar remnants that form when massive stars explode. Combining intense gravity, fast rotation, ultra-high densities, and strong magnetic fields, neutron stars are the ultimate cosmic laboratories to study matter under extreme conditions that we cannot recreate on Earth.

Using the SKA, I will address the question that scientists have puzzled over for more than 50 years: What are neutron-star interiors made of, and how do they behave? SKA's unparalleled sensitivity and the fact that it will detect five times more neutron stars at radio frequencies than currently known plays a revolutionary role in this endeavour.

However, the considerable increase in data quality and scale poses serious challenges. Each signal needs to be carefully studied to extract information about the matter hidden inside the interiors of ultra-dense stars. For this decoding to be successful, we require accurate mathematical frameworks that consistently incorporate physics from the smallest quantum scales to the city-sized extent of the entire star. Moreover, we need analysis methods that effectively and efficiently contrast theory and data. Neither of these crucial components currently exists, hindering our ability to uncover physics in extreme environments.

During this fellowship, I will address these urgent needs by leveraging my interdisciplinary expertise to build a multi-skilled team that transcends traditional discipline boundaries and unites astronomers, physicists, Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts and software engineers. Tackling this work now, while SKA is under construction, is vital so that my team is ready to analyse the telescope's much-awaited data as soon as they become available and drive scientific returns into this global £1.8 billion investment as early as possible.

My first objective is to develop a novel state-of-the-art simulator that rigorously predicts the rotational evolution of neutron stars, which we monitor with radio telescopes such as SKA, to gain unique access to the hidden interior. To this end, my team will follow a multi-pronged approach that will incorporate new knowledge of superfluids (extraordinary fluids in the interiors of ultra-compact stars that flow without friction) and limitations to how we observe neutron stars for the first time. 

Next, I will connect these predictions to observations by utilising recent machine learning (ML) advances. These algorithms learn from examples without being explicitly told how to do so, improve automatically and significantly accelerate scientific discovery in those areas where large amounts of data can no longer be analysed by hand. In short, they are the perfect tool for my team to contrast observations of ultra-compact stars with theoretical models to determine the physics of matter under extreme conditions. 

Finally, my fellowship aims to grow the representation of women and minorities in the software-development workforce. To achieve this goal, my team and I will close a critical gap in the training landscape for Early Career Researchers by designing and delivering new astronomy-based workshops that centre on inclusivity, programming and ML. To make this course freely available online and distribute it worldwide, I will work with the UK's leading body for research software, the Software Sustainability Institute.

In conclusion, as a Future Leaders Fellow, I will open new pathways to interdisciplinary research and drive a breakthrough in how we study ultra-dense stars while setting new standards for inclusive leadership.",2350244,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Investigating Quantum Stereodynamics  in COld REactive Scattering,"It is a long-held dream of physical chemists to explore and ultimately control interactions between individual molecules and atoms at the full quantum level. Crossed-molecular-beam methods combined with recent technology allow for highly-detailed experimental studies of molecular collisions. Yet, achieving fully-controlled reactive collision experiments with predetermined outcomes still remains an immense challenge, requiring control and detection of all relevant reactant and product parameters. Our world-unique crossed-beam setup combining Zeeman deceleration and velocity map imaging would enable us to finally tackle this challenge, when combined with recent cutting-edge technologies. This setup has been used successfully to perform high-resolution inelastic collision studies, and we recently started investigating reactive scattering. 

Here, I propose to perform the first fully-controlled reaction experiment with predetermined outcomes. To this end, I will upgrade our setup to reach collision energies as low as 6 mK, implement laser alignment for manipulating reactant orientations, and employ 3D imaging for detecting product orientations.

To achieve this aim, we will first explore resonances and nonstatistical effects in the prototypical S + H2 → SH + H insertion reaction to demonstrate our ability to reach low energies. Simultaneously, we will laser align H2 molecules and employ 3D imaging in a separate setup to decipher molecular orientation (stereodynamical) effects in collisions involving H2. Eventually, all techniques will be merged for a fully-controlled S + H2 reaction experiment, enabling us to dictate the reaction outcome.

IQ-SCORES promises profound insight into the reaction (stereo)dynamics at the full quantum level and the long-desired power to dictate reaction outcomes with exceptional precision, thus providing an ultrasensitive test for theory. This pioneering and groundbreaking research will thereby truly revolutionize molecular reaction dynamics.",2324998,2025,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Noncommutative ergodic theory of higher rank lattices,"Noncommutative ergodic theory of higher rank lattices is a current topic that has seen several exciting developments in the last five years. Among these recent advancements, in joint work with Rémi Boutonnet (2019), we proved a noncommutative analogue of Nevo-Zimmer's structure theorem for actions of higher rank lattices on von Neumann algebras. First of all, we derived several novel applications to ergodic theory, topological dynamics, unitary representation theory and operator algebras associated with higher rank lattices. Then we obtained a noncommutative analogue of Margulis' factor theorem that provides strong evidence towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for the group von Neumann algebra of higher rank lattices.  These results revealed deep and unexpected interactions between the field of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups and the field of operator algebras. 

In this research project, I plan to build upon these recent achievements to develop new directions in noncommutative ergodic theory of higher rank lattices. This research proposal is centered around two main interconnected themes.

Firstly, I plan to work on several problems and conjectures around the dynamics of the space of positive definite functions and character rigidity for higher rank lattices. These include the classification of characters for higher rank lattices of product type, and more general lattices with dense projections in product groups as well as stiffness results for stationary positive definite functions.

Secondly, drawing inspiration from Margulis' superrigidity theorem, I plan to tackle Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices by developing a novel strategy combining techniques from boundary theory, C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. These methods will lead to new rigidity phenomena for operator algebras arising from irreducible lattices in higher rank semisimple  connected Lie groups.",2316774,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Picosecond superconductivity-driven spin-torques,"Superconducting logic holds the promise of significant improvement compared to traditional semiconductor logic, both in terms of 
computational power and energy consumption, due to the lack of ohmic losses when transferring bits. However, most of these 
advantages are negated by the lack of a suitable cryogenic memory that can be coupled to the superconducting logic. 
The ambition of superconducting spintronics is to develop a superconducting memory by integrating magnetic and superconducting 
elements. Recent discoveries have shown new routes for superconductivity and magnetism to co-operate, enabling new device 
concepts based on the interplay between spin, charge and superconducting phase coherence. This includes the demonstration of 
ultra-low energy magnetic read-out in the superconducting equivalent of a giant-magneto-resistance valve. 

The vision of PICaSSO is to achieve the picosecond switching of a magnet via torques directly originating in the superconducting 
correlation by exploiting two different effects: superconductor-induced magnetic anisotropy and supercurrent-induced spin 
accumulation. To realise this vision PICaSSO adopts time-resolved methods that will photograph the interplay between spins and 
superconductivity in different hybrid magnetic-superconducting structures with a time resolution comparable with their 
fundamental interaction time. This will enable coupling magnets and superconductors at the fastest possible timescale and will allow 
the first study of transient triplet correlation in s-wave superconductors. The research carried in PICaSSO will lay the foundation for 
ultrafast superconducting spintronics and will pave the way towards the full integration of superconducting memory and logic 
devices.",2314521,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics
Ultracold Triatomic Molecules as Quantum Sensors for New Physics,"Our current best model of particle physics, known as the Standard Model, says that the big bang should have created equal quantities of matter and antimatter, subsequently annihilating with one another to leave an empty, featureless universe containing only light. That there is enough left-over matter to form galaxies, stars, planets and indeed us, while we observe almost no antimatter, is known as the matter-antimatter imbalance. This existential anomaly is one of the great outstanding mysteries of modern physics.

Explanation of the matter-antimatter imbalance requires new physics which violates something physicists refer to as CP (combined charge and parity) symmetry. This means that the universe would behave differently if you were to replace all positive charges with negative ones (and vice versa) and simultaneously reflect the positions of all particles about some fixed plane. Many extensions to the Standard Model-proposed to help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry-add new particles and fields at higher energies than so far explored by particle colliders with CP-violating interactions. Whilst direct searches for these particles using higher-energy particle colliders are (at least) many decades away, they can also be detected by the energy shifts they produce in low-energy systems. The higher the energy scale of the exotic new physics, the smaller the resulting energy shifts. Energy levels of atoms and molecules can be measured with precision higher than any other system making them an ideal place to search for the expected tiny shifts. To date, no such shifts have been detected but the best limits on many possible types of CP violation are set by precision measurements of mercury atoms. Other species can have greatly enhanced sensitivity to new CP-violating physics; the same underlying mechanism produces dramatically larger energy shifts than in mercury. In particular, polar molecules have sensitivity ~3 orders higher than atoms and the sensitivity can be enhanced by a further ~1-3 orders of magnitude in systems containing heavy deformed nuclei.

Over the course of this UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship, I will develop a new tabletop experimental platform to search for CP-violating physics using deformed nuclei embedded in ultracold triatomic molecules. These molecules are a near-ideal platform for such a search: (i) the molecules have intrinsic sensitivity to CP-violating physics which is enhanced by 4-6 orders of magnitude relative to mercury (ii) they will be produced at ultracold temperatures, ideally suited to a high-precision measurement, and (iii) the triatomic structure gives them very powerful features to reject many common sources of systematic error in similar experiments.

High-precision measurements require long interrogation times. In the highest precision measurements of atoms, long interrogation times are enabled by trapping the atoms and laser cooling them to very low temperatures; one-millionth of a degree above absolute zero or less. However, the complex structure of polyatomic molecules containing heavy atoms makes the application of laser cooling extremely challenging. Instead, we will produce ultracold triatomics by separately laser cooling a light diatomic molecule and a heavy atom with a quadrupole-deformed nucleus. One particle from each species will be trapped in an array of optical tweezers-highly focussed laser beams which allow trapping and control of single particles. The pairs will then be bound together into triatomic molecules using magnetic fields.

A measurement using this platform, the ultimate goal of the fellowship, will probe for new CP-violating physics at energy scales well beyond those previously explored. Measurement of a non-zero shift will constitute a discovery of new physics, whilst a null result would set stringent limits on the properties that such new physics could have. Either outcome will provide new understanding of the universe we live in.",2313919,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Dosimetry of Ultra-High Dose-Rate Electron Beams at Solid-Water Interfaces in Electron Microscopy: A Key Advance in Hydrated Samples Research,"Electron microscopy (EM) has played a key role in the discovery of many new materials, as well as the elucidation of the role of defect structures and interfaces on material properties and behaviour. Current electron microscopes are capable of maintaining the relevant hydrated state of samples by means of cryofixation techniques or by using dedicated liquid cells. This opens up the possibility of investigating crucial interfaces, such as those in complex aqueous systems that, despite their significance, remain poorly understood. The study of water-solid interfaces in the EM is currently limited by the sensitivity of aqueous samples and interfaces to the action of the electron beam. Knowledge of the fundamental chemical processes induced by interaction with the electron beam is needed for the interpretation of results, prediction and design of experiments and to potentially mitigate electron-beam effects. Here, I propose to develop novel instrumentation and approaches to allow for the direct determination of the yields of radicals and molecules produced as well as reaction kinetics in the EM and at the interface between materials and aqueous solutions. This new concept will permit us to precisely assess the effect of important factors in the radiolysis of aqueous solutions inside the EM such as the very high electron dose rates, the supports, liquid volume, temperature or the effect of nanomaterials’ interfaces. This newly accessible knowledge will lead to the interpretation of numerous EM experiments and will be used to develop novel data-informed adaptive scanning approaches specifically designed for in situ dynamic acquisition with minimal chemical effects in the samples. An important goal of this project is to conceive new predictive models for the radiolytic chemistry produced during EM experiments, which will open the door to the future design of mitigation procedures for radiolysis damage in EM.",2306436,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Enabling spatially-resolved mapping of electric activity in operational devices at atomic-resolution,"""Advanced materials are at the core of innovation in the 21st century for a wide range of industries, including semiconductors, consumer electronics, automotive, and aerospace. Demands for products with increased functionality, performance, and reduced power consumption are driving the need for new device structures and materials. Designing, characterizing, and testing of two-terminal devices such as MIM (metal-insulator-metal) capacitors for high performance DRAM capacitors or MSM (metal-semiconductor-metal) select elements for advanced non-volatile memory are key for improved materials stack design and integration. In ELECTRON, I will develop a technique that allows to directly image """"brain-like"""" functions in operational e.g. RRAM devices. I aim to achieve operando electron beam-induced current imaging (EBIC) inside a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) by using amplifiers to measure electrical currents in a contacted working device exposed to a microscope ́s electron beam, and thus, for the first time map electrical activity of a real device, like neuroscientists use for example, fMRI to track blood flow within the brain: the parts that are being used will light up in the map. This technique will enable a unique and previously non-existent way to visualize electric activity in working devices while being sensitive to electric potential, electric field, work function, conductivity and temperature under simultaneous external stimuli (i.e. heating, biasing, gas). I propose this project based upon the internationally recognized expertise of my group in the development of situ/operando TEM, specifically, the ability to operate and electrically contact stack devices inside an electron microscope and my experience in MEMS-based chip platform design (Nature Communications, 4445(2018)). The goal is to push the spatial resolution of STEM-(SE)EBIC to reach atomic-resolution dimensions while probing industry relevant electronic devices under realistic conditions.""",2254272,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
The SuperCDMS Operations Program,"The nature of dark matter, which makes up nearly 27% of the mass-energy content of the Universe, is one of the most fundamental questions of modern science. The weakly interacting massive particle, or WIMP, is a favored dark matter candidate sought in searches at the Large Hadron Collider accelerator in Switzerland, indirect detection experiments, and direct detection experiments that look for WIMP interactions with nucleons in ultra-sensitive particle detectors. The SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment is a direct detection dark matter search that looks for WIMPs of lower mass with world-leading sensitivity, complementing the on-going global efforts. This award supports the base operations of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment as it commences the first science data-taking of the completed detector. The program includes development of accessible analysis resources that will enhance training opportunities for training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition, computational skills will be incorporated into a diverse outreach effort through short course modules, research projects, and planned workshops. The goal of the SuperCDMS project is to directly detect galactic dark matter and thus address the particle nature of dark matter, its astrophysical properties, and how it relates to the Standard Model of particle physics. The construction of the SuperCDMS detector is reaching completion in preparation for installation and integration at the deep underground SNOLAB sited in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The team will operate advanced cryogenic detectors that have unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles with masses at and below the GeV/c-squared mass scale. The advanced cryogenic detectors will provide unprecedented sensitivity to lower mass dark matter particles, with ultimate potential sensitivity to the dark matter-nucleon cross-section where solar neutrino-nucleus scattering becomes significant. Extending beyond the search for dark matter, the experiment’s phonon-mediated detectors have applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",2236012,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Switching Polytypes and Symmetries by Discrete vdW Sliding,"While the artificial design of pristine crystalline structures and the construction of dedicated periodic playgrounds for atoms and electrons in a solid have transformed our world, much is yet to be explored. I posit that the marvels of van der Waals polytypes should go much beyond and suggest that they offer a remarkable opportunity to rapidly, efficiently, and distinctively swap between numerous different crystals, symmetries, and dispersions at will.
We have recently reported several new crystals made from identical 2D layers that differ only by their stacking symmetry. These perfectly commensurate and periodic di-atomic polytypes result in distinct electric potential steps and exclusive ladder-like polarizations owing to their various combinations of broken inversion and mirror symmetries. Our current research focus is mono-atomic polytypes that break both symmetries and offer further fundamental insight into the purely geometric impact of the atomic positions in the unit cell. Our preliminary experiments on graphitic polytypes detect novel internal polarizations, placing us in a great position to explore its interplay with superconductivity and orbital magnetization.
The key challenge is to break the polytypes out of their commensurate meta-stable stacking and force the layers to slide at particular interfaces, only along armchair lattice orientation and for discrete inter-atomic distances.     
We have recently observed that such switching is possible using external electric fields, but only in the case of polar di-atomic bilayers. The swapping involves a thin incommensurate boundary wall encompassing a single stacking fault, which may slide rapidly in a super-lubric manner.
Building on our ability to construct and distinguish adjacent polytypes, we aim to develop methods to efficiently switch between many distinctive polytypes and properties. With robust nano-meter and nano-second swapping capabilities, we envision ground-breaking SlideTronic technologies.",2231844,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Energetic particles in burning plasmas,"The proposed project addresses elements that influence the physics and control of burning plasmas, i.e. plasmas in which the internal self-heating dominates over the external sources. Such regime is of crucial interest for the international fusion program, including ITER and the demonstration reactor DEMO, as by construction characterizes all power producing fusion plasmas. The project is articulated in five specific, yet interacting and complementary themes, addressing respectively:- the nonlinear dynamics of Alfvén Modes and turbulence in the TCV tokamak, mostly via numerical simulations aimed at unveiling the physics and the possibility of controlling the resonant and non-resonant interaction of fast ions with electromagnetic modes;- the measurement of fast ion dynamics on the TCV tokamak using the FILD diagnostic, a unique measurement method to quantify the consequences, in terms of orbit losses, of the plasma disturbances and the interactions between the fast ions and plasma modes;- fast ions dynamics in the TORPEX toroidal magnetized plasma, to investigate, in a plasma environment that is much simpler than a tokamak, allowing for simpler, more easily controlled and better diagnosed experiments elucidating fundamental aspects of the interactions, and providing a unique platform for code validation; - understanding the interaction between runaway electrons (generated by residual electric field as a consequence of plasma disruptions) and turbulence as well as Alfvénic and kinetic instabilities, providing physics understanding on phenomena that determine the severity of the consequences of plasma disruptions;- the effect of energetic particles on the magnetic equilibrium, a theoretical and numerical effort that is essential for modelling TCV plasmas in the presence of a strong fast particle element either from neutral beam heating or from a runaway electron population, as this requires the capability to reconstruct anisotropic plasma equilibria with plasma flows generated by the beam ions.These themes have in common the relevance to the physics of energetic particles, i.e. individual plasma components whose energy is well in excess of the thermal energy of the relevant species. In fact, achieving and maintaining burning regimes is a must for ITER, DEMO and energy producing fusion power plants, and requires understanding and controlling the dynamics of two populations of these energetic, particles. First, the fast ions, issued by the fusion reactions themselves, in the form of Helium nuclei, i.e. alpha particles, with 3.5 MeV of energy (in a plasma with temperatures of the order of 10 keV), or of the ions that mimic the alphas in present devices, namely those accelerated by neutral beams to several tens, or a few hundreds, of keV, or by radio-frequency waves. In case of TCV, the fast ions are generated by two neutral beams, with energies of the order of 25 and 50 keV, respectively, with MW-power levels. The proposed investigations will advance the state of the art for the prediction of burning plasma experiments in ITER and in future demonstration fusion plants, and provide further elements for better controlling them.Second, fast electrons, referred to as runaways, that are generated at plasma startup or later in the discharge by sudden losses of the plasma confinement, accelerated by residual electric fields in the tokamak to relativistic energies, potentially causing significant damage to the device. Similar physical phenomena to those affecting fast ions characterise supra-thermal electrons in tokamaks. Not only will the proposed studies lead to a better understanding of the complex plasma physics phenomena associated with supra-thermal electrons, but they will provide tools for avoiding, or mitigating the effect of some of the most deleterious transient events that happen in a tokamak fusion plasma, the plasma disruptions, which generate them.",2227404,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Ultrafast control of magnetism with twisted plasmons,"Harnessing twisted light (light carrying orbital angular momentum) on the nanoscale, and its interaction with magnetism, can revolutionize how we encode and process information. In fact, twisted electromagnetic fields can enable a superior control over the motion of the electrons and their spin compared to circularly polarized light. Yet, a clear demonstration that it is possible to act on magnetism using twisted light has still to be established. The main challenge is to find an approach to generate nanoscale electromagnetic fields carrying orbital angular momentum, which can be exploited to drive magnetism with extreme (few nanometers) spatial resolution, at the intrinsic time scale (few tens of femtoseconds) of the fundamental magnetic interactions (exchange and spin-orbit coupling) responsible for the magnetic order in matter. This feature is essential for the development of ultrafast opto-magnetic applications in spintronics, where a major goal is the coherent control of nanoscale magnetic bits. In MagneticTWIST I tackle this challenge and propose the way towards nanoscale control of ultrafast magnetic phenomena by exploiting twisted plasmons, that is plasmon polaritons (light-induced coherent collective oscillations of free electrons in metals) carrying orbital angular momentum and driven by femtosecond light pulses. This strategy will enable a coherent transfer of orbital angular momentum to the electronic spin and orbital degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. In this way, I will disclose new types of light-matter interactions and new kinds of opto-magnetic effects, with a ground-breaking impact on ultrafast magnetism, spintronics and light-driven electronics. Beyond this, MagneticTWIST will open a radically new path enabling to store and process an infinite amount of information on different spatiotemporal levels, impacting also other research fields such as cryptography, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology.",2217044,2025,2029,ERC,Sweden,EU,Quantum Physics
Establishing Dosimetry standards for underpinning FLASH Radiotherapy,"In the last three decades, survival of radiotherapy (RT) patients has greatly improved due to technological advances in delivery of radiation to tumour volumes. However, in spite of improvements in delivery of RT, a significant number of patients still experience severe toxicity from radiation treatment, particularly when the treatment volume overlaps with organs at risk.
It was recently established that ultra-high dose rate (UHDR), known as FLASH RT, leads to remarkable reduction of normal tissue toxicity while maintaining tumour control with respect to conventional dose-rate RT. This so called ""FLASH effect"" was demonstrated in vivo on different animal models and different organs by delivering the total amount of radiation dose in a very short time (usually <200 ms). FLASH RT could represent a paradigm shift in modern radiotherapy with significant benefits for cancer patients and healthcare providers. 
However, the complexity of this new technology and the limited understanding of the underpinning radiobiological mechanisms hamper clinical exploitation. Even though the literature demonstration of the FLASH effect is growing very rapidly, the published studies may lead to flawed interpretation of data due to lack of established dosimetry methods for this new radiotherapy modality. Dosimetry at UHDR is complicated and it is essential to understand the effects that impact detector response in this radiotherapy modality. Without a clear understanding of the fundamental dosimetry issues, there is potential for significant errors and misinterpretation of research results and trials. Accurate dosimetry is crucial for the safe implementation of any radiotherapy technique and ensures best practice and consistency of treatments across different radiotherapy centres. The full clinical exploitation and optimization of FLASH RT requires a multidisciplinary approach to best solve the multiple complex challenges this field faces. The major part of solving these challenges will be through the development of metrology in measurement of dose and dose-rate for FLASH radiotherapy. This will enable validation of treatment planning for FLASH RT, commissioning of the new UHDR delivery systems, demonstration of compliance with safety requirements and support accurate radiobiological investigations.",2206309,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Controllable Quantum Entangled States: Convergence at the Tunability Frontier (ConQuESt),"This project will build a theoretical foundation for the ""tunability frontier"" anticipated to emerge from the convergence of materials physics and quantum engineering. This convergence is driven by two key advances. The first is the ability to engineer ""moiré superlattices"" by stacking atomically-thin layers, leading to new tunable material platforms with unprecedented access to local probes, enhanced electron interactions, and rich topological structure. The second is the development of ""noisy, intermediate-scale quantum"" (NISQ) computing devices that are also exquisitely-controllable simulators of quantum many-body phenomena. Leveraging these developments to fully access macroscopic quantum phenomena and control entangled states of matter will require a holistic framework that combines concepts from condensed matter and techniques from quantum control: the goal of this project.

The project will first develop new directions in moiré systems and NISQ devices, and then use these as scaffolding to explore the convergence of these themes. It will (i) build theories of topological phases of neutral bosons and the interplay of disorder and interactions in moiré systems, motivated by similar questions in NISQ and cold-atom systems; (ii) explore new uses for NISQ devices in studying random systems and noisy non-ergodic dynamics; (iii) develop theories of nonlinear response, inspired by precision atomic and optical spectroscopy, in the many-body, solid-state setting, impacting near-term experiments on quantum materials; and (iv) identify new phases and phenomena that emerge at the tunability frontier, including topological phases at the quantum optics-moiré interface, non-ergodic dynamics in moiré bands, and ""measurement-enriched"" states of matter.

At its close, this project will have built a theoretical framework that will have informed one generation of experiments, and stand ready to steer the next generation to a new tunability frontier of quantum matter.",2201399,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Building Virtual Worlds that Follow Universal Laws of Physics,"Planetary climate models are essential to understanding the climate on Earth while also being windows into the many climates that may exist throughout the Universe. However, current models often fail to simulate planets that diverged from Earth-like conditions as they rely on Earth-centric formulations and suffer a shortage of first principle representations. This severely impacts our ability to understand and predict climate change and evolution, as the physical accuracy of the simulations is compromised.

To solve this current gap in our knowledge, I will lead the development of the first planet climate simulator, Foundation. My central role in developing unprecedented 3D planetary atmospheric models from scratch sets me in an advantageous position to successfully lead this ambitious project. Our goal is to use the building blocks of physical processes we know occur in atmospheres, such as fluid flow equations, moist physics and cloud formation, and build up climate physics in a 3D model that achieves accurate simulations. Our novel model will address climate phenomena that remain unsolved in the Solar System due to current model limitations, namely the nature of Jupiter's chaotic atmosphere, Venus's deep atmospheric circulation and Titan's methane cycle. These are major gaps in our knowledge, even with more than 50 years of spacecraft data.

A model based on Universal physics that can reproduce the most challenging climates of the Solar System is extremely valuable to evaluate Earth's climate model predictions. Our approach can strongly impact the robustness of Earth's changing climate simulations and the prediction of extreme weather events, which are becoming increasingly more critical to our living environment. 

Foundation's greater climate prediction capabilities will also revolutionise exoplanet atmospheric characterisation and provide a thorough theory on the climate stability of terrestrial planets, essential to our understanding of climate diversity.",2200448,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Earth Sciences; Space Sciences
Portal Range Monitoring in Mixed Ion Beam Surgery,"Half of the approximately 4 million annual cancer cases in Europe receive radiotherapy. While many cancer patients have benefitted from technical improvements in recent years, widespread diseases, such as pancreatic and lung cancer, still have dismally low cure rates, with median survival of less than 2 years. Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) offers unprecedented precision in delivering tumour dose, and can be the much needed game changer for these patients. However, CIRT is vulnerable to uncertainties in patient positioning, anatomy changes and organ motion. The current clinical approach is to increase the high dose volume to ensure target coverage, counteracting the primary advantage of CIRT. Novel strategies for image guidance and beam range assessment are crucial to unlock the full potential of CIRT for the best possible patient care.

PROMISE, for the first time, will produce mixed ion beams that enable concurrent treatment and image guidance. Carbon ions deliver the dose to the target while Helium ions, simultaneously accelerated to the same velocity, traverse the patient and monitor tumour location and beam range. PROMISE realizes true portal imaging, providing real-time information on the target anatomy as seen by the treatment beam. Coupled with innovative detectors, AI-based image recognition, and online dose reconstruction, this technique will enable to drastically reduce safety margins, and achieve the full potential of CIRT.

The GSI accelerators are uniquely suited to develop the first mixed beam of Carbon and Helium, along with strategies for their cost-effective translation to existing and future clinical CIRT centres. The method will be validated experimentally in GSI’s former CIRT treatment room. Patient simulation studies will highlight clinical benefit and characterize ideal use cases. A demonstration in an animal model will pave the way for clinical transition. The mixed beam image guidance of PROMISE will lead to a paradigm shift in CIRT.",2164964,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Boundaries of quantum chaos,"Physical systems are both universal and special, depending on the physical property under consideration and the corresponding scale, such as the energy, time, or length scale. From the perspective of quantum dynamics, it has been recently established that the ability of isolated quantum systems to thermalize after being driven away from equilibrium is related to the emergence of universal properties that comply with random matrix theory. Specific indicators for the onset of ergodicity and quantum chaos are related to the statistical properties of energy spectrum, Hamiltonian eigenfunction properties, and the expectation values of observables in these states. At the same time, however, these indicators also carry fingerprints of nonuniversal properties of a given system. Remarkable examples of the latter include, e.g., information on the nature of energy and charge transport, and the scaling of characteristic relaxation times. One of the main conjectures of this ERC project is that these indicators, despite complying with the universal predictions of the random matrix theory, also carry information about proximity of phase transitions. Here we focus on ergodicity breaking phase transitions, which represent a novel type of phase transitions at the boundaries of quantum chaos. We then extend the scope of the project to the critical properties at the ergodicity breaking transitions. We conjecture that they also exhibit certain universal properties, yet likely different from those described by the conventional random matrix theory. The outcome of the project is to establish a phenomenological theory of ergodicity breaking transitions that applies to a broad class of quantum systems, and to clarify the impact of dimensionality, symmetries, the nature of interactions, and other mechanisms on universal properties of ergodicity breaking transitions.",2164964,2024,2029,ERC,Slovenia; Slovenia,EU,Quantum Physics
Next-Generation Light Source:  Driving plasmas to power tomorrow’s nanolithography,"Advanced semiconductor devices are produced using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light at just 13.5nm wavelength. This small wavelength enables patterning the smallest and smartest features on chips. The recent revolutionary introduction of EUV lithography (EUVL) was the culmination of several decades of collaborative work between industry and science – a Project Apollo of the digital age. EUVL is powered by light that is produced in the interaction of high-energy CO2-gas laser pulses with molten tin microdroplets. The use of such lasers however leads to unsustainably low overall efficiency in converting electrical power to useful EUV light: delivering a watt of EUV power at the silicon wafer level currently has a megawatt footprint. Replacing gas lasers with much more efficient solid-state lasers will significantly reduce this footprint. It is currently however unclear what laser wavelength, and what plasma ‘recipe’ should be used. This is because we lack understanding of the underlying complex physics.

MOORELIGHT will deliver the missing insight that is required to efficiently and reliably power next-generation solid-state-laser-driven EUV light sources. (1) We will obtain understanding of phase changes and fragmentation of laser-impacted liquid thin tin targets and develop capabilities for laser-tailoring targets. (2) We will use tailored targets to investigate how these couple to laser light of variable wavelength and spatiotemporal profile to produce hot-and-dense plasma. This will provide insight through experiments and modeling into the optimum plasma recipe for producing EUV light, in tandem with efforts (3) to advance predictive plasma modeling by finding the elusive, atomic origins of the EUV light. Individually, these objectives will significantly impact their related fields of science and technology. Combined, they will enable to sustainably power tomorrow’s EUVL, and help realize the EU’s ambitions regarding its technological leadership in nanotechnology.",2164958,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Quantum Physics
"Entanglement of an array of massive, magnetically levitated superconducting microparticles on a chip","Quantum states of massive objects have fascinated us since the inception of quantum mechanics. Nowadays molecules of thousands of atoms and nanomechanical resonators weighing picogram can be brought into quantum states. This capability enables tests of the validity of quantum mechanics and provides new avenues for quantum technologies. Entangled states are particularly relevant in this context as they unlock multipartite quantum correlations that, amongst others, enable precise measurements beyond the standard quantum limit and novel tests for the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. However, no experiment to date demonstrated entanglement between a scalable number of massive particles, which would access a novel parameter regime in terms of mass, quantum correlation, and particle number. SuperQLev will fill this gap and demonstrate entanglement of the center-of-mass motion of an array of magnetically levitated superconducting microparticles on chip. This achievement will break new ground by exploring multipartite quantum states of massive objects ranging over six orders of magnitude in mass, from pico- to microgram. SuperQLev will make this possible by merging two technologies into a unique experimental platform. The first technology is magnetic levitation of superconducting microparticles, which offers the capability of levitating massive particles at ultralow mechanical dissipation. My group has made pioneering contributions by realizing chip-based magnetic levitation of superconducting microparticles. The second technology is superconducting quantum circuits that offer a versatile toolbox for quantum control. SuperQLev will merge these two platforms to reach quantum control over the motion of levitated superconducting particles via inductive coupling to superconducting circuits. This hitherto unexplored hybrid quantum platform allows SuperQLev to conduct ground-breaking proof-of-principle experiments in quantum sensing and fundamental physics.",2164958,2024,2028,ERC,Sweden,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
BLACK HOLE FEEDING AND FEEDBACK UNIFICATION,"BlackHoleWeather aims to unify the astrophysics of black-hole (BH) feeding and feedback within cosmic structures, in one comprehensive theory that leverages novel high-performance simulations, fundamental gas physics, and timely multiwavelength observations.
   Most of the ordinary matter in the Universe is in the form of a tenuous gas which fills galaxies, groups, and clusters of galaxies (circumgalactic, intragroup, and intracluster medium). Such cosmic atmospheres are shaped by complex thermo-hydrodynamical processes - akin to Earth weather - with the central BH acting as cosmic thermostat over scales of 9 orders of magnitude. We have entered a Golden Age of multiphase gas detections continuously discovering ionized filaments (optical/UV), neutral gas (IR/21cm), and molecular clouds (radio) which condense out of the hot X-ray halos or that are ejected via BH feedback.
   We will tackle key challenges of modern astrophysics: what is the origin and evolution of the macro precipitation; how the multiphase rain (or chaotic cold accretion) is fed down through the BH horizon; how matter/energy is re-ejected back by the BH and deposited via multiphase outflows, jets and radiation; what is the role of dust, turbulence, stars, and cosmic rays; and how the self-regulated BH feeding-feedback loop shapes galaxies throughout cosmic time.
   Bridging BH feeding and feedback via ab-initio, multi-scale (mpc to Mpc), and first-principle physics (magnetohydrodynamics, transport, chemistry, cosmology) is ambitious, yet it is a zero-to-one leap that current astrophysics must undertake, and whose public datasets will provide invaluable legacy for many astronomical communities. BlackHoleWeather is a frontier yet feasible project, exploiting the timely convergence of our groundbreaking massively-parallel GPU code (GAMER2) and our ongoing multifrequency observing programs (e.g., Chandra, XMM, HST, ALMA, MUSE, JWST, SOFIA, MeerKAT).",2164915,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
The Quest for MAGNetIc Fields in A and F TYpe Stars,"Magnetic fields are ubiquitous and have a substantial impact on galactic, stellar and planetary evolution and on life. Theoretical models imply that magnetic fields can affect stars from the deep interior to the outermost layers at each stage of evolution. Yet the origin, geometry and evolution of magnetic fields often remain a mystery. Consequently, standard stellar evolution models do not consider the interaction of magnetic fields with other physical processes.
Extensive surveys show that only 10% of the intermediate-mass A&F-type main-sequence stars have detectable magnetic fields. However, studies show that up to 60% of red giant stars that evolve from these stars have strong internal magnetic fields. Stellar evolution dictates that if the magnetic fields exist in these red giants, they must also exist in younger stars. This discrepancy raises many open questions: Have surface magnetic fields in A&F stars been below the detection threshold of modern instruments? Are their magnetic fields confined to stellar interiors and never penetrate the surface? If so, how may we detect them? Are there physical processes that prevent A and F stars from producing and maintaining stable magnetic fields?
MAGNIFY aims at answering these questions by 1) investigating the existence of internal and surface magnetic fields in A&F stars using asteroseismology and 2) exploring the mechanisms producing magnetic fields by studying stellar spots.  
With asteroseismology, we can use stellar pulsations to probe deep into the stellar interior to detect the presence of hidden magnetic fields. We will use data from the Kepler, TESS and Gaia space missions to study A&F type pulsators and use stellar evolution and pulsation models to disentangle the signatures of magnetic fields from other physical processes. Finally, we will use measurements of stellar spots in a large number of A&F stars to broaden our understanding of magnetic field generation and how it varies with stellar mass and age.",2164895,2024,2029,ERC,Denmark,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Exposing Hidden Electronic Configurations in Atomically Thin Superstructures with Extreme Light,"Light-induced phase transitions in solids present a tantalizing opportunity for controlling the constituents of matter. An intense optical excitation with a duration on the order of femtoseconds can trigger nonthermal electronic and structural configurations, switching the excited material into a hidden phase that may be exploited to realize new technologies such as ultrafast memory devices. A general picture of the microscopic processes underpinning hidden phases has not been established. Their existence has therefore only been exposed in a handful of systems, presenting a major obstacle for achieving on-demand quantum materials with light.

Drawing inspiration from these unique systems, I hypothesize that materials with a strongly correlated phase that is pinned by a two-dimensional superstructure provide a trajectory to a light-induced hidden phase. The objectives of EXCITE are (A) to establish the experimental parameter space to determine the electronic structure of hidden phases in bulk and single-layer correlated transition metal dichalcogenides, (B) to demonstrate the existence of hidden phases in optically excited moiré superstructures that simulate strongly correlated behavior and (C) to exploit the wide tunability of these systems in order to disentangle the general microscopic degrees of freedom that govern the trajectory into a hidden phase.

The objectives will be accomplished by establishing a state-of-the-art experiment to optically excite in situ prepared materials and probe their electronic structure during phase transitions with nanoscale spatial resolution and femtosecond time resolution. These ground-breaking capabilities will be realized by integrating a high-power laser system with my new synchrotron beamline for nanoscale photoemission spectroscopy (nanoARPES) at the ASTRID2 light source, Aarhus University. My experiments will enable me to critically assess basic assumptions in the field and move the boundaries of ultrafast science.",2164859,2024,2029,ERC,Denmark,EU,Quantum Physics
Dipolar superfluid of diatomic molecules and Bose-Einstein condensate of tetramers,"DiMoBecTe will explore the rich phase diagram of a degenerate Fermi gas of polar molecules near a field-linked scattering resonance, including the long-sought dipolar p-wave superfluid of fermionic diatomic molecules, the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of tetermer molecules, and the crossover/transition in between. For this purpose, we will first create a new species of 6Li87Rb polar molecules in the quantum degenerate regime. This new kind of bialkali molecules is promising for its highly tunable interaction and its potential to reach unprecedentedly cold temperature. Both are essential to realize the dipolar superfluid and the BEC of tetramers. Specifically, we will

• Realize a deeply degenerate Fermi gas of new species of 6Li87Rb molecules with flexible control of dipolar interactions via field-linked resonances that was recently demonstrated in my group.
• Realize and explore dipolar p-wave superfluids featuring anisotropic pairing with non-zero angular momentum in polar molecule systems.
• Realize and explore the Bose-Einstein condensate of tetramers which exhibits both strong dipolar and quadrupolar interactions, including the crossover/transition from a dipolar superfluid to a tetramer BEC.

We propose DiMoBecTe at an exciting time when degenerate Fermi gases of polar molecules have finally become available in experiments, including degenerate NaK molecules attained in my group. It will provide a brand new platform to understand and design unconventional p-wave superfluidity with highly controllable interactions, and to realize Majorana modes in polar molecule systems and therefore pave the way towards topologically protected quantum computation. Furthermore, it will, for the first time bring polyatomic molecules into the quantum degenerate regime by creating a BEC of tetramer molecules.",2164820,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
3D Cuprate Twistronics as a platform for high temperature topological superconductivity,"2D superconductors can be used to build ultra-clean interfaces for Josephson junctions, the superconducting analog of a transistor. A small twist in the relative crystal orientation of 2D superconductors could become a new platform for topological superconductivity, an exotic state of matter that holds great promise for quantum computing at high temperatures. Based on my methodological developments for the realization of twisted cuprate ultra-clean interfaces, the field is rapidly evolving, and these interfaces are now the leading candidate for the implementation of high-temperature topological superconductivity. However, the combination of well-controlled twisted cuprate heterostructures and complex circuits calls for new experimental methodologies.

3DCuT will develop micro/nanodevices and techniques to fabricate and control cuprate van der Waals twisted heterostructures in three-dimensional nanoarchitectures: 1) We will develop novel fabrication tools to integrate complex thermal and superconducting circuits in fragile twisted cuprate bilayers. We will explore if a topological gap opens near ´magic´ angles in twisted bilayers by studying the Josephson effect. 2) We will fabricate trilayers cuprate heterostructures with different twist angle symmetries, where the topological gap is amplified and time-reversal symmetry broken states appear across a wide range of angles. 3) We will create a heterostructure between a superconducting cuprate twisted heterostructure and a topological insulating crystal, allowing us to create a chiral Majorana edge mode. At the end of this project, we will have provided a brand-new solid-state tool for emerging quantum technologies in computation, metrology, secure communication, single-photon imaging, methodologies for the entire field of 2D materials, and a comprehensive understanding of the governing principles and ingredients for topological superconductivity at high temperatures.",2164656,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Condensed Matter Physics"
the Onset of Prebiotic chEmistry iN Space,"The question of the origin of life has intrigued human beings for centuries. Life appeared on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago, but we ignore the process that made it possible. Recent theories propose that primitive Earth was a huge chemical reactor where a high diversity of precursor components progressively turned into primordial metabolic, self-replicating, and membrane-bounded systems. The origin of these components is debated. They could be formed endogenously or exogenously. It is remarkable that life appeared on Earth soon after the arrival of tones of extraterrestrial organic material on its surface by the impact of meteorites and comets and thus, exogenous delivery is considered a decisive step in the origin of life. This idea is supported by the detection of amino acids, nucleobases and sugars in meteorites and comets. It has been proposed that the chemical composition of comets could be inherited from the parental, interstellar molecular cloud core. But what molecules of prebiotic interest can be formed in interstellar space? And which ones could be inherited from the initial conditions of star and planet formation?

OPENS is an interdisciplinary project that will discover what prebiotic molecules are present in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are inherited by Solar-system precursors. Our novel approach integrates astronomical observations, laboratory experiments of ices, quantum chemical computations and theoretical modeling. This project is very timely since it will exploit ultra-sensitive, broadband spectral surveys recently obtained with IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m, and data from ALMA and JVLA large programs and from a JWST ERS project. The detection in the ISM of the prebiotic compounds essential for the emergence of life, will pave the way for future laboratory studies in prebiotic chemistry, and will have important implications for our understanding of how life could originate on our planet and how likely it is to emerge elsewhere in the Universe.",2164549,2024,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Next Generation Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral (Quapi) Methods for Condensed Phase Quantum Dynamics,"The inevitable interaction of a quantum system with the environment leads to energy relaxation and decoherence which can result in novel phenomena and opportunities not present in isolated quantum systems. Of particular interest is the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics subject to non-Markovian memory and at strong interaction with the environment. In such situations, novel and generally applicable computational methods are necessary for precise and reliable simulations of the many body dynamics of open quantum systems.
 
For this purpose, a hierarchy of methodological developments is proposed within the framework of the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (Quapi) method that address (i) the generalization of the method to more complex environments, (ii) its numerical efficiency and scalability, and (iii) employ neural networks to leverage algorithm performance. Finally, (iv) a quantum algorithm-based strategy is pursued for accelerated numerical propagation algorithms on near-term quantum devices. The hierarchy of developments facilitates simulations of condensed phase quantum dynamics for more complex systems and ever complex environments to address highest relevance open questions and research objectives in the understanding of condensed phase quantum dynamics, specifically, if the interactions of a system with its environment potentially can affect the system’s coherence, the underlying mechanisms leading to complex many body phenomena and the possibility of control of the system dynamics and its decoherence.
 
Ultimately, the algorithm developments and novel conceptual approaches will yield a comprehensive numerical path integration software platform for condensed phase quantum dynamics simulations that has groundbreaking potential by facilitating extremely challenging simulations that are not yet possible on classical computers or only envisioned on tailor made quantum devices.",2164426,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Quantum Physics
Early Build-up of Ringed Planet-Forming Disks,"With one planet per star on average, planet formation must be a robust process. Yet, surprisingly, we still do not fully understand how planet formation works. Current models for planet formation usually assume pre-existing smooth disks and homogeneously distributed planetesimals of arbitrary composition. In contrast, recent results highlight the crucial role of early stage disk sub-structure, inhomogeneous accretion, and carbon depletion processes on the final planetary systems. Until now, adequate techniques to model these dynamic, complex systems in a computationally cost-efficient way were lacking.

The overall aim of EARLYBIRD is therefore to overcome this bottleneck and track the planet-building material and its composition through the initial formation of disks into the populations of planetesimals and planets and to reveal in which ways these processes are observable in older disks and exoplanets. The project concretely will 1) determine the global effects of streamers/sustained infall on early evolution of disks and planet formation, 2) study how outbursts and dust evolution interact and determine the effect of high dust-to-gas ratio infall on planetesimal formation, 3) track compositonal changes (e.g. carbon, CO, water) during planet formation and 4) decipher the observable properties all these scenarios imprint in the distribution and composition of small dust, planetesimals, and planets.

Based on my pioneering work on disk particle growth and transport, EARLYBIRD will utilize highly innovative 3D modeling techniques, which are unique in being calibrated against full coagulation models and still are two magnitudes faster than a full solver. The project will thereby not only enable me to fully exploit the information imprinted by the disk formation stages on planet formation, but also pave the way for cost-efficient 3D-modeling of dynamic systems in neighboring fields.",2164154,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Space Sciences
Engineering QUAntum materials for TErahertz applications,"I propose to demonstrate a novel design paradigm for terahertz (THz) technologies, which places the ultrafast thermodynamic properties of quantum materials at the heart. Approaches with conventional semiconductors and metals, as well as recent attempts with two-dimensional materials, typically aim to exploit the optoelectronic properties of materials towards developing THz components and systems. This has so far not led to the desired breakthrough that the, currently still underdeveloped, terahertz regime so greatly needs.  The vision of this project is that the truly game-changing potential of quantum materials for THz applications lies in their exceptional ultrafast thermodynamic properties: Quantum materials, such as graphene and topological insulators, have giant thermodynamic THz nonlinearities, and generate ultrafast and efficient THz-induced thermoelectric photocurrents. They can be combined with photonic structures into quantum metamaterials with strongly enhanced light-matter interaction, and are compatible with established electronic and photonic technologies. Exploiting these and more remarkable properties, we will demonstrate THz emitters, nonlinear THz convertors, and THz detectors - all based primarily on thermodynamic design principles. These will outperform currently available THz components on several fronts, and establish quantum materials as the ideal material platform for integrated THz photonics with novel capabilities.  Specifically, we will focus on a combination of quantum materials that are relatively well understood, and novel material systems that are promising yet less well understood. As a result, we expect major impacts both on a fundamental level in terms of understanding ultrafast thermodynamic phenomena, and on an applied level in terms of engineering these thermodynamic properties towards concrete THz technologies. The ultimate goal is to unlock the full potential of the THz range and bring utility and benefit to society.",2164140,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
The origin and evolution of a blastered Mercury,"Mercury is a metal-rich planet from which Earth-based and spacecraft data were collected. Our understanding of its interior structure and thermochemical evolution is however still relatively poor. This is due to: (1) large uncertainties on its polar moment of inertia and surface composition; this will be largely improved by the BepiColombo mission; (2) an unknown bulk-planet composition; and (3) a poor knowledge of some key thermophysical properties (e.g. phase stability, temperature, density) of solid/liquid metals and silicates inside Mercury. This is because under Mercury’s reducing conditions, elements behave differently than on other planets. Currently available phase diagrams for the Moon and Mars are thus irrelevant for calculating the compositions and physical properties of Mercury’s core, mantle and crust. Improving such constraints is critical but requires new experiments under hitherto unexplored conditions; they will be done in IronHeart.
So far, it was largely neglected that many compositional features of Mercury are inconsistent with its direct accretion as a small, metal-rich planet. IronHeart’s working hypothesis is that Mercury is merely the remnant of a larger, Martian-sized, chondritic planet (which we call proto-Mercury) involved in collisions having stripped away much of its mantle. This process did eventually set the final composition of modern Mercury. For the first time, IronHeart will evaluate experimentally how proto-Mercury controlled the core and mantle compositions of modern Mercury. Further experiments on these compositions will provide phase equilibria of Mercury’s internal layers allowing us to calculate their thermophysical properties. By combining those with BepiColombo data into thermal and geophysical models, we will provide a clearer than ever picture of Mercury’s structure and evolution. IronHeart will also be critical to understanding dense exoplanets and the Earth, which accreted from similar building blocks as Mercury.",2164120,2024,2029,ERC,Belgium,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Space Sciences
Gravitational Physics from the Universe Large Scales Evolution,"How does gravity work on cosmological scales? Starting from July 2023, for the very first time in the history of space science, the geometry of the Universe Large Scales will be mapped by the Euclid mission, providing the scientific community with a wealth of cosmological data of unprecedented quantity and quality. It will be a transformational moment that will open a new ground for testing gravity; yet, unless combined with a theoretical framework able to translate wonderful numbers into concepts, this is bounded to be a missed opportunity. This research program - whose proponent is currently serving in the role of co-Lead of Euclid Theory Working Group - aims at constructing such a framework.
Euclid will compare the action of gravity on light with that on non-relativistic particles, in a regime vastly different from where General Relativity has been confirmed. Any significant detection of a deviation, will have profound consequences. But how to confidently dissect and decipher these potential signals? In the past years I have laid the ground work for cosmological tests of gravity, culminating recently in a first reconstruction of gravity from available data. These results are at their infancy and a leap beyond the current state of the art is urgently required to breach into the smaller, nonlinear scales where statistical errors will be at their lowest. The timing could not be better, with data releases of Euclid expected during the tenure of this proposal.
From an exhaustive exploration of the gravitational landscape under criteria of theoretical viability, we will create predictions of the Large Scales phenomenology by broad classes of theories, with an accuracy that meets Euclid requirements. These will be used to construct a comprehensive phenomenological framework extending into the nonlinear regime and inform bayesian non-parametric reconstructions of gravity from the latest data. As a result, we will provide a completely new view into gravity on Large Scales",2164118,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF FLUCTUATING TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS IN ACTION,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials are unique platforms for studying fundamental science. They bridge the gap between the world of atomic scale dynamics and the world of macroscopic mechanical vibrations. Owing to their small size, they can enable exploration of research areas that lie at the forefront of classical and quantum technologies. But at the same time, their noisy and nonlinear nature limits their performance. This combination of fluctuations and nonlinearities brings to light a new regime of mechanics that has remained largely untapped, and that, if well-understood, can open a wide range of trajectories in high-performance sensing and lab-on-a chip devices.
NCANTO aims at elucidating this strong interplay between nonlinearities and noise at the atomic scale, and will leverage the acquired knowledge to engineer 2D nanomechanical devices that (i) offer extreme frequency stability, and (ii) enable robust and highly-sensitive single-cell sensing. To realize this vision, I will explore the influence of a range of nonlinear dynamic phenomena on two important noise sources, namely frequency fluctuations and biological noise. My approach will combine state-of-the-art modelling and experimental techniques to deliver novel designs that utilize nonlinear dynamic phenomena at their core. These designs will quench frequency noise in 2D resonators for breakthrough performance on the one hand, and will enhance biological rhythms at the single-cell level for robust drug screening on the other. By linking stochastic dynamics, nanomechanics, nonlinear dynamics and structural optimization, I will develop a multidisciplinary research area that will enable a ground-breaking leap forward in the utilisation of 2D materials as nonlinear sensors in frequency-based metrology and bio-health. NCANTO will thus not only herald new frontiers in nanomechanics but will also open new routes towards engineering nanotools for rapid screening tests in drug development and personalised medicine.",2163905,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Engineering; Quantum Physics
Tidal Disruption Events: A New Black Hole Census,"Massive black holes (MBHs) are key players in high energy astrophysics, galaxy formation and evolution, and astroparticle physics. Despite their centrality to astronomy, we still cannot answer basic questions about MBHs. What are their origins? How have they grown over cosmic time? What are their current demographics? To answer these questions, the project will turn tidal disruption events (TDEs) from curiosities into reliable probes of MBH parameters. 
A TDE occurs when an unlucky star passes too close to a MBH and is ripped apart by tidal forces. The ensuing fallback of debris powers a highly luminous, potentially multimessenger flare. TDEs are, in principle, ideal probes of MBH properties. Unlike standard techniques for measuring MBHs, TDEs (i) happen in all galaxies, (ii) are visible to cosmological distances, and (iii) involve very few free parameters. But the theoretical picture of TDEs remains confused, as the large dynamic range of TDEs has prevented ab initio simulations to determine how tidal debris evolves and radiates. At present, there is no consensus on the geometry or even the power source of observed TDE flares, making robust parameter estimation impossible. I will solve these open theoretical questions, capitalizing on my recent pilot study that for the first time ever simulated a typical, first-principles TDE.
This project will deliver (a) first-principles simulations of the evolution and emission of TDEs; (b) idealized but accurate models of TDE light curves and spectra suitable for parameter estimation; (c) a first-ever sample of MBH parameters derived from fitting ab initio models to TDE observations. I will use these results to sidestep the limitations of other MBH measurement techniques and to place unique constraints on the formation and growth history of the smallest MBHs. This work is urgently needed in light of upcoming all-sky surveys such as ULTRASAT and LSST, which will expand the TDE sample from dozens to thousands in the mid-2020s.",2163610,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Impact of foreshock transients on near-Earth space,"This project addresses major open questions in plasma physics: the dynamics of collisionless shocks, their impact on the downstream medium and particle acceleration. Collisionless shocks are powerful particle accelerators, ubiquitous in astrophysical plasmas. Recent works suggest that the dynamics of the shock precursor, or foreshock, contributes greatly to shock acceleration. Here we use near-Earth space as a natural laboratory to quantify the impact of transient kinetic structures forming in the foreshock. These foreshock transients are particularly intriguing because in addition to contributing to acceleration at the shock itself, they impact geospace as a whole in driving swift, intense wave storms in Earth's magnetosphere. In this proposal, I present recent data revealing that these waves accelerate energetic electrons in Earth's radiation belts, connecting for the first time the dynamics of two major acceleration sites at Earth. This issue has never been explored because of considerable challenges: multi-point in situ observations and global kinetic simulations are needed to unravel the complex processes at work. The WAVESTORMS project makes full use of recent advances on both of these fronts to resolve the impact of foreshock transients on near-Earth space in a holistic manner. Using a flagship kinetic model of the global magnetosphere and high-fidelity space- and ground-based measurements, we will (1) fully characterise their interaction with the shock and their contribution to shock acceleration, (2) quantify the radiation belt response (acceleration and losses), (3) connect our findings to the solar wind context, to finally (4) quantify their global impact on near-Earth space. My expertise in foreshock physics and in combining multi-mission data and cutting-edge simulations puts me in a unique position to lead this project. Our results will constitute a breakthrough in our understanding of near-Earth space dynamics and particle acceleration in general.",2162888,2024,2029,ERC,Finland,EU,Engineering; Space Sciences
Majorana zero mode control and detection platform,"The non-abelian state of matter has not been experimentally confirmed and remains an important field of research. Its detection and manipulation are critical in order to develop a coherent quantum computer in the future. The overarching goal of this proposal is to build a working topological qbit based on the braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). But there are two main challenges. The first is to create a 2D environment where such states can be adiabatically spatially exchanged, while the second is to detect the presence and the evolution of such a state. To overcome these challenges, I will combine two novel techniques that are currently not widely available: (a) the SQUID-on-tip (SOT) magnetic and thermal microscopy and (b) a platform to manipulate vortices at the nanoscale that was developed by my research group. The research will focus on the MZM, which is one of the candidates for a non-abelian state. In particular, I will consider MZMs predicted to be localized at the center of vortices or skyrmion-vortex pairs (SVP). The project has three work packages: (1) develop a novel platform for vortex and skyrmion manipulation, including the integration of a charge detector to detect the vortex charge in trivial vortices. (2) Investigate different materials and their related heterostructures that could host MZMs at the center of vortices or SVP. These materials include FeTeSe and heterostructures, such as strong spin-orbit semiconductor/superconductor, ferromagnets/superconductors. (3) Combine the results from WP1 and WP2 to detect the presence of MZMs. This includes gapless edge state and fractional vortices detection using the SOT, and charge sensing developed in WP1. This ambitious project has the potential to revolutionize quantum computing and quantum materials physics. By enabling new experiments, it will establish a new field where 2D exchange statistics can be directly controlled and observed.",2162254,2025,2030,ERC,Israel,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Probing Gauge Symmetries and  Gauge-Matter Interactions  using Tensor Networks,"We are in the midst of the second quantum revolution. Highly entangled quantum matter is being discovered, engineered, controlled and probed across a wide range of scales and conditions; quantum platforms are being used to emulate other quantum systems. The ability to simulate the quantum world on classical computers has been instrumental in guiding, validating and diagnosing these exciting developments. As the quantum world is probed beyond regimes of weak coupling and near-equilibrium, novel computational methods are required that can faithfully parameterise the peculiar entanglement patterns of physical quantum states in a scalable manner.  The central goal of GaMaTeN is the design and application of tensor network methods for studying quantum lattice systems with gauge symmetries, the universal paradigm that governs high-energy particles as well as low-temperature condensed matter. A computational framework will be developed for targeting interacting gauge and matter degrees of freedom in conditions that are beyond the reach of the ubiquitous Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Equilibrium properties of phases with high baryonic densities as well as non-equilibrium dynamical effects such as the phenomenon of string breaking or the spontaneous particle production in strong external fields will be investigated. At the conceptual level, a unique entanglement perspective on the non-perturbative real-space scaling behaviour of gauge theories will be provided. Furthermore, the advancements in this proposal are essential in order for tensor networks to uphold their instrumental role in assisting and benchmarking future quantum simulation proposals and experiments.  The tensor network algorithms developed in the GaMaTeN project will be optimised for high performance and will maximally exploit symmetries. They will be released as a general-purpose open-source library, which offers the potential for a lasting impact far beyond the scope of this proposal.",2162253,2024,2029,ERC,Belgium,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Mercury in the solar wind: adaptive kinetic model for space weather at solar system's innermost planet,"""We develop a new type of a global plasma simulation model with adaptive charged particle kinetic physics for the Mercury-solar wind interaction. Mercury’s solar wind interaction, or space weather, is unique in the solar system due to spatially small and temporally fast magnetospheric scales, airless solid body with a large conducting core, a tenuous surface-originating exosphere and the closest distance to the Sun of the planets. These features mean that Mercury is an ideal """"compact-sized magnetospheric solar wind interaction laboratory"""" for spacecraft and model studies compared to Earth's much larger magnetosphere. Since Mercury's plasma environment is populated by a unique composition of exospheric heavy ions mixed with the solar wind, the magnetosphere is much smaller than at Earth and under stronger solar wind conditions, studying Mercury reveals new information on space weather processes in general. The main scientific objectives of the BepiColombo (BC) two-orbiter mission en-route to Mercury include the investigation of the structure and dynamics of the Hermean magnetosphere and exosphere. The new model to be developed in this project is based on high-performance computing and an adaptive algorithm for charged particle kinetic effects. This enables efficiently resolving Hermean space weather processes and the coupled, complex solar wind-magnetosphere-exosphere system at detail beyond current global models. The new model is applied in the interpretation of observations by BC with the focus on the role of charged particle effects in the physics of basic space weather processes.""",2161823,2024,2029,ERC,Finland,EU,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Magnetic alloys and compounds for ultra-high harmonics spin current generation,"Limiting power consumption for massive data while increasing data processing speed and transfer rates requires the development of innovative architectures for logic, memory, and hyper frequencies applications. Spintronics brings some answers proposing solutions based on spin-orbit coupling. However, there is still a need to further reduce power consumption, simplify memory architectures, and close the THz gap. I propose unconventional experiments to develop magnetic-based platforms towards sub-THz spin current generation without the use of laser sources and gain access to the study of magnetic materials with high resonance frequencies.
I formulate here new challenges presenting cutting-edge concepts involving spin-orbit coupling in magnetic alloys and compounds with magnetic Rashba interfaces. These will allow exploring and exploiting the ultra-high harmonics generation of spin currents, spin-orbitronics signals, in the sub-THz domain by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange and Rashba splitting.
Based on these innovative concepts, MAGNETALLIEN has a twofold objective: i) to demonstrate that magnetic alloys and compounds, such as amorphous ferrimagnets and magnetic epitaxial Heusler, that possess strong spin-orbit coupling will lead to a new platform for efficient spin current self-production and, ii) will lead to the production of ultra-high harmonics spin pumping voltage up to tens or hundreds of GHz enabling various uses in new spin-orbitronics experiments. 
MAGNETALLIEN project will generate knowledge in spin current self-production and self-torque in magnetic alloys and compounds that will allow making decisive progress for less-energy-consuming architectures. Although of fundamental nature, demonstrating the existence of ultra-high harmonics signal which exploitation in innovative devices for spin-orbitronics goes far beyond the state of the art, this project will open new avenues and perspectives to tackle in a disruptive way all-electric sub-THz domain.",2161228,2024,2029,ERC,France; France,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
The Holographic Bootstrap,"The holographic principle is believed to embody key fundamental features of any quantum gravity theory. It can be seen as a profound consequence of the intrinsic tension between the definition of quantum observables and the fact that in a theory of gravity it is impossible to define such observables in any finite volume due to the existence of Black Holes. The aim of this project is to push the boundaries of the holographic principle beyond AdS space, formulating a set of self-consistency requirements in dS, flat and inflationary backgrounds directly at the level of the sought-after holographic observables. If successful, this will allow us to understand the basic model independent principles at the basis of a quantum gravity theory and to check if a result of a calculation is consistent with unitarity and causality  providing a paradigm shift in the search for consistent quantum gravity theories. The bottom-up perspective developed by HoloBoot will also be centred on phenomenological applications, ranging from classifying model-independent properties of consistent gravitational EFTs to understanding signatures of new particles during Inflation.",2160898,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Super-resolution Field-Resolved Stimulated Raman Microscopy,"The next generation of biological imaging will be a movement towards super-resolution, label-free approaches to visualize subcellular structures in a nonperturbative, non-invasive manner. In this proposal, a super-resolution, label-free, Raman microscope based on a novel, ambient-air, field-detector is envisioned to fulfil the requirements of these exciting prospects, essential for biomedical advancements. By employing bright, ultra-broadband, femtosecond electromagnetic forces at petahertz frequencies, Raman molecular vibrations are driven coherently and efficiently. Temporal confinement of the excitation pulses to a few femtoseconds allows for temporal filtering of the molecular response and therefore, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and high detection sensitivity is achieved. The same laser provides optical pulses with ultrashort duration to directly access and detects the field oscillations of the emitted Raman molecular response. This novel detection metrology allows for simultaneous and broadband detection of the entire molecular fingerprint and beyond with high dynamic range and sensitivity down to quantum shot noise. Most importantly, due to the near-field imaging in this scheme super-resolution, chemically sensitive images can be constructed without the need for labeling molecules or using structured light. The advanced near-infrared femtosecond source in combination with the novel field detection technology will enable acquiring the complete fingerprint of complex biological molecules non-invasively with a spatial resolution and sensitivity exceeding that of any previously demonstrated method, for the first time. The next generation of laser-driven biological microscopy requires a dramatic leap in sensitivity, dynamic range, spatial resolution, and non-invasiveness; this proposal represents a coherent, achievable approach to fulfilling this need opening up new horizons for fundamental studies in science to see beyond the visible.",2160898,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Strange nuclear matter from first-principles hadron scattering amplitudes,"StrangeScatt will assess the role of strange quarks in nuclear physics by performing first-principles computations of scattering amplitudes to study interactions between hadrons with strange quarks. The presence of strange quarks alters the properties of atomic nuclei and nuclear matter. For instance, the relationship between the mass and radius of neutron stars depends on the dynamics of strange quarks produced in their core. However, quantitative predictions of neutron star masses and radii are complicated by our ignorance of the fundamental interactions of baryons with strange quarks (hyperons). Such predictions are timely given the advent of dedicated neutron star observatories, multi-messenger astronomy, and earth-based experiments involving baryon resonances and nuclear matter.
         Nuclear interactions are rooted in QCD, the fundamental force which binds quarks inside hadrons and hadrons inside nuclei. The bridge between few-body and many-body dynamics is made systematically with effective theories of the strong nuclear force, which require as input few-hadron scattering amplitudes as well as their quark-mass dependence. This project will compute two- and three-hadron scattering amplitudes between nucleons and hyperons directly from QCD using high-performance computer simulations on a space-time lattice.
         Lattice QCD computations of scattering amplitudes have improved markedly thanks to algorithms developed by the PI, so that accurate and precise first-principles computations of are finally within reach. The unique ability of lattice computations to vary the up, down, and strange quark masses near their physical values is necessary for fully predictive effective theories. The PI's experience in lattice QCD computations of scattering amplitudes makes him ideally suited for StrangeScatt, which supports ground-based experiments and astrophysical observations by probing the role of strangeness in hadron interactions, nuclei, and nuclear matter.",2160777,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Beyond-classical Machine learning and AI for Quantum Physics,"A primary challenge in quantum computing (QC) is finding its ideal application, i.e., an essential problem with the largest advantage of quantum over classical computing.  To resolve it, I propose to focus on the notoriously complex area of quantum many-body systems. This project will characterise which quantum many-body problems, in various physics domains, allow for significant quantum advantages even over any future machine learning, data-driven methods. By exploiting my pioneering research in this area, I will also develop new quantum machine learning (QML) methods to solve them better than classically possible, using a two-stage approach.

In the first stage, we will develop the project's theoretical foundations. My recent works on quantum-over-classical learning advantages provide the starting points for the development of new mathematical machinery which facilitates the proving of quantum advantages in selected many-body settings. In parallel,
building on circuit-decomposition methods I recently developed, we will elucidate the role of quantum phenomena in QML in order to design new QML methods which can be better tuned to quantum many-body settings. 

In the second stage, we will identify suitable concrete quantum many-body problems with substantial real-world interest, apply the newly designed high-performing quantum learners, and formally prove learning advantages using the developed theoretical machinery. 

The positive results of the project will resolve some of the main open problems in QML and will have a major impact on both QC theory and aspects of foundations and applications of QML. In our search for the best application, we will consider many-body problems from diverse areas of physics: condensed matter, high-energy, and quantum control. The project will therefore also establish new bridges between quantum many-body physics, machine learning, and quantum computing.",2159858,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Fundamental Limits of Sensing Systems,"This project derives information-theoretic fundamental limits and tradeoffs of classical and quantum distributed sensing (detection and estimation) systems, which are key in the Industry 4.0, smart cities, environmental applications, autonomous vehicles, etc. Our limits will: 1) serve as benchmarks for practical designs; 2) characterize the inherent tradeoffs; and 3) provide engineering guidelines.  So far, a technique is missing that can derive the limits of modern distributed sensing systems with multiple decision centers, multiple objectives, and interactive and sequential behaviours. For the emerging  field of quantum sensing even the limits of simple distributed systems have not been derived.  With our recent converse proof technique (which already served to establish limits of detection, channel coding, and compression problems) we have a powerful tool for obtaining the desired strong or probability-of-error dependent converse proofs.",2159506,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Engineering; Information and Computing Sciences; Quantum Physics
Unveiling the origins of white-dwarf explosions,"The explosive deaths of white dwarfs are essential in heavy element nucleosynthesis, galaxy feedback, and for understanding the evolution of binary systems. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are famous for their key role as cosmological-distance indicators and in the discovery of the accelerating Universe. Recent high-cadence surveys, and theoretical advances, have hinted that SNe Ia may not be the dominant way in which white dwarfs explode, with the potential existence of large populations of faint and rapidly evolving white-dwarf explosions. These unexplored classes of exotic transients may come from white dwarfs being torn apart by intermediate-mass black holes, mergers with neutron stars, or collisions in triple systems, but the mapping between explosions and observed transients is undetermined. 
This project aims at providing the first complete census of the multiple ways that white dwarfs explode by mapping their observations to their explosion physics and constraining their diversity. This sample will be crucial for defining optimal samples of SNe Ia for cosmology, as well as determining the rates and contributions of white-dwarf explosions to the origin of the elements. We will achieve this by i) obtaining the largest ever, rapidly discovered and spectroscopically confirmed sample, of white-dwarf transients with detailed follow-up observations, ii) the application of machine-learning techniques (e.g., neural-network emulators) for rapid comparison to sophisticated explosion models, and iii) the determination of the rates and diversity of their explosions in different galaxy environments. The confirmation and exploration of the multiple explosion channels for producing normal SNe Ia and exotic white-dwarf transients will have major implications for their nucleosynthetic yields, their use in cosmology, as well as predicting rates of double white dwarfs that will be detected in huge numbers in the Milky Way by the gravitational-wave detector, LISA.",2158472,2024,2029,ERC,Ireland,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Characterization of the magnetism of exoplanets,"The research in exoplanetary sciences has skyrocketed since the first discovery of planet 51 Peg b by Mayor and Queloz (1995). More than 5200 exoplanets have been discovered since and have revolutionized our understanding of how star-planet systems are formed and evolve. More and more exoplanets keep being discovered today, and their characteristics and that of their host star are being precisely determined using space-based and ground-based multi-wavelengths observations. 
Nevertheless, we are still blind to a fundamental aspect of exoplanets: what kind of magnetism and magnetosphere do they possess? On Earth, we know the magnetic field shields the atmosphere from the space environment and has been essential to maintaining life as we know it. With the advent of the SKA Observatory, we expect to detect magnetospheric radio signals from hundreds of exoplanets. These magnetospheres also lead to star-planet magnetic interactions for about a third of the known exoplanets, which leave observable traces on the activity tracers of the host star. However, such detections are not enough by themselves to quantify the magnetic properties of exoplanets due to an incomplete theoretical understanding of magnetic interactions.  
In ExoMagnets we will therefore address the following science questions: how planets interact magnetically with their environments? How much energy can be involved, and what observational tracers can be detected? What type of magnetism can be sustained by an Earth in the habitable zone of a low-mass star? We will address these questions by filling out the present theoretical gaps about the magnetic coupling between an exoplanet and its local environment. We will quantify for the first time its energetics, its observable multi-wavelength spectrum, and leverage them to constrain the magnetism of exoplanets on short-period orbit. These approaches will be combined to provide the theoretical tools to characterize the magnetism of a large sample of exoplanets.",2157235,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Shining Light on Saturated Gluons,"In this project the properties of hadronic matter with emergent non-linear saturation phenomena at extremely large parton densities are theoretically determined. This is achieved by studying  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), describing the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, at high energies.

There are solid theoretical arguments formulated in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory to suggest that saturation effects play a major role in hadronic interactions at high energies. However, so far no clear signal of gluon saturation have been observed. This will change when the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) starts to measure photon-mediated electron-nucleus collisions allowing for precision studies of high density hadronic matter in heavy nuclei.

We develop the CGC approach to high-energy QCD to the level where, for the first time, multiple scattering processes can be simultaneously described from the unified framework at next-to-leading order accuracy. These developments are necessary to bring the theoretical framework to the level required to probe non-linear dynamics in the EIC era.

We extract the non-perturbative proton structure from global analyses and determine if non-linear QCD dynamics is observable in current collider energies. We calculate predictions for the EIC and determine how different processes at the EIC probe gluon saturation. Before the EIC, photon-induced processes at high energies are available at the LHC in ultra peripheral collisions that we use to extract, for the first time, the effect of non-linear dynamics on the nuclear high-energy structure at NLO accuracy. 

The fundamentally important results are applied to develop a new description for the initial condition of heavy ion collisions where Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is produced. We determine the effect of NLO initial state description on the extraction of fundamental QGP properties, and quantify the synergies between the LHC heavy ion program and future EIC.",2153372,2024,2029,ERC,Finland,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Wave-function Networks: Probe and understand quantum many-body systems via network and complexity theory,"WaveNets aims to establish a novel theoretical paradigm for understanding quantum systems, centred on a network interpretation of many-body wave-functions.

Ongoing experimental progress motivates the need for a new theoretical approach: in the field of quantum simulation and quantum computing, probing capabilities have reached unprecedented levels, with the ability to collect thousands of wave function snapshots with impressive accuracy.
However, most of our theoretical understanding of such settings still relies on and relates to few-body observables. This has created a clear gap between experimental capabilities and theoretical tools and concepts available to understand physical phenomena. The overall goal of WaveNets is to bridge this gap by introducing a mathematical framework to describe wave-function snapshots based on network theory — wave function networks —  that will enable a completely new set of tools to address open problems in the field of quantum matter.

WaveNets' main objectives are:

- to demonstrate that wave function snapshots of correlated systems are described by scale-free networks, and classify the robustness of quantum simulators according to such;
- to formulate methods for quantifying the Kolmogorov complexity of many-body systems, and propose an information-theory-based characterization of topological matter and confinement in gauge theories;
- to propose scalable methods for measuring entanglement in quantum simulators and computers, as well as for their validation.

Achieving these objectives will (a) provide unique insights into the information structure of quantum matter, (b) enable methods of probing and controlling matter of direct experimental relevance thanks to the intrinsic scalability of network-type descriptions, and (c) establish a new, interdisciplinary bridge between quantum science, and network and data mining theory, that makes possible knowledge transfer between two mature, yet poorly connected disciplines.",2150077,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
"Early Earth, Mars and Venus as Exoplanets (EASE)","The era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a new chapter in exoplanetary research. We cannot understand exoplanets without looking back at the cradle of life as we know it - the Earth. Why did the Earth become a habitable planet? Why did Mars and Venus evolve differently? What would JWST see if it looked at the solar system planets as they were billions of years ago? My team will investigate the long-term evolution of the atmospheres and spectral fingerprints of Earth, Venus, and Mars.

I propose a unique joint evolutionary study of volcanism, atmospheric escape to space, and spectroscopy. My team will use numerical models at the cutting edge of modern development and connect their outputs to the growing list of JWST spectra of exoplanets. The team will model interior processes, the evolution of lower and upper atmospheres, and the evolving atmospheric spectra of Earth, Venus, and Mars and their possible exoplanetary analogues. Our predictions of spectral features of these three planets at different evolutionary stages will be critical for the astrophysics community to identify potential habitable worlds outside the solar system, and forecast their future evolution. My deep expertise in stellar and planetary evolution makes me uniquely well-placed to lead this project.

This project will not only significantly expand our current knowledge of the evolution of the Earth, Venus, and Mars, but will also place much better constrains on the probability for a terrestrial planet to evolve into a habitable world. The team will in particular characterize possible “failed” analogues of Earth and investigate if they could have become habitable planets under slightly different conditions. By studying for the first time this unique combination of factors that are crucial for the evolution of Earth-like worlds, my project will break new ground in the study of exoplanetary habitability.",2149668,2024,2029,ERC,Austria,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Quantum-enhanced nonlinear imaging,"Many pioneering advances in medicine and biology require observation of the microscopic world with high resolution and without damaging the specimen. One of the most widespread techniques is multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, which allows full 3D imaging via optical sectioning, i.e., imaging of planes within the sample without the need for physical slicing. This technique has a major limitation, however: the penetration depth and the signal-to-noise ratio are not sufficient for imaging deep within tissue, preventing functional imaging of, e.g., neuronal or cardiac activity beyond superficial layers.

QuNIm aims to transform the field of nonlinear imaging and microscopy by exploiting the unique properties of entanglement, a quantum mechanical superposition of two or more photons that behave like single particles. Two quantum-correlated photons are absorbed in a nonlinear process as a single particle, an event 10 billion times more probable than the absorption of two classical photons. QuNIm will apply, for the first time, the innovative concepts of spatiotemporal and multimode entanglement, super-Poissonian fluctuations, and macroscopic quantum beams to deliver a ground-breaking imaging technique. It will maintain the strengths of standard nonlinear imaging (e.g., multiphoton microscopy, boasting high resolution, 3D imaging and molecular specificity using fluorophores/photoproteins) while increasing its penetration depth and removing the drawbacks (complex ultrashort pulsed lasers, lengthy scanning procedures, and phototoxicity).

QuNIm will further extend the limit of deep-tissue imaging while at the same time enhancing the contrast and reducing the laser intensity (mitigating tissue damage), delivering a transformative impact in different fields. For example, in neuroscience, this will allow imaging of, e.g. sub-cortical brain regions fundamental for important studies into learning, memory and degenerative neural conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.",2142998,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
The Langlands Correspondence,"R. Langlands conjectured the existence of a correspondence between automorphic spectrums of Hecke algebras and representations of Galois groups of global fields. The existence of such correspondence is one of the main conjectures in mathematics. Even if not known in full generality it leads to proofs of Ferma and Sato-Tate conjectures. 

This project is on three aspects of the Langlands correspondence. The first part of this project is a description of the spectrum of Hecke algebras on the space generated by pseudo Eisenstein series of cuspidal automorphic forms of Levi subgroups. In the simplest non-trivial case, the precise description is a conjecture of Langlands. This conjecture is proven in my work with A. Okounkov, by an unexpected topological interpretation. I expect this approach to work in a number of other cases. 

The second part of this project is an extension of the Langlands correspondence to a completely new area of fields of rational functions on curves over local fields. This extension of the Langlands correspondence to a new area could lead to new interplays between Representation Theory and Number Theory.

The third part of the project is on a categorification of the Langlands correspondence necessary for establishing the strong form of this correspondence.",2139926,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Numerical and Computational Mathematics; Pure Mathematics
New isotope tracers of rocky planet forming environments,"The plethora of Earth-like exoplanets indicate that planet-formation is efficient, highlighting the need for unravelling the pathways to forming habitable worlds. The new planet-formation paradigm, i.e. pebble accretion, suggests that mm-to-cm sized pebbles are the main planetary building blocks as opposed to colliding proto-planetary bodies. Bulk samples of meteorites from asteroids, leftovers from the early Solar System, have been long used to infer the nature of Earth’s precursor material. However, pebble accretion predicts that pebble-like components of primitive chondrite meteorites provide a more accurate record of the precursor material to terrestrial planets, including the source of volatiles critical to life. The most abundant chondrite constituents are mm-sized chondrules hypothesized to be the pebbles driving planet formation. Chondrules formed within 5 Myr of the Solar System thus represent time-sequenced samples that can probe the nature of the matter, including its environment(s), that accreted to rocky planets. We will elucidate the origin and history of the matter precursor to terrestrial planets, by studying chondrules, matrix and refractory components in chondrites. This information is key for understanding the initial conditions allowing the formation of Earth-like planets. Combining isotope fingerprinting, age-dating and petrology, our data will be obtained using state-of-the-art techniques, including next generation collision cell and thermal ionization mass spectrometry as well as high-resolution imaging. We will identify the precursor matter to terrestrial planets and probe how its composition varied in space and time, identify the disk environment where the primordial population of planetesimals seeds formed and evaluate the role of thermal processing and outward recycling in modifying inner disk matter. With these goals, including high-risk high-gain ventures, we are in a strong position to make step change discoveries in cosmochemistry.",2133443,2024,2029,ERC,Denmark,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
FRIED: External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs,"Our understanding of planet formation is heavily influenced by observations of protoplanetary discs within 150pc of the Sun. Their proximity makes them easiest to detect and resolve, however, these discs are actually atypical. They are in sparse stellar clusters without massive stars, and so the radiation environment is weak. Most stars form in massive clusters, with OB stars that emit copious UV radiation. This drives ""external photoevaporation"" (EP) winds from discs, resulting in a rapid reduction of their mass, radius and lifetime. The radiation environment could hence control the resulting exoplanets in stellar clusters and this is being missed in our focus on nearby discs. However, understanding the role of UV environment requires a huge chain of physics and astrophysics, from giant molecular clouds and star formation, down to the radiation hydrodynamic chemical models of dispersing discs. We cannot understand typical planet formation without the necessary theoretical framework for EP, verified by observations. 

This proposal will establish that theoretical framework. We will develop new state of the art 3D radiation hydrodynamic and photodissociation region chemistry calculations to determine the structure and mass loss rate of EP winds in a range of UV environments. Understanding EP in isolation is just part of the story, with internal winds driven by the host star. We will develop the first models of the interplay between internal and external winds to understand the combined mass loss and observational implications. The connection to star formation is also vital. Stars form over time in clusters and begin their lives embedded, which can shield discs from EP. We will determine how giant molecular clouds collapse and stellar feedback in the cloud sets the role of EP. Our theoretical models will provide predictions to drive observational programs. This work is necessary for understanding the most common disc evolution and hence planet formation scenarios.",2120155,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Cavity quantum materials,"Light-matter coupling has the potential to modify functional properties of quantum materials to yield the tunability required for quantum-technological applications. However, light-matter control concepts, such as Floquet engineering and light-induced phase transitions, suffer from the requirement of strong laser driving and the lack of coherence on long time scales. Overcoming these key limitations through advancing the infant field of cavity quantum materials is the central objective of CAVMAT.

The main hypothesis behind CAVMAT is that cavity materials engineering combines the efficiency of strong-light matter coupling in cavities with the flexibility of Floquet engineering of macroscopic quantum many-body phenomena. CAVMAT aims to explore and expand this new frontier with a combined theoretical-computational effort. The three key objectives of CAVMAT are: (i) To establish cavity-driving schemes that successfully bridge the gap between quantum cavity and semiclassical many-photon Floquet limits. (ii) To propose realistic cavity quantum materials platforms providing guidance for next-generation experiments. (iii) To develop and combine numerical methods that can treat the relevant nonequilibrium electron-polariton problems at short and long time scales. These objectives will be tackled in three work packages, namely WP 1: quantum Floquet engineering, WP 2: plasmonic superconductivity, and WP 3: excited states by design.

The proposed work goes well beyond state-of-the-art in both nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems and quantum optics, and its success will be groundbreaking through providing microscopic underpinnings for pathways towards versatile solid-state platforms for cavity and Floquet physics.",2111991,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Quantum Ergodicity: Stability and Transitions,"We shall develop methods and models for analyzing quantum ergodicity in many-body systems, proving its stability against small perturbations, and studying ergodicity-breaking transitions due to integrability, disorder, or localized impurities. Ergodicity is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics and a key manifestation of many-body quantum chaos, while manipulating ergodicity and engineering ergodicity-breaking transitions will have immense applications (cf.scarred states in Rydberg arrays, heating transitions in Floquet systems, time crystalline phases of matter). PI proposed groundbreaking methods for establishing quantum ergodicity by rigorous analysis of spectral statistics, correlation functions, dynamical complexity indicators and entanglement on the basis of space-time duality. Most of current understanding of many-body physics or quantum fields is based on perturbative expansions around free, integrable or localized models. Here we propose a twist of paradigm: We shall study weak perturbations of statistically exactly solvable ergodic models, such as dual-unitary chaotic quantum circuits proposed by PI. An intuitive expectation of structural stability of ergodic dynamics (in analogy to rigorous results in classical ergodic theory) implies that such expansions typically have, unlike expansions around free/integrable models, finite radii of convergence. Various order parameters of the ergodic phase shall be developed and compared in their utility to signal and characterize ergodicity-breaking transitions. A related goal is a construction of exactly solvable models in which the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis can be proven. Being of fundamental importance in mathematical and statistical physics, the results are expected to have widespread applications across fields: from studying localization transitions in disordered systems, benchmarking quantum simulators and certifying quantum supremacy, to rigorous proofs of chaos in holographic models of black holes.",2105018,2024,2029,ERC,Slovenia,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Quantum Physics
Amenable C*-dynamics and their classification,"Our understanding of amenable C*-algebras has drastically improved over the past decade due to substantial advances in the Elliott classification program. The proposed research is intended to spearhead the classification and structure theory for C*-dynamics, which encompasses groups acting continuously on C*-algebras and the question to which extent their detailed structure is encoded at the level of computable invariants. The objectives involve the following lines of investigation:
- The case of discrete groups acting on simple amenable C*-algebras, the latter of which have become accessible due to recent methodological breakthroughs within Elliott's program. The task is to develop a dynamical version of Elliott's program, i.e., to consider natural categories of such group actions, identify functorial invariants such as K-theory and traces, and show that these invariants completely classify a naturally occuring category up to a suitable notion of isomorphism.
- The theory of invariants for noncommutative C*-dynamics. This field is faced with numerous open problems requiring solutions before a fully general classification theory can be developed. This part of the project addresses the need for effective computational methods for equivariant Kasparov classes, or systematic techniques to exploit equivariant Ext-theory for the purpose of classification.
- The case of noncommutative time evolutions, which includes new rigidity phenomena for the passage of time in simple C*-algebras, both with and without the presence of equilibrium states.
A deeply rooted theme within all these objectives is the presence of amenability for the actions and the C*-algebras, which gives rise to radically new phenomena in the context of non-amenable acting groups. Drawing ideas from diverse areas such as the Elliott program, equivariant Kasparov theory, classical and noncommutative ergodic theory, novel methods are proposed to achieve groundbreaking results in the area of C*-dynamics.",2100950,2024,2029,ERC,Belgium,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Atomic scale coherent manipulation of the electron spin in semiconductors,"Currently, a great deal of experimental research is dedicated to implement qubits on a wide variety of physical systems. In the last decade researchers have observed optically-active point-defects in 2D materials which serve as single photon sources and present spin-dependent optical emission, making them promising spin-photon interfaces. In parallel, new local probe techniques have been developed to detect magnetic resonance on single atomic spins, and more recently to demonstrate controlled charging and positioning of point-centres in 2D semiconductors. OneSPIN lies at the junction of these very active fields. Inspired by the opportunity that these recent findings bring, I propose to coherently probe single electronic spins localized at point-centres in 2D semiconductors and to engineer their atomic environment. The ultimate goal of this proposal is the demonstration of long spin coherence times for quantum information applications. 

To achieve this ambitious goal, I will develop a novel approach based on a unique scanning tunnelling microscopy technique which allows for the engineering, excitation and optical detection of single spin resonance. This approach provides a solution to the current lack of tools capable of simultaneously recording the atomic and electronic structure of defects, their optoelectronic response, and the coherence properties of their spins. Using this tool, it will be possible to not only determine the role of the environment on spin coherence, but also to engineer it by deterministically moving localization centres over the surface, creating tailored ensembles of localized spin states. I will use 2D semiconductors which, being chemically stable and “all surface”, are systems which can naturally be addressed, manipulated and engineered using local probe techniques. OneSPIN has the potential to open new opportunities in the fields of material science, quantum information and semiconductor-based quantum technologies.",2070911,2024,2028,ERC,France,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Challenging AI with Challenges from Physics: How to solve fundamental problems in Physics by AI and vice versa,"AI is a disruptive technology that is currently changing not only many research fields but also substantially challenges current business concepts. Keeping up with the ever-faster progress on one hand side and the ever increasing competition from US and Chinese IT giants is a challenge for European Industry and Research Institutions. Yet, new concepts are required to keep pace. This concept is to intertwine modern AI concepts with strategies from the application field, a strategy where we claim that we can contribute substantially to a novel and promising research field. 

Particle physics is a formidable basis for such developments as there are no critical, personal data, data can be easily generated; and we have a good understanding of the underlying models and the ground truth. Yet, particle physics has challenges such as detailed questions of new physics and extremely high precision of the results. We identified three main fields where this project will contribute by solving 1) highly ill-posed inverse problems using physics models, 2) handling uncertainties, rare events and give reliable error bounds, and finally, 3) to be able to give explanations of the machine learning results in terms of physics ontologies and models. 

This highly challenging research agenda is tackled by 9 internationally recognized and leading researchers from both physics and computer science, from 5 universities in 5 European countries, all being member of the 4EU+ Alliance of European Universities. Over 4EU+ an excellent infrastructure for unique training opportunities is available to enable the research fellows to reach the ambitious goals, on one hand side and to educate them in critical and innovative thinking, management and social skills to prepare them optimally for leading positions in academics and industry.",2064433,2024,2028,European Commission,Germany; Switzerland; Denmark; Italy; France; France,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
SPUD: Single-Photon Unimolecular Devices,"Single-photon emitters play a key role in quantum information processing, with the prospect of faster and more secure communication, computing with increased efficiency and metrology/sensing with unprecedented sensitivity. Of the possible existing technologies, electrically-driven sources based on ""single-quantum"" emitters - isolated two-level systems - offer significant advantages in terms of future scalability, low operational costs, ease of integration in existing classical devices and possible monolithic fabrication. There is, however, still no ""ideal"" on-demand (deterministic) single-photon emitter, and every proposed technology suffers from efficiency drawbacks or provides challenges in scaling beyond the laboratory proof-of-concept. 

The race for the ideal single-photon source is on. 

In SPUD, I propose to use single molecules, electrically wired and chemically soldered to two nanoelectrodes (""single-molecule junctions""), as single-photon sources. The two-level nature of isolated single-molecules results in a theoretically ideal behaviour for non-classical light emission, and they can also offer reduced size, a vast explorable chemical space of myriad of structures, ease of integration in hybrid devices and they rely on inexpensive and non-toxic materials - carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc. All these properties have been known since the early 1990s, but only recent development allow their stable and reproducible integration in electronic circuits, thus offering the enticing possibility of using them to convert electrical current into light, one photon at a time. In this project, we will demonstrate that single-molecule junctions can be efficient, on-demand single-photon sources, and that the experimental freedom granted by their structure offers a unique platform for the exploitation of their properties, merging the fields of molecular electronics and molecular photonics to deliver a uniquely tailorable class of devices for future quantum technologies.",2031525,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Dual-type Dual-element Atom Array for Quantum Computation and Simulation,"Quantum science promises great potential to revolutionize our current technologies. This project aims for building a novel architecture based on dual-type dual-element atom arrays in a bilayer structure to realize scalable quantum computation and simulation. The past few years have witnessed rapid progress on using arrays of individually trapped atoms as a programmable quantum processor, which has demonstrated its great scalability (>300 qubits) and programmability over array geometry. Recent achievements include simulating quantum spin models, implementing high-fidelity quantum gate operations, and proof of principle demonstration of solving classically hard optimization problems. However, several challenges remain, including reconfigurable individual addressability for qubit/spin operation and non-demolition selective detection, which lead to limited efficiency in implementing quantum algorithms, low experimental repetition rates, and preclude applications of many measurement-based protocols and quantum error correction. Here, I propose a novel architecture that overcomes these challenges and enables experimental study on the frontier topics in quantum information dynamics, with the long-term goal aiming for realizing fault-tolerant general-purpose quantum computation. This architecture combines an array of individually trapped ytterbium (Yb) atoms and an array of rubidium (Rb) atomic ensembles in a bilayer structure, with each layer having its own unique functionality and in which the interlayer interaction can be rapidly tuned with external electric field via Förster resonance. Arrays of individual atoms store quantum information, which is encoded with the electronic states of Yb atoms, while arrays of Rb atomic ensembles are used to perform ancillary operations on Yb atoms, including rapidly reconfigurable local qubit operation, and fast, non-demolition detection. With these newly invented schemes, this platform can implement previously inaccessible protocols including efficient generation of target quantum states, and is compatible with quantum error correction. On the fundamental physics side, the proposed platform is suitable for investigating frontier topics in the field of quantum information dynamics, opening up the possibility of interspersing quantum unitary dynamics with quantum measurement. Despite the huge interest from the theoretical prospect, experimental study on this topic with neutral atom-based platforms is still lacking. The proposed architecture opens new routes to experimentally investigate the phenomena predicted by theory and provide insight into open questions. In my vision, having different types of atom arrays with their own unique functionality is a promising conception for realizing scalable quantum computation/simulation, which will certainly lead to scientific discoveries and have a huge impact on revolutionizing many industries. If the proposed project is successful, I envision this architecture to be emerged as an attractive approach, which will be followed by other groups. Beyond the funding period, this experimental platform can continue being used for implementing practical quantum technologies including quantum error correction.

QuSeC-TAQS: Nanodiamond Quantum Sensing for Four-Dimensional Live-Cell Imaging,"This project aims to revolutionize live-cell imaging by harnessing the power of nanodiamond quantum sensing and advanced microscopy. By developing nanodiamond quantum sensors with exceptional sensitivity, this project will study intricacies of life processes with unprecedented detail. This research aligns with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and serves the national interest by advancing the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms. While traditional fluorescence microscopy provides valuable insights into cell structures and functions, nanodiamond quantum sensors with ultra-high sensitivity to local electromagnetic fields offer a new dimension to see through live cells and reveal the underlying physical mechanisms of life processes. By integrating nanodiamond quantum sensors with advanced imaging techniques, this project will capture four-dimensional (4D) information, encompassing three-dimensional spatial data and an additional temporal dimension. This has wide-ranging implications, from enhancing cancer immunotherapy through the monitoring of T cell activity to unraveling the mysteries of membrane potentials in cardiac and neuronal cells. Furthermore, this project extends beyond scientific discoveries. It encompasses comprehensive educational and outreach programs, with a particular focus on fostering diversity in STEM fields. By engaging underrepresented minorities in quantum-related studies, this team aims to create a vibrant and inclusive community of quantum scientists and engineers. This project not only supports education but also benefits society at large, offering new avenues for biomedical research and applications. The research will involve the fabrication of scalable nanodiamond sensors with biocompatible interfaces, uniform sizes and shapes, controlled color center densities, and minimal impurities. By integrating optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nanodiamond quantum sensors with light-sheet microscopy (LSM), this team will achieve high spatiotemporal resolution and low phototoxicity, enabling precise imaging of live cells. The technical approach includes the utilization of machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques to analyze the acquired data and extract valuable insights into the dynamics of live cells. Particularly, this team will apply the developed ODMR-LSM quantum sensing imaging technology to study T cell activity in cancer immunotherapy and measure membrane electrical potential. The synergy between nanodiamond quantum sensing and advanced imaging techniques will deepen the understanding of complex biological processes. The proposed nanodiamond quantum sensing system, with the ability for correlating the ODMR spectroscopy and the spatiotemporal imaging of LSM, allows for revealing 4D live-cell dynamics which have not been studied before. This project will bridge the gap between fundamental quantum science and applied bioengineering and bring quantum sensing into rich applications in biomedical fields.

Exotic isotope production for medical applications,"Radioactive isotopes have ratio of protons and neutrons that results in their instability. This presents both a plethora of opportunities, and a challenge to obtain them due to their finite nature. This work seeks to meet the rising medical demand for these exotic isotopes, through the development of new technologies and approaches for radioactive isotope production and separation. While the use of established medical isotopes is growing, there are challenges to the supply as nuclear research reactors are decommissioned across the world. Additionally, the application of non-standard isotopes such as 225Ac have shown significant promise for the treatment of cancers, while others have applications in medical imaging. Reliable processes for the production and separation of these isotopes are required to realise the full potential of these applications and to produce pre-clinical amounts for initial studies. This work seeks to address this through ion source and electromagnetic mass separator development for exotic medical isotope production.",1997313,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Constraining black hole origins with cosmological simulations,"My research program aims at constraining the origins of massive black holes (MBHs). These compact and massive objects are ubiquitous in the Universe and their role in shaping their host galaxies through their energetic feedback is fascinating. MBHs inhabit galaxy centers and weigh from thousands of our Sun’s mass in dwarf galaxies to billions in the largest ellipticals. The discovery of bright quasars powered by extremely massive MBHs only 700 million years after theBig Bang implies that MBHs must originate from black hole seeds formed in the early Universeand that have grown in mass efficiently over time. Yet, we do not know how and when these seeds appeared in the first galaxies, what their initial properties were, and what made some of these seeds blossom to become galaxies’ central MBHs. The existence of empirical relations between the mass of MBHs and the properties of their host galaxies demonstrate their co-evolution across cosmic times and that we cannot understand galaxy formation without understanding first the origins of MBHs.To make headway in MBH origins, my group will build a unique and innovative theoretical andcomputational framework to connect MBH formation theory to current and future MBH observa-tions. We will develop state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulationsincluding, for the first time, today’s leading theoretical models for MBH formation. These simula-tions of tens of Mpc scale model dark and baryonic matters in an expanding space-time, and willcapture the time evolution of thousands of galaxies and their MBHs. With those, we will assessand constrain statistically how often the conditions for MBH formation are met in the Universe,in how many galaxies MBHs form, and what their properties are.Comparing our predictions to current and future observations will put my group in a uniqueposition to determine the relative contributions of MBH formation models in the Universe. Wewill compare our predictions to observations of MBHs in present-day low-mass galaxies and ob-servations in the high-redshift Universe. My program is very timely as novel and upcomingelectromagnetic and gravitational wave missions (e.g., JWST, Euclid, Roman, Athena, LISA)will soon detect MBHs unprecedentedly close to the redshift of their formation. Our theoreticaleffort will establish a key roadmap of multi-band multi-messenger diagnostics of MBH origins forthese missions that will revolutionize the field.With the SNSF Grant, I propose to establish a strong theoretical pole of MBH origins at theUniversity of Genève. The new framework that my group will build will play a pivotal role inthe field to prepare next-generation missions, interpret upcoming and future observations, andunravel MBHs’ avenues of formation.",1996321,2024,2029,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
Cosmological phase transitions of Standard Model Matter and their gravitational wave signatures,"The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory of the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions, describing the elementary particles of nature at microscopic length scales. The precise theoretical predictions of the Standard Model are put to the test in contemporary and future high-energy particle collider experiments. Besides explaining matter around us in the present, the Standard Model also predicts the distant past of our Universe, by describing the behavior of particles at temperatures as high as it used to be just fractions of seconds after the Big Bang. The relics of the cosmological phase transitions in this era of our Universe are actively sought
for via their gravitational wave signatures in current and future observatories. 
Most of the relevant features of hot Standard Model matter are non-perturbative, implying that a first-principles treatment is only possible via computer simulations of the underlying field theories on space-time lattices. This proposal will use such large-scale lattice field theory simulations to determine the properties of cosmological phase transitions and thus significantly improve our understanding of how the early Universe cooled down and became the world that we know today.
Specifically, we will perform the first full physical simulations of hot, electrically charged strongly interacting matter. We will also substantially improve on existing calculations of the weak and electromagnetic interactions at high temperature. The computational effort of the combined treatment of these forces is immense – we will overcome these challenges by employing optimized algorithms and cutting-edge technologies including machine learning methods. For both systems, we will determine the nature of the high-temperature transition and analyze the induced gravitational wave spectrum. Our results will provide the most accurate description of Standard Model matter in the early Universe.",1991516,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Orbital Chern Insulators in van der Waals Moiré Systems,"Topological electronic phases manifest fascinating phenomena, including electronic transport via topologically-protected edge states, anomalous responses to external fields, and excitations with anyonic statistics. Harnessing these phenomena in electronic devices will lead to a technological breakthrough. The main obstacle to this has been the lack of topological systems that are simultaneously clean, versatile, robust, and highly tunable. We argue that the recent discovery of orbital Chern insulators (OCI) in graphene moiré heterostructures opens an exceptional opportunity to make a leap in our ability to manipulate topological electronic phases.

Recently, moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials emerged as a powerful tool to realize correlated electronic phases. The exciting discovery of intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall effects in graphene moiré systems revealed interaction-driven orbital Chern insulating states at zero magnetic field.  Unlike in most known magnets, the magnetism in OCIs arises predominantly from the orbital motion of the electrons rather than their spins, endowing them with unique properties. Remarkably, the moiré heterostructures hosting OCIs could also be gate-tuned to superconducting, correlated insulating, and metallic isospin-ferromagnetic states, which opens unprecedented opportunities for novel devices. These unique features of OCIs set them apart and warrant their thorough investigation.

This proposal aims to establish the fundamental properties of OCIs, focusing on three key questions: (i) What are the phase diagram, isospin order, and thermodynamics of OCIs? (ii) What is the physics of the chiral edge states and domain walls in OCIs? (iii) Can strong interactions in flat moiré bands lead to fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect? To address these questions, we will apply a combination of complementary experimental techniques to probe electronic transport and thermodynamic properties in high-quality graphene moiré devices.",1982576,2024,2029,ERC,Austria,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
NGSNCOSMO - Next Generation Supernova Cosmology,"Cosmology is at the threshold of a new era. The standard, Lambda-CDM, model, till recently, has been an excellent explanation of observations in the early and late universe. The recent tension between the local Hubble constant (H0) and the inference from early universe, is a strong challenge to Lambda-CDM, with profound consequences for particle physics and cosmology. While this tension can be a sign of novel physics, e.g., a contribution from massive neutrinos or a modified theory of gravity, it can also be a realization of unknown systematic effects. It is, therefore, urgent to explore such measurements from more than one method. This project will tackle the open question ""is there new physics beyond Lambda-CDM?"" with cutting edge transient surveys in three steps: 1) Developing strongly lensed supernovae as an exciting new probe of H0, independent of either the early universe or the local distance scale. 2) sidestepping known systematics in local H0, by constructing a unique distance ladder from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by a single survey, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) 3) pioneering an empirical test of the directional dependence of H0 using the SN Ia magnitude-redshift relation. The Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO), online imminently, is expected to discover hundreds of lensed SNe. Utilizing state-of-the-art spectrographs, e.g., NOT and 4MOST, we will build a sample of lensed SNe from the VRO and measure H0 with 1.3% accuracy. Implementing modern methods for distances to the ZTF SN Ia host galaxies from tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) stars, we will overcome the current largest distance scale error sources, i.e. host galaxy bias and calibration. Forthcoming spectroscopy surveys will allow precise inference of ZTF SN Ia host galaxy redshifts, shedding light on potential anisotropies in the Hubble constant. These interconnected channels for measuring the Hubble constant and its directional dependence will enable a precise and accurate test of Lambda-CDM.",1977617,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Particle and High Energy Physics
AEON+: Enabling time-domain and multi-messenger follow-up at all wavelengths,"The U.S. has been at the forefront of new technologies that have given us new ways to study objects in space that change with time. Software can alert us to new discoveries, but the discovery data alone aren't enough for us to fully understand what's going on. Additional observations are required, often from several different telescopes. These follow-up observations are often needed at short notice, to help us to understand objects that are changing quickly. This project will enable astronomers to contact telescopes and ask for the observations they need using software. This will make it possible to coordinate follow-up observations across optical, infrared and radio telescopes. Astronomers will also be able to observe X-ray and UV signals using the Swift Space Telescope. The project will also foster collaborations between observatories and astronomers. The investigators will organize a program of workshops and collaborative visits. By sharing experience and tools, they will reduce duplication of effort, and make tools developed by different teams work together. To characterize discoveries from gravitational wave, neutrino and electromagnetic Time Domain and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (TD/MMA) surveys, it is essential to coordinate timely follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum from many different ground-and space-based telescopes. The Astronomical Event Observatories Network (AEON) has demonstrated how quite different telescope facilities can collaborate to enable observation requests to be submitted through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with flexible modes of scheduling. This enables the science community to directly request observations through software, streamlining observing programs, which can then be automated. This has proven to enable highly efficient and flexible observations that are critical to performing timely follow-up of TD/MMA targets. Historically, most observatories have developed their operating software independently, leading to a range of platforms customized for each facility. Instead, this project will create a open-source software library that can submit observations to a wide range of AEON-compatible facilities. As a stand-alone library, this code can then be used within any community-developed platform or software. In addition to facilities that are already in AEON (Las Cumbres, SOAR, Gemini), this project, led by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, will extend the new library to enable observations at the Keck Observatories, the Skynet telescope network and facilities operated by the National Radio Astronomical Observatory. The project will host regular Observatories Forum workshops, bringing together observatory staff and science community developers to share experience and tools, and fostering interoperability between platforms. It will also enable staff from different observatories to collaborate directly by creating a Visiting Developers program. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1969052,2025,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Space Sciences
Emergent Symmetries in Critical Statistical Physics Systems,"Statistical physics is meant to derive the macroscopic behaviour of large complex physical systems from the interactions between their microscopic constituents. The concept of phase transition -- i.e. a sudden change in a system as certain parameters vary continuously -- has been the focus of revolutionary developments in theoretical physics including  Wilson's renormalisation group method in the seventies and conformal field theory in the eighties. While statistical physics was born and still is a major area of research in physics, it also became later on an active and major area of mathematics and mathematical physics.In the last twenty years, our mathematical understanding of phase transitions progressed tremendously, in part due to the work of the PI, yet the profound physical concepts of universality and emergent symmetries remain a formidable open problem for mathematicians.Capitalising on my recent successes, I wish to conduct groundbreaking research by improving our mathematical understanding of universality and emergent symmetries in the case of lattice models such as the Ising model, self-avoiding walks, various percolation models, and random height functions. To achieve this,  I plan to pursue the development of my group in Geneva by hiring PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. The research will be axed on the following three main objectives:----Objective A. Prove conformal invariance of a vast family of 2D dependent percolation models at criticality. This will imply the conformal invariance of many other lattice models  and therefore reconcile their analysis with conformal field theory. Objective B. Derive the limit of critical lattice models above their so-called upper-critical dimension by developing a new technique whose range of applicability exceeds the known perturbative techniques, and relate these critical models to constructive quantum field theory.Objective C. Break new grounds in our understanding of intermediate dimensions (for instance 3D) for a variety of models including the Ising model and Bernoulli percolation by using the conformal bootstrap as well as new probabilistic techniques.----In recent years, the PI developed a number of techniques that changed the way certain of these problems can be attacked and that represented a breakthrough towards their resolution. Among other things, the PI proposes to tackle these challenges using (and further developing) techniques such as integrable systems, coupling methods, probabilistic renormalisation arguments, graphical representations, discrete holomorphicity, imaginary geometry, to cite just a few. The topics in this proposal involve various fields of mathematics, including probability, integrable systems, complex analysis, and combinatorics. The problems range from tractable questions aimed at initiating the new members of the collaboration to the subject, to long-standing and very ambitious conjectures on which even partial progress would already represent a major breakthrough in mathematical physics.",1968485,2024,2029,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Classical Physics
Interacting topological quantum chemistry,"Over the past decade our understanding of the band theory of solids has been revolutionized through descriptions in terms of homotopic topology and more recently topological quantum chemistry. Together with advances in density functional theory, this enabled theoretical analyses with high predictive power for weakly interacting electron systems, tightly connecting experimental and theoretical progress and largely accelerating topological materials discovery. Important milestones were the discovery of two- and three-dimensional topological insulators, Weyl and Dirac semimetals and higher order topological insulators.In contrast, research on intrinsically interacting topological phases of electronic matter is at a completely different stage. On a mathematically abstract level, their topological classification and the systematic construction of contrived models have been achieved. More physically motivated studies focused on specific models and regimes, potentially hosting, e.g., spin liquid phases. However, a systematic connection between these two strides of research is missing. Reasons are the high computational complexity for evaluating interacting topological invariants and a lack of intuitive interacting physical model states, analogous to the atomic limits of trivial band insulators. With this SNSF Consolidator Grant, I propose to develop a theoretical framework, called interacting topological quantum chemistry (iTQC), to address this outstanding problem. Concretely, I plan toi) formulate iTQC as a practical topological classification of interacting electronic phases, which makes extensive use of crystalline symmetries and is based on many-body Green's functions;ii) develop and provide routines to extract the topological information from different types of numerical simulations including tensor network calculations, quantum Monte Carlo computations, cluster perturbation theory, as well as variational quantum eigensolvers to be run on quantum hardware; iii) characterize phases of previously-studied models within iTQC and propose new physically motivated models for phases not yet captured;iv) identify promising candidates for interacting topological states among the existing and emerging material platforms;v) work with experimental collaborators to realize and identify these phases.Recent experimental breakthroughs, such as the realization of correlated states in heterostructures of van der Waals materials, provide a focus area for experimental tests of iTQC. We expect that the results of this project provide a boost to the study of interacting topological states, in particular with respect to real materials and experimental probes.",1965852,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Quantum Complexity from Quantum Field Theories to Quantum Gravity.,"Quantum field theories (QFTs) are our best models to describe nature, from new phases of matter to black holes. Still, to simulate them efficiently, we need to know the best ways to create interesting quantum states from the basic building blocks used in computation. This problem necessitates a precise definition of “quantum complexity”, to quantify what is hard and what is easy in QFTs, and its provision is one of the most urgent problems at the interplay between theoretical physics, quantum information and computation.
This project aims to develop precise measures of the complexity of states and operators in QFTs and apply them, in the holographic correspondence, as new probes of black hole interiors. 
Recent attempts to quantify complexity, pioneered by PI and his group, have explored geometric, path integral and Krylov methods, preparing the ground for a universal approach to complexity in quantum systems. Building on this, the project objectives are to: 
- synthesise and develop complexity measures for QFTs,
- formulate them in exact holographic models,
- apply them to shed new light on the physics behind black-hole horizons and spacetime singularities.
Developing complexity measures in open quantum systems, models with additional symmetries and quantum scars, and quantifying the complexity of modular evolution are among the key milestones to achieve the objectives. Our methods will involve analytical and numerical computations in free and interacting QFTs, including integrability, conformal symmetry, Krylov basis, Arnoldi algorithm, and finally, the AdS/CFT correspondence and quantum gravity. This interdisciplinary and timely project will push the boundaries of our understanding of QFTs and black holes. The new tools that we will develop will allow us to chart the complexity frontier of quantum many-body systems, help to understand thermalisation, and shed light on the behaviour of matter near cosmological singularities relevant to our early universe.",1964226,2024,2029,ERC,Sweden,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Coherent Control of Chiral Molecules,"The ambitious goal of this project is to create an enantiomer-pure beam of chiral molecules, starting from a racemic sample, using an experimental coherent state preparation scheme.
The basic elements of the proposed experiments are the following.
A cold, gas-phase beam of chiral molecules is created via supersonic jet expansion. Two levels of a triad of rotational states that are connected via electric dipole allowed transitions are emptied using resonant UV depletion in combination with simultaneous microwave repumping.
Driving a closed triad of rotational transitions using microwaves prepares a chosen internal quantum state of the chiral molecules enantiomer-specifically. This is called enantiomer-specific state transfer; a new method, that I co-developed. After coherence preparation using collimation, state-selective matter-wave diffraction is accomplished using a resonant, absorptive optical grating.
The diffracted enantiomer-pure beam is detected state-selectively using 2D planar laser-induced fluorescence detection.
Eventually, this beam can be used for further spectroscopic or scattering studies or for depositing the enantiopure sample on a surface.
The scheme that is to be demonstrated in COCOCIMO will be applicable to any chiral molecule.",1959004,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Delineating the boundary between the computational power of quantum and classical devices,"This project sets out to assess, make use of and verify the computational power of realistic quantum devices. It comprehensively identifies quantum simulators and paradigmatic quantum devices that are computationally superior to classical supercomputers, based on presently available or plausible physical architectures. In doing so, it explores the fine line that discriminates regimes featuring a quantum advantage from ones that are accessible to efficient classical simulation. This naturally two-pronged approach is on the one hand concerned with (1) novel classical simulation tools for seemingly deeply quantum prescriptions and with identifying limitations of variational approaches and quantum simulation schemes. On the other hand, (2) it identifies new practically minded applications of quantum devices that exhibit a computational speed-up over classical machines, with potentially game-changing applications emerging  for learning tasks. To achieve this goal, it digs deeply into computer science that provides sophisticated tools of computational complexity and of machine learning, and is instrumental in devising methods for the classical simulation of intricate quantum problems. At the same time, it draws on the physics of complex systems. This proposal suggests an interdisciplinary effort by bringing together ideas of quantum information, condensed matter physics, complexity theory, machine learning, tensor network theory, and methods that are unusual  in this context  such as signal processing. Individually, each objective substantially advances the respective field, but it is their combination that will permit a true breakthrough by delineating the delicate boundary between quantum and classical computations of synthetic quantum devices.",1956827,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Searching for physics beyond the standard model in low-energy precision observables,"Low-energy precision observables provide key insights into possible effects beyond the Standard Model (BSM) of particle physics, complementary to searches at the energy frontier. In fact, many of our current hints for BSM contributions originate from tensions observed when confronting precise low-energy measurements with the expectations in the SM. In many cases, the precision with which possible BSM effects can be constrained, and thus the reach of the experiment, crucially depend on predictions within the SM. In this proposal, three experimental areas are identified in which significant investments will be made in the next decade and whose interpretation benefits most from improvedtheory: a potential measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau at Belle II, improved measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at Fermilab and J-PARC, and BSM searches using atomic nuclei including DARWIN and COMET/Mu2e. In each case, the aim of the project is to improve the SM prediction and thus allow one to increase the return on the experimental investments, either by improved exclusion limits or higher significance of detection. The calculations will be performed using the appropriate (effective) field theories and dispersion relations, specifically tailored towards the high-precision requirements in each application.",1954390,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Boulder School for Condensed Matter and Materials Physics,"The Boulder School for Condensed Matter and Materials Physics provides education for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working in condensed matter physics, materials science and related fields. The goal is to enable students to work at the frontiers of science and technology by providing expert training not easily available within the traditional system of graduate education and postdoctoral apprenticeship. Boulder School strongly emphasizes pedagogy, breadth and depth of material covered. It contributes an educational experience to new generations of talented scientists interested in condensed matter and material science through four weeks of structured lectures, tutorials, discussions, poster sessions and student-run seminars. The Boulder School plays an important role in the condensed matter and materials physics community. It provides outreach to the public in the Boulder and greater Denver area, exposing its citizens to modern materials science. Through a diverse and evolving set of lectures, posted on the School’s website, and webcast on YouTube and video-recorded, it contributes to the community well beyond student participants attending the School. Student feedback indicates that in addition to providing a great deal of learning material, the School provides an invaluable scientific network that lasts well into students’ professional careers. Schools may also provide opportunities to expose local teachers and high school students to modern materials science.

Doping Compensation in Thin Silicon Sensors: the pathway to Extreme Radiation Environments,"Silicon sensors have been extensively exploited in high-energy physics experiments in the past 40 years, from their first use in NA11 at the SPS (CERN) to their application in the present-day design of very large particle trackers. The capability of silicon sensors to work in environments with high radiation levels has been of utmost importance for experiments at accelerating machines with very energetic and intense particle beams. Presently available silicon sensors can operate efficiently up to particle fluences of 2E16/cm2, while future frontier accelerators envisage the use of silicon sensors in environments with fluences exceeding 5E17/cm2. If not overcome, this gap will prevent the use of silicon sensors in future hadron-collider experiments.

CompleX aims at extending the range of operation of silicon detectors by more than one order of magnitude, up to a fluence of 5E17/cm2. The idea behind this unprecedented target in radiation tolerance relies on a novel understanding of the saturation of the radiation damage and on the advantages that compensated implants bring to radiation hardness. The application of these two breakthroughs to thin silicon sensors (20–40 microns) with an internal gain of 10–20 will allow the design of sensors able to operate up to the target fluence.

I am the PI of three projects to develop silicon sensors for extreme fluences (eXFlu – INFN, eXFlu-innova – AIDAinnova, FLEX – UNITO), which represent preparatory developments for the CompleX proposal. In this context, I introduced the principle of doping compensation in silicon sensors to the detector community. My expertise in the design and testing of silicon sensors, my involvement in radiation hardness studies, and my experience in project coordination qualify me as a recognised expert in the development of sensors for extreme fluences and enable me, as PI, to target the CompleX goals.",1949472,2024,2029,ERC,Italy; Italy; Italy,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Nuclear and Plasma Physics"
Overcoming the sign problem in lattice gauge theories using tensor networks,"Tensor networks, and particularly projected entangled pair states (PEPS), are special quantum many-body states that describe strongly-correlated systems well due to their entanglement structure. They have been successfully applied in various scenarios and recently to lattice gauge theories (LGTs) where they outperformed conventional Monte-Carlo calculations and overcame the sign problem in some examples, but mostly in single-space dimensions due to limitations of tensor network methods. A fundamental analogy between PEPS and gauge theories suggests that PEPS are suitable for studying LGTs and that gauge symmetry, often seen as complicating the numerics, can help in overcoming the sign problem and perform efficient tensor network computations in higher dimensions. The overarching goal of this project is to use this analogy in analytical and numerical ways, aiming to (1) analytically devise a comprehensive new formalism for LGT PEPS and the physics they describe by allowing one to construct the optimal PEPS to be used as variational ansatz states when combined with numerical techniques; (2) devise numerical methods for studying LGTs with such PEPS thanks to the analogy, based on sign problem-free variational Monte-Carlo; (3) apply these methods numerically to challenging, non-perturbative models, culminating in SU(3) in 3+1-D, with finite fermionic density, towards quantum chromodynamics. This is expected to overcome the sign problem of such models, thus closing an important, challenging and long-standing gap in the field of non-perturbative physics in general, and gauge theories in particular. The developed methods can be generalized for studying real-time dynamics of quantum field theories, models of quantum gravity, thermal quantum field theories and many other puzzling questions. They will also advance the parallel contemporary approach to LGT - quantum simulations and computations - as some open problems are shared by both approaches.",1943379,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Physical Sciences
AI-Driven Inference for Gravitational Waves: Accelerating Discoveries in Fundamental Physics,"This research combines two timely topics in modern science: gravitational waves and artificial intelligence (AI). It uses AI tools to analyze gravitational-wave data and uncover secrets about our universe.

Gravitational waves are a key prediction of Einstein's revolutionary theory of gravity proposed in 1915. This theory, called general relativity, tells us that gravity is really geometry---a manifestation of the joint curvature of space and time. It describes new phenomena including black holes, neutron stars, and an evolving universe. Gravitational waves are waves of space and time that are produced by extraordinarily powerful cosmic events, like the merging of black holes and neutron stars. A century after Einstein's prediction, we finally detected these waves on Earth using an experiment called the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Gravitational waves carry information about their source. By analyzing them and comparing to theoretical predictions, we learn about the events that produced them. For black hole mergers, we learn the black hole masses and spins, and also the position and orientation of the system. So far, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has detected over 90 such events; combining them we learn about the expansion of the universe, the physics of gravity and extreme matter, and the formation of black holes.

This research has three main goals: (1) develop AI tools to analyze gravitational-wave data more quickly and accurately, (2) use these tools to study the data and make new discoveries in astrophysics and cosmology, and (3) use gravitational waves to test our understanding of gravity and fundamental physics.

We have already seen promising results. My collaborators and I have shown that AI tools can reliably reduce analysis times from hours or days to mere seconds while maintaining accuracy. Our approach involves training neural networks to encode theoretical models in such a way that the networks can quickly interpret new data when it arrives. This approach, known as neural simulation-based inference, is a game-changer for scientific data analysis, and the proposed research aims to develop and apply these methods throughout gravitational wave astronomy. Our plans include continued research on ground-based detectors such as the LVK and the future Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer; new research on space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, which will observe supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies; research on combining multiple observations using AI tools to learn about populations of black holes and cosmology; AI research adapting state-of-the-art image generation tools to scientific data; and a study to understand in exquisite detail the final stages of a merger-the ringdown-as the combined object settles to a steady-state black hole.

This research will benefit a variety of groups, including the gravitational-wave research community through open-source software development for data analysis. Additionally, the general relativity community will gain from an improved theoretical understanding of black holes. Our work will also benefit the AI for science community by developing new methods and applying them to solve highly challenging problems. Finally, our project showcases the potential of AI in scientific data analysis and offers a valuable training opportunity for young researchers, contributing to the wider scientific community and UK workforce.",1924644,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
The materials approach to quantum spacetime,"The effects of gravity are known to all of us: responsible both for falling apples and planetary orbits, but it remains the least well-understood force in nature. An open question in our conceptualization of gravity regards whether information is destroyed in gravitational processes.

Black holes, formed from the collapse of stars, are a beautiful testing ground for these ideas. Consider a diary, containing deeply personal secrets that must be kept from public view at all costs. Is it possible to destroy the information contained within by throwing the diary into a black hole? While this might seem useful in practice, the implications for fundamental physics would be disastrous. A self-consistent physical theory should not allow for information destruction, as this would imply a basic inability to predict the outcomes of experiments; negating the entire paradigm of the scientific method and the validity of hypothesis testing. Cue Hawking's information paradox, which definitively shows that, within the framework of Einstein's general relativity, black holes do indeed destroy information. This suggests that we must search for a theory that can replace Einstein's general relativity, while nevertheless reproducing all of its successful predictions in the realm of astronomy and cosmology. This is a daunting but necessary task.

Black holes are not the only realm where Einstein's equations reveal inconsistencies: astronomical surveys suggest that our universe is expanding, and similarly to black holes, an expanding universe potentially destroys the information in the diary, if left alone for eons. If we are to understand the origins of our expanding universe, it is imperative that we build theoretical models that accurately describe expanding space without the problematic information loss.

To get at the crux of the information paradox, I am looking at frameworks that could eventually replace general relativity. My approach is to treat the fabric of space as a `material' to be experimented on. Of course, being a theoretical physicist means that my experiments will be `thought-' or `gedanken-' experiments, but nonetheless Einstein's equations reveal that under certain conditions, or in the presence of certain types of matter, spacetime exhibits phase transitions, much like how water turns to gas if the temperature and pressure are tuned beyond specific values. My goal is to use such thought experiments to guide a search for new microscopic theories that will provide a better understanding of the fabric of the universe and its cosmic origins. These new theories will still describe the known features of gravity, but without the problematic information loss, and simultaneously have the potential to reveal new undiscovered properties of spacetime and our universe.",1920834,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Particle and High Energy Physics
Research in Classical and Quantum Gravity,"This award supports research in gravitational physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum theory. The resulting theory is called “quantum gravity” and is needed to understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this award will use the latest techniques and tools to try to answer some of these fundamental problems. An essential part of this award is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to informing media reporters, the Principal Investigators will disseminate the directions and results of their research to a broad audience. Society at large will benefit by increasing their understanding of science and the world they live in. This award involves three related programs of research. PI Horowitz will explore black holes at very low temperatures in more general situations than has been done before. This will include breaking some spatial symmetry (both with and without a cosmological constant) and including quantum corrections to general relativity. It has recently been shown that these black holes can have much larger tidal forces near their horizon than previously thought. PI Horowitz will investigate new examples and look for possible astrophysical applications. PI Marolf will explore evidence for and implications of the idea that gravitational systems have a finite density of states, meaning that in a finite region of space, they can have only a finite number of states with energy less than any chosen value. While this idea would explain the thermodynamic properties of black holes, it is well known to fail in perturbative treatments of quantum gravity. In particular, one can find black hole geometries with arbitrarily large volumes of space behind the horizon, and which can thus hold arbitrary numbers of independent states. A focus of PI Marolf’s work will be the study of toy models in which the density of states in the full theory is much smaller than that of the naive perturbative theory. Horowitz and Marolf will both study possible definitions of quantum gravity associated with Feynman’s reformulation of quantum mechanics as a sum of all possible histories. For gravitational systems, such histories are entire spacetimes and so are associated with both geometry and topology. If one considers positive definite metrics, the sum over topologies has recently been argued to lead to the above-described finite density of states. But relativity teaches us that the metric of a physical spacetime is not positive definite, and the desired so-called Lorentz-signature metrics are not compatible with general such topologies. This tension will be explored from a variety of viewpoints. The methods employed in all three programs of research will be primarily analytic, though these will be supplemented with numerical calculations on desktop computers.

Examining the Shape of Proton Emitting Nuclei,"What is the shape of the nucleus in the moments before it emits a proton? How does the shape of the nucleus change when the proton becomes unbound? In this project, I will answer these questions by performing the first laser spectroscopy studies on proton-emitting nuclei - bringing a powerful technique into a new research domain.

At the edges of the nuclear landscape, a rare form of radioactive decay occurs where the nucleus emits a proton. Studying proton-emitting nuclei with laser spectroscopy provides a new and exciting opportunity to test the fundamental properties of the nuclear force. With several new international facilities starting up, it is an opportunity that has not been possible until now.

Laser spectroscopy measures the hyperfine structure of atoms, an atomic fingerprint that allows nuclear properties (e.g. spin, electromagnetic moments and charge radii) to be measured in a nuclear-model- independent way. For example, the charge radius tells us about the proton distribution in the nucleus i.e. its shape. By measuring nuclei across the proton-drip line (beyond which proton decay occurs), we can understand the effect of the proton on the nucleus before it is emitted and gain a unique insight into how this single proton can influence the behaviour of the whole nucleus.

These measurements will be compared to state-of-the-art nuclear theories which will provide a powerful test of said theories, allowing us to constrain the nuclear wave function and provide a significant insight into the complex system that is the nucleus.",1918846,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Reconstruction of global redox transitions based on an evolving Precambrian biological carbon pump,"The history of life on Earth is intricately tied to the story of molecular oxygen (O2). Given that we breath O2 every day, the quest to understand its rise over billions of years is inherently tied to the fundamental question of our existence. However, critical turning points in our planet’s oxygenation, including the Great Oxidation Event, continue to escape our full comprehension. 
O2’s narrative involves a complex interplay of microbial life, biogeochemical processes, and geological factors, all intricately woven into the carbon cycle. Within the web of transformations, a black hole persists: the Biological Carbon Pump (BCP). The BCP is a crucial component of the Earth's carbon cycle, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere and transferring it to the ocean depths for burial over geological timescales. This burial process directly impacts global O2 levels, making the understanding of the ancient BCP crucial for unlocking Earth's oxygenation mysteries.
However, deciphering how the ancient BCP functioned is challenging, as insights from the modern BCP, which is predominantly shaped by complex life forms, offer limited guidance when it comes to understanding its ancient counterpart, which operated in a world ruled by microorganisms. RETRO-PUMP sets out to unveil the secrets of the Precambrian BCP by reconstructing an ancient and evolving BCP with the goal of unravelling its regulation of O2 levels. It challenges the conventional view of a less efficient Precambrian BCP and explores uncharted relationships between microbial carbon cycling and major O2 transitions. This journey follows a simulated ocean pipeline, from the sunlit photic zone to the deep ocean, culminating in an integration of insights into a numerical framework. By tackling the drivers behind Earth’s oxygenation, RETRO-PUMP has substantial implications for understanding how the interplay of biological and geological factors ultimately paved the way for the rise of complex life as we know it today.",1917470,2025,2030,ERC,Germany,EU,Earth Sciences; Astronomical Sciences
Dimensionality tuning of strongly correlated van-der-Waals materials: a route to multifunctional quantum devices,"Dimensionality is hugely important in low-temperature physics, the study of materials and the behaviour of electrons and other excitations in solid crystals. The underlying mathematics and the resulting observed behaviour of a material or system is hugely and fundamentally different and exotic if its character becomes two-dimensional rather than the familiar 3D. Even more fascinating and elusive is the fuzzy halfway ground of how a system behaves as it is pushed from one regime to the other - '2.5D'. 

A nascent revolution in alternatives to silicon-based electronics is increasingly turning to the physics of 2D materials to design new devices to overcome the challenges of ever-increasing miniaturisation and an ever-mounting drive to become more energy efficient. 2D layered crystals have unique advantages in this regard, as they can be cleanly and easily thinned down to single layers of atoms (as with the famous example of graphene), then stacked together in nigh-unlimited complex configurations to combine their exotic properties.

To design and use these systems at an application level, it is essential that the underlying physics, and with it both the limitations and possibilities intrinsic to the materials are fundamentally understood and tested. Furthermore, this research can inform potential new avenues to explore and the synthesis of new designer materials to fulfil established criteria.

A large volume of recent work on low-dimensional physics has focused on thickness control, to tune towards the `true 2D' limit of the atomic monolayer. A complementary approach is to tune the interactions from 2D to 3D by applying hydrostatic pressure - an extremely clean and powerful tuning parameter in a van-der-Waals (vdW) material. These materials are formed of strongly-bonded flat planes of atoms, linked only by the extremely weak van-der-Waals chemical bond - akin to static electric attraction. Applying pressure to such a system overwhelmingly has the effect of pushing the crystal planes together, strengthening bonds between them and allowing ever-increasing crosstalk. This will often have profound effects on the conductivity and magnetism seen in the system, including the discovery of exotic new states of matter.

I will use extremes of low temperature, high pressure, magnetic and electric fields to search for new functional and multifunctional quantum materials and tune existing systems into novel states, focussing on fundamental properties of transport and of magnetic and charge order in 2D materials. I will focus on fundamental properties of transport and magnetism in low-dimensional van-der-Waals materials, and then to nanoscale devices built from stacking individual atomic layers of different 2D materials together.

Extreme-conditions tuning of these nanodevices is a completely new and exciting research direction that brings together two very different fields of research with essentially no overlap - my unique background across these two areas, and quantum computing, will allow me to build a new interdisciplinary programme to explore exciting new physics. 

These devices additionally harbour great potential for new technologies as well as blue-skies science interest. I am partnering with industry, and academic collaborators in electrical engineering, chemistry and materials science, to explore pathways to practical applications of the new materials, behaviours and architectures to be discovered. Potential uses are in new times of electronics and memory such as spintronics or low-power transistors, flexible electronics and precision sensors. I will also look to harness the exotic 'topological' properties of new 2D materials to build fault-tolerant new qubits for quantum computing, drawing on my expertise and contacts in this field.",1905211,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Noble Dark Matter Searches at the Low Energy Frontier,"It is well-established that there exists a mysterious, non-luminous mass component in our Universe. In 1933, Fritz Zwicky determined that galaxies rotating in the Coma Cluster were moving much faster than expected from the gravitational pull of the visible matter; this was the first piece of evidence to point towards an additional non-visible, mass component in our Universe. Zwicky measured approximately 10 times more mass than the total mass of the visible matter. Since then, there has been a flurry of astrophysical and cosmological evidence to support this argument, which indicates that the visible matter in our Universe, which is accounted for in our Standard Model of particle physics, only makes up 5% of the total energy density of the Universe. The evidence suggests that up to 25% of the Universe is comprised of this mysterious, ""dark matter"", however it is yet to be experimentally detected. The nature of dark matter is therefore one of the biggest mysteries in modern-day particle physics; its discovery is critical in understanding the origin of the universe, as well as unlocking the door to a new era on particle physics. As such, there is growing excitement within the astroparticle physics community to find dark matter, with many experiments currently searching for direct evidence of a dark matter particle interaction.

So far, there has been no experimental evidence of dark matter. However, experiments are continuing to push the boundaries to rule out a variety of dark matter candidates. One class of dark matter candidates that has yet to be searched for is ""light"" dark matter, which is predicted to have a smaller mass than most current experiments are typically designed to search for. As a Future Leader Fellow, I have designed a comprehensive and exciting research programme that will search for this experimentally-unexplored light dark matter, using a combination of both the largest dark matter experiment under construction to date, DarkSide-20k (DS20k), and one of the smallest, QUEST-DMC. These experiments search for evidence of a dark matter particle scattering from a target atom, using liquid noble gases as their target media. Since DarkSide-20k and QUEST-DMC use different target media, they have the potential to explore different dark matter models and mass ranges, and therefore between the two experiments, there is the very real possibility of a dark matter discovery. The programme will use sophisticated data analysis techniques combined with cutting-edge quantum sensor technology to unlock the potential of both experiments, striving to achieve world-leading sensitivity to a range of light dark matter candidates. 

The impact of this programme is significant: if light dark matter is not discovered in this search, a large fraction of light dark matter candidates will have been ruled out, which is knowledgeable and important insight for next-generation dark matter detectors. In addition to the scientific impact, the development of enhanced quantum sensor technology required for this programme will have substantial implications on future detector designs for dark matter and other low-energy physics searches, and serves to benefit the wider community outside of astroparticle physics who require leading-edge quantum sensors.",1900712,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
FuSe2 Topic 3: Ultrafast Energy Efficient Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions,"Nontechnical The energy consumption associated with computing has increased dramatically in the past decade due to rapid development of new technologies, where a substantial amount of energy is wasted in the standby state of modern transistors. In this project, the team explores a novel class of devices based on a special quantum mechanical property of electrons called spin. Information stored by spins can last even after the power is turned off, enabling development of highly efficient memory or logic devices. This team studies devices where the spins in magnetic materials point in different directions, resulting in a zero net magnetization. In these so-called antiferromagnetic devices, very interesting properties such as large on/off ratio and energy efficient operation have been predicted. This project combines theoretical research to identify the best antiferromagnetic systems and unveil new physical mechanisms with experimental fabrication and characterization of their unique properties and implementation in computer memory systems. This project supports at least six Ph.D. students and offers research experiences to undergraduate students in all three participating universities. The workforce development and outreach plans include development of new degree programs and hosting teachers from Title I high schools. Technical An emerging class of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on antiferromagnets (AF-MTJ) is explored in this project. The principal investigators study novel AF-MTJs with a holistic codesign approach, where physics, materials, device and system-level research are synergistically integrated. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) - compatible processes are employed to fabricate AF-MTJs on (earth-abundant) Si wafers, making results of this project ready to be transferred to industry. In addition to the investigation of the new tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) phenomenon based on momentum-dependent spin polarization, the PIs investigate spin-transfer torques (STT) and voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effects in AF-MTJs. This project focuses on antiferromagnetic materials with noncollinear spin configurations, where large TMR ratios have already been predicted by the team through first-principles calculations. Combinatorial growth of films and wafer-level structural and magnetic characterization are employed to enable rapid identification of the best materials. In addition, TMR, STT and VCMA effects with direct currents are probed by a unique method based on conducting atomic force microscopy in sub-100nm devices that can be rapidly fabricated, providing very useful insight for the subsequent RF characterization of fully patterned devices in the dynamic region down to 100ps.

The possibility of artificial life at subzero temperatures: the role of water in cell-mimicking compartments,"In the last few decades, researchers have come to believe that where there is liquid water, there is life, regardless of the physical conditions of the surroundings. Indeed, living organisms have been discovered in environments with extreme temperatures, radiation, or high salinity. In terms of temperature, the lowest limit to sustain the metabolic activities of bacteria is reported to be -20 ºC in permafrost. Yet, the survival mechanism of life below the freezing point of water is still not fully understood, though it has important implications for origin of life studies and the search for life in the universe.
The prerequisite of life at subzero temperatures is the existence of liquid water. Intracellular liquid water not only serves as solution medium, but also plays a crucial role in biological processes such as metabolisms in cells. Therefore, understanding the physical state of intracellular water at subzero temperatures is important. 
In ArtWater, we will employ synthetic compartments as model system to investigate the physical state of compartmentalized water at subzero temperatures. The project will be conducted through a bottom-up approach: from pure water in compartments to crowded compartmentalized solutions that mimic cytoplasm in natural cells. The crystallization, diffusion, and dynamics of water will be studied by differential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy, respectively. Several types of state-of-the-art synthetic compartments will be employed including polymersomes, liposomes, and complex coacervates. Furthermore, we will develop artificial cells equipped with liquid water enabling biological activities at subzero temperatures. The ArtWater project will not only open the window for understanding the survival mechanisms at extremely low temperatures but also provide a new platform for tunable bioengineering processes such as cryopreservation and cryo-enzymology and shed light to astrobiology.",1893662,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Optimization of Radio Detectors of Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos through Deep Learning and Differential Programming,"Detection of neutrinos at ultra-high energies (UHE, E >10^17eV) would be one of the most important breakthroughs in astroparticle physics in the 21st century and would open a new window to the most violent phenomena in our universe. Radio detection remains the only viable technique at these energies. 
However, owing to the expected small flux of UHE neutrinos, the detection rate will be small, with just a handful of events per year, even for large future facilities like the IceCube-Gen2 neutrino observatory at the South Pole. 
In this project, I will enhance the science capabilities of UHE neutrino detectors substantially by increasing the detection rate of neutrinos and improving the quality of each detected event, using recent advances in deep learning and differential programming. I will replace the threshold-based trigger foreseen for future detectors with neural networks, increasing the detection rate of UHE neutrinos by a factor of two at negligible additional hardware costs. I will perform an end-to-end optimization using differential programming and deep learning to improve the determination of the neutrino direction and energy.
My previous work on developing state-of-the-art MC simulation codes, my experience in data analysis, designing reconstruction algorithms and deep learning, and my leadership role in IceCube-Gen2 will enable this ERC project.
The timing of this project is perfect for influencing IceCube-Gen2 - the largest facility for astroparticle physics with neutrinos for the next decade - whose construction is planned to start in 2027. With this ERC project, IceCube-Gen2 will be able to expedite the discovery of UHE neutrino fluxes by up to a factor of five, see sources from deeper in our Universe increasing the observable volume by a factor of three, and measure the neutrino-nucleon cross-section at EeV energies with 3x smaller uncertainty. Hence, NuRadioOpt will substantially increase the capabilities of future observatories for UHE neutrinos.",1882130,2024,2029,ERC,Sweden,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
The first multi-messenger detection of a supermassive black hole binary,"Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers. They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in time-domain surveys, or from strong gravitational waves (GWs) by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), making them exceptional multi-messenger sources. Despite their expected ubiquity, they have remained undetected, but upcoming data of unprecedented quantity and quality from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and increasingly more sensitive PTAs will bring these multi-messenger monsters (MMMonsters) within reach.

MMMonsters at the intersection of astronomy and data science is an ambitious program to deliver the first multi-messenger detection of a SMBHB. Leveraging existing time-domain data, we will improve SMBHB searches advancing our understanding of binary signals and quasar noise. For the first time, we will search for more complex and likely more common non-sinusoidal periodicity. Using the LSST Data Previews, I will develop novel machine learning tools to capitalize on the LSST dataset. With advance preparation, MMMonsters will be poised to reliably detect binaries in the first few LSST data releases, making the project extremely timely and impactful.

On the GW side, I will pave the way for the first PTA detection of an individually resolvable binary. I will build novel PTA detection pipelines that directly incorporate EM data, from a catalog of 20 million galaxies (which we will compile) including all the potential binary hosts. My approach will accelerate the first detection of a SMBHB and allow the subsequent identification of the binary host galaxy. I will forge the ultimate boost in binary detectability through the joint analysis of time- domain and PTA data in a multi-messenger data stream.

MMMonsters will establish strong EU leadership in time-domain astronomy and GW physics through groundbreaking results and by training early career scientists in the emerging field of multi-messenger astrophysics.",1852936,2024,2029,ERC,Greece,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Decoding Dark Matter with Stellar Streams from Beyond the Milky Way,"One of the key questions driving astrophysics research today is the nature of dark matter, which comprises 80% of the matter in the Universe. Stellar streams are sensitive to the distribution of dark matter and to the population of dark matter subhalos in galaxies, both of which depend on the mass and interactions of the dark matter particle. My proposed work will use the wealth of incoming stellar stream data materializing over the next five years from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and the Euclid Space Telescope to measure dark matter halo masses, shapes and concentrations, as well as subhalo populations of external galaxies. I will lead a fundamental shift in the approach to stellar stream studies through statistical model-to-data comparisons between theoretical predictions from various dark matter candidates (cold, warm, wave-like, self-interacting) and the actual stream data. To achieve this goal, I will develop novel numerical techniques which model and fit multiple streams at once in multiple external galaxies, run state-of-the-art N-body simulations of disrupting globular clusters in dwarf galaxies to place theoretical constraints on the expected substructure, and carry out statistical comparisons between dark matter models and properties derived from the stellar stream data. I will rule out dark matter candidates that are inconsistent with the new stellar stream data, and by the end of the 60-month grant period, I will have the world-leading constraints on dark matter from stellar streams. This work provides an innovative method for mapping the otherwise invisible dark matter, and will constrain statistical properties of dark matter related to its nature and possible extensions of the standard model of particle physics.",1825858,2024,2029,ERC,Denmark,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Deep Waves: Accelerating Wave Dark Matter simulations with physics-informed deep learning & constraining Wave Dark Matter models with MeerKAT deep HI surveys,"Many astrophysicial and cosmological phenomena in our universe are consistent with the existence of a new nonluminous, noninteracting Dark Matter (DM). Although DM comprises 85% of matter in the universe, its nature remains almost completely unknown. While a wide array of terrestrial experiments are used to search for particle DM, each of these searches focus on discovering or excluding a particular theory of DM in a narrow region of parameter space. However, the observable Universe also acts as a multi-faceted DM detector, as the specific nature of Dark Matter determines the distribution of matter in galaxies and at the cosmological scale. Data from cosmological searches is essential to constrain the phase space of DM models, but observational predictions for alternate models of DM are lacking compared to Cold DM simulations. This is especially true for the case of Wave DM, where nonlinear interference effects can leave a distinct signature in the matter power spectrum and small scale structure. However, because no large scale cosmological simulation of Wave DM exists, most limits on Wave DM models ignore these effects, despite the fact that they may solve some of the small-scale diversity problems observed with CDM. Given the sheer number of terrestrial experiments searching for Wave DM2, accurate cosmological limits will be crucial for exploring the model phase space and defining future searches for Dark Matter. The Deep Waves project will enhance cosmological studies of DM by 1) developing high-volume simulations to study alternate CDM models, accelerated with physics-informed neural networks and 2) search for DM signatures in astrophysical surveys.",1817324,2024,2029,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"Geometry and analysis for (G,X)-structures and their deformation spaces","The study of geometric structures on manifolds finds its inspiration in Klein’s Erlangen Program from 1872, and has seen spectacular developments and applications in geometric topology since the work of Thurston at the end of the 20th century. Geometric structures lie at the crossroads of several disciplines, such as differential and algebraic geometry, low-dimensional topology, representation theory, number theory, real and complex analysis, which makes the subject extremely rich and fascinating. 
In the context of geometric structures of pseudo-Riemannian type, the study of submanifolds with special curvature conditions has been very effective and led to some fundamental questions, such as the open conjectures of Andrews and Thurston from the 2000s, and the recently settled Labourie’s Conjecture. This project aims to obtain important results in this direction, towards four interconnected goals: 
1. the study of quasi-Fuchsian hyperbolic manifolds, in particular leading to the proof of a strong statement that would imply the solution of the conjectures of Andrews and Thurston; 
2. the achievement of curvature estimates of L^2-type on surfaces in Anti-de Sitter space; 
3. the construction of metrics of (para)-hyperKähler type on deformation spaces of (G,X)-structures, and the investigation of their properties; 
4. the study of existence and uniqueness of special submanifolds of dimension greater than 2 in pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces. 
The project adopts an innovative approach integrating geometric and analytic techniques, and the results will have remarkable applications for Teichmüller theory and Anosov representations. 
In the long term, the proposed methodology and the expected results will lead to further developments in various related directions, for instance: the study of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of variable negative curvature, of higher dimensional pseudo-hyperbolic manifolds, and the deformation spaces of other types of (G,X)-structures.",1815179,2024,2029,ERC,Italy; France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Center: CCI Phase I: NSF Center for Multimodal Observations for Single Atom Imaging of Chemistry (MOSAIC),"The NSF Center for Multimodal Observations for Single Atom Imaging of Chemistry (MOSAIC) is supported by the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program of the Division of Chemistry. The ability to visualize chemical reactions at the single-atom level and in real time would be truly transformative to the field of chemistry. Scientific achievements in this area would allow scientists to understand reaction mechanisms and the relationships between molecular structures and their properties at previously inaccessible resolutions. MOSAIC will achieve these goals via 1) the nanofabrication of novel liquid cells with enhanced functionality and 2) the coupling of these liquid cells with electron microscopy to reveal new insights into chemical reactions at a range of scales, from atoms to clusters to 2D materials. Activities within this center will include collaboration with a wide range of companies to commercialize the MOSAIC platforms and rotations for mentees between different institutions to broaden scientific expertise. The center will utilize various programs to recruit and support underrepresented students. Public science communication and outreach will be enhanced through programs such as the “South Side Science Festival” and collaboration with some of the largest science museums in the country, as well as the creation of educational multimedia materials in collaboration with school districts and public libraries. MOSAIC’s real-time, single-atom level visualization will elucidate (i) reaction mechanisms at the finest level, such as the atomic or molecular configuration of intermediates, the pathways by which intermediates are converted into products, and rate-limiting steps in those pathways, and (ii) how properties change with the instantaneous atomistic structures during reactions or in response to external stimuli. Achieving breakthroughs in the visualization of chemical reactions at the single-atom level and in real time will depend upon the development of specialized liquid cell platforms with enhanced capabilities in scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). MOSAIC will employ nanofabrication to permit the spatial control of liquid cell compartments, the thickness of the liquid, and the geometry of viewing windows, thereby allowing quantitative and high-resolution analysis of chemical reactions. MOSAIC will utilize these novel liquid cell platforms in a highly integrated research program that focuses on single-atom catalysis, cluster chemistry, nanocrystal synthetic chemistry, and surface coatings on 2D membranes using organic molecules with surface-specific reactivities. Liquid cell platforms will also be integrated with cutting-edge capabilities in S/TEM, such as atomic-resolution vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with chemical sensitivity to visualize bonds and valence states of elements, 4D-STEM to map structures and chemical bonding, and electron tomography for 3D structures. The data analysis approach and chemical interpretations will benefit from theory-guided information extraction using artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and density functional theory modeling.

A Gamma-ray Infrastructure to Advance Gravitational Wave Astrophysics,"When galaxies merge, do their central supermassive black holes also merge?  How does the merger affect star formation and the evolution of galaxies? How does physics beyond the Standard Model of particles affect the Universe? The detection and characterisation of low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) will address these fundamental and longstanding questions of astronomy and cosmology. 

Supermassive black holes at the centres of merging galaxies are expected to form binary systems whose orbital motion generates GWs. A cosmological population of such systems combine to build up a GW background (GWB). Such a GWB is also expected if the Universe went through an inflationary period, providing a GW map just moments after the Big Bang. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), which are ensembles of extremely stable millisecond pulsars (rotating neutron stars), can be used to study this GWB. 

Searches for the GWB have typically used sensitive radio telescopes. However, radio data exhibit complex noise processes, predominantly arising from the interstellar medium (ISM), that limit its sensitivity and introduce bias. Gamma rays are immune to the effects of the ISM and a gamma-ray PTA can overcome several of the limitations affecting radio data. GIGA will (a) establish a gamma-ray PTA and independently detect the GWB, (b) develop advanced inference techniques to distinguish its astrophysical origins, (c) measure properties of the ISM through multiwavelength studies, and (d) explore energy-dependent couplings of dark matter. Through these avenues, GIGA will also maximise the sensitivity of radio PTAs and provide crucial validation of their measurements.

The detection of the GWB will provide the first stringent constraints on the dynamical evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies while advanced inferences techniques will aid in disentangling weaker astrophysical sources including cosmic strings and phase transitions, thus probing physics beyond the Standard Model.",1795301,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands; Germany,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Sweet Origins of Life:  Peering into the Past with Today’s Biochemistry,"Approximately four billion years ago, chemical and geological processes on the ancient Earth caused a continuous increase in the complexity of organic molecules, ultimately leading to RNA, DNA, proteins, polysaccharides, membrane-forming amphipaths, to metabolism and the roots of biology. But how did it all begin? How did chemistry become biology? There are many indications to the starting point, i.e., the huge set of small molecules that existed on early Earth, as well as the end point of chemical evolution - which is the beginning of biology and the first living organisms. In order to unravel the gap of what happened in between, it is crucial to analyze plausible routes to the origin of life. While much effort to date in the context of formation of primordial polymers has focused on the generation of nucleic acids, and to a lesser extent the formation of peptides, the role of sugars in the chemical origins of life has never been investigated - outside the roles of sugars as structural elements of nucleic acids and in metabolism.
Sugars are ubiquitous biomolecules, providing an energy source, taking part in biosynthesis, providing structural support, and even acting as catalysts. Sugars are often found in conjugation with other biomolecules (e.g., glycolipids). I hypothesize that the tightly intertwined biological dependencies of sugars and other biopolymers, and their mutualistic relationships, reflect a long co-evolutionary process. The main goal of this proposal is to bridge the gap from early prebiotic chemistry to today’s complex biochemistry by studying mutually catalytic networks involving sugars. Following our preliminary findings which successfully demonstrated the formation of oligomers composed of sugars and amino acids, my team will generate and characterize a multitude of heterogenous glycan-containing conjugates - and study their emergent assembly and function. This study will furnish a deep understanding of how and why life’s biochemistry emerged.",1774762,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Biological Sciences; Philosophy and Religious Studies; Astronomical Sciences
Towards constraining the pillars of our cosmological model using combined probes,"Despite the observational successes of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, a number of its key ingredients remain unknown. Imminent surveys promise to yield unprecedented constraints on these components, thus making precision tests of ΛCDM a first-time reality.
In PiCo, my team and I will focus on two fundamental questions in modern physics that can only be answered through cosmological observations: What mechanism gave rise to the primordial fluctuations seeding all the structures seen in the Universe today? What is the cause for the Universe’s late-time accelerated expansion? 
We will address these by developing novel analysis techniques built on the complementarity of cosmological probes and advanced statistical methods. These are designed to harness the rich information contained in non-Gaussian, small-scale features of cosmic fields, while enabling precise constraints on ΛCDM, robust to systematic uncertainties dominating high-precision data. Focusing on two of the most powerful probes of the next decade, galaxy clustering and galaxy clusters, we will constrain the mechanisms driving the accelerated expansion through the first joint simulation-based inference analysis of galaxy clusters selected through the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and weak lensing. In addition, we will derive constraints on primordial fluctuations in a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and CMB lensing angular two- and three-point statistics. 
Capitalizing on my past work, we will develop these methods using simulations and current data, before applying them to galaxy data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time and CMB data from the Simons Observatory, two upcoming high-precision experiments I am deeply involved in. PiCo will deliver tight constraints on the key ingredients of ΛCDM and will thus contribute to understanding if this model provides a complete description of our Universe, or if it is time for a paradigm shift in cosmology.",1769464,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Unravelling the first Babbles of the Earth Inner Core History,"The existence of Earth's inner core was a major discovery almost a century ago, and since then the timing of its nucleation remains highly debated. This major event in the Earth’s history enhanced the energy necessary to maintain the magnetic field to the present-day, making our planet habitable. Earth has thus escaped the fate of planets like Mars that lost its protective shield. While the community agreed to place the inner core formation at ~600 million years ago in the Ediacaran Period, new evidence of a change in the Earth’s magnetic field regime during the Mid-Paleozoic (416–332 Ma) challenge this hypothesis: Can we better constrain the Earth inner core history? UBEICH will tackle this issue with a new kind of experimental data describing the long-term evolution of the Earth’s dynamo strength. In paleomagnetism, the conventional approaches fail to retrieve ancient magnetic signal from old rocks due to their weathering along their complex geological history. To this end, I will develop a promising but challenging multispecimen-single crystal paleointensity. This pioneering approach can significantly increase the number of observations by extracting the magnetic signal from the protected nanometric magnetic inclusion in silicate crystals with the multispecimen technique developed for other purposes. By providing challenging-to-obtain but theoretically reliable data, UBEICH has the ambition to bring a new light on the deep Earth history between 1.1 and 0.3 billion years by unravelling the inner core nucleation. Far-reaching implications beyond the Earth’s evolution and the origin of the magnetic field are expected, with new clues about the planetary core evolution of all rocky planets to understand the relationships between thermal evolution, dynamo, and planet habitability. This is of paramount importance at a time where amateur astronomers and scientists are discovering many new exoplanets, and especially super-Earth located in the Habitable Zone of their star.",1768136,2024,2028,ERC,France,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences
ELT-ANDES: A New Dimension in Exoplanet Characterization,"The next major milestone in ground-based astronomy is the construction of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Among the few projects worldwide, the European ELT stands out as the largest and most advanced facility, with a first light currently planned for 2027. Of paramount importance to fully exploit the potential of such a telescope is the development of an instrument suite providing state-of-the-art science capabilities. In this context, the ANDES project intends to build the visible and near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT. This instrument will enable scientific breakthroughs in many areas of astrophysics. The top science priorities for ANDES defined during the Phase A of the project are the study of habitable exoplanets around nearby stars and the variation of the fundamental constants of physics.ANDES will have the capability of probing exoplanets in two different ways: first, by studying exoplanet atmospheres in transmission spectroscopy, i.e. when a planet transits across the disk of its host star. Second, by performing reflected-light spectroscopy of exoplanets that are spatially resolved from their host star. These two techniques will allow astronomers to probe the population of exoplanets in all its diversity, from gaseous giant planets to rocky worlds, and from hot to temperate objects orbiting at various distances from their star. In particular, ANDES will be able to study temperate rocky planets orbiting within the habitable zone of their star, where liquid water may be present at their surface. Molecular constituents of their atmospheres, such as water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and oxygen can be detected both in transmission and reflected light, providing for the first time information on the physical conditions on Earth-like worlds. Even surface features could be probed in reflected light. Moreover, ANDES will also be able to study in details protoplanetary disks, where new planets form, allowing us to greatly improve our understanding of planet formation and evolution processes.Switzerland has been at the forefront of exoplanet research since the first exoplanet discovery 27 years ago by Nobel prize laureates Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. Swiss scientists have naturally been involved in the development of ANDES since the beginning of the project. Switzerland is now an important member of the ANDES Consortium. The Phase B of the project officially started in August 2022. The purpose of the present FLARE application is to fund the Swiss participation until the end of Phase B, which will conclude with the Preliminary Design Review of ANDES, and the start of Phase C. The instrument is currently foreseen to be on sky by 2031.The Swiss contribution covers four areas: 1) the RIZ spectrograph sub-system, 2) the calibration unit, 3) the SCAO-IFU front-end, and 4) the scientific software. In particular, we are leading the design and construction of the RIZ spectrograph, which is one of the main sub-systems of ANDES. While the present FLARE application covers the design phase, we foresee a continuation of the Swiss effort in the next phases until completion of the instrument in 2032. A total FLARE contribution of about 13 MCHF over 10 years is foreseen. This makes Switzerland a major partner in the ANDES Consortium, and will strengthen Swiss excellence in exoplanet science well into the next decade.",1767407,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
QuSeC-TAQS: Noise Engineering For Enhanced Quantum Sensing,"Understanding fundamentally quantum phenomena is of high interest because those phenomena are important in applications that span from quantum information processing to magnetic resonance imaging. This project will explore electronic noise at the quantum scale, what environmental factors control it, and then how to control it by design. In the larger landscape of quantum technology research, this information will enable the design of effective quantum bits for information processing and biomedical sensing applications. Beyond science, this effort will build curricula focused on quantum information science and engineering (QISE) for wide distribution and organize a local QISE-focused workshop on understanding noise at the quantum level. The technical goal of this project is to enable fast, efficient profiling of magnetic noise at the atomic level. Noise at this scale is a critical challenge in the current state of quantum computers and sensors because noise causes decoherence which destroys a qubit’s utility. To deal with said noise, technologists need to understand it: what frequency is the noise, how loud is is, and what causes it. This project, comprising an interdisciplinary chemistry and physics team from University of Colorado Boulder and Colorado State University, will explore a new technique for the efficient characterization of noise and benchmark the new method with both solid-state qubits (like the NV center in diamond) and metal-containing molecules through spectroscopic and theoretical methods. These studies will extend the understanding of magnetic noise to an atomistic level beyond the border of what it currently known. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1750000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Overcoming challenges in the evolution and nature of massive stars,"Massive stars are the cornerstone of the dynamic and chemical evolution of the cosmos, enriching it as they evolve with chemically processed material that is blown away from their surface by energetic winds and eruption processes. Despite their importance, their evolution from cradle to death as spectacular supernova explosions still poses many mysteries due to crucial knowledge gaps in the physical processes taking place in their interior and atmosphere and the mutual influence by close-by siblings. Our ultimate goal is to elucidate the physical properties and evolution of massive stars impacted by companions, as well as their contribution to the generation of gravitational waves. For this, we wish to establish a multidisciplinary, international network of researchers from Europe and America with expertise in various disciplines, and with background in both theory and observations. We will exploit the avalanche of public data archives and develop machine learning algorithms to detect massive stars in binary and multiple systems, classify them, and create statistically meaningful samples for diverse evolutionary states. We will develop progressive methods of signal processing for the analysis of the stellar properties, and cutting-edge numerical codes to unveil the impact of stellar interaction and mass ejection on the evolution of the stars and stellar systems. The acquired results will significantly enhance our knowledge and lead to major advancements in all related fields. The bulk of exchanges will be undertaken by PhD students and Postdocs, whom we will educate and train in modern observing and data analysing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and in high-performance computing, equipping them with excellent skills for their future careers. We will organise schools, workshops and educational activities to share knowledge as well as disseminate our results, which will be major breakthroughs and will expand Europe's leading role in basic research.",1747785,2025,2028,European Commission,Czechia; Chile; Argentina; Argentina; Poland; Argentina; Chile; Germany; United States; Argentina; Brazil; Chile; Brazil; France; Spain; Mexico,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Molecules for Quantum simulation,"In order to fully understand the universe at a quantum level, we can't rely on classical computers. This is because matter is too complicated, for example, materials consist of large numbers of particles all interacting with one another and the computer memory required to calculate the evolution of such a system grows exponentially with the number of particles. A better route is to recreate the system using quantum particles. In this project we will be using ultracold molecules as the basis for a quantum simulator. There currently exist quantum simulators based on trapped ions, Rydberg atoms and superconducting circuits. Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses. Molecules, much like Rydberg atoms, provide an easily scalable route to large numbers of particles. However, molecules have very long-lived states and a rich internal structure. This structure offers different energy scales which can be explored, over 4 orders of magnitude, and the possibility of adding an extra synthetic dimension. In addition, ultracold, controlled molecules can be used for tests of fundamental physics, and studies of quantum chemistry. The techniques demonstrated in this project will contribute to these fields as well.

Over the last decade, techniques have been developed to create very cold clouds of molecules, and recently the first molecules were loaded into individual optical traps - known as tweezers. I am going to build a new experiment, based on these methods, to create arrays of molecules in tweezers. I am going to demonstrate control over the motion of the molecules in tweezers for the first time, such that they are pinned to the minimum of each trap. I will also control the internal quantum state of the molecule - by adding and removing energy from the rotation of the molecule. By doing this I will create what is known as a superposition of rotational states. A superposition is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle can exist in two states at once. In such a superposition, molecules will interact strongly with one another providing the coupling required to simulate a system. I will study this interaction, called the dipole-dipole interaction, and measure its dependency on external parameters such as the geometry of the trap arrays. To truly benefit from the advantages offered by molecules, we want to load them into an optical lattice which has smaller intersite separation (down to half the wavelength of the trapping light i.e. ~400 nm) and can allow for tunnelling between sites as well as the dipole-dipole interaction. This leads to exotic phases which cannot be accessed by other platforms. This will be the next stage of the project, leading to a versatile, programmable quantum simulator.",1746526,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
No time for cosmology: Decoding dynamics from static cosmological correlations,"""The beginnings of the universe are encoded in the statistical properties of primordial perturbations imprinted at the hot Big Bang. Our understanding of primordial cosmology comes from measurements of these imprinted spatial correlations. They form a static pattern, and its apparent lack of causality is elegantly explained by an earlier period of time evolution. This time evolution from very primordial eras of the universe can not be observed directly. For conceptual and practical purposes, a reformulation of cosmological perturbation theory in which time is emergent is of fundamental importance. We hypothesize that there is an intrinsic description of primordial fluctuations that only uses their statistical properties and in which time emerges. Our approach has three steps. First, we propose a systematic development of the theory of """"boundary differential equations"""" for cosmological correlation functions, and the development of new kinematical variables for cosmological correlators. With these tools in hand, we will calculate a large set of ``theoretical data"""": cosmological correlations of many different particles, coming from a variety of early universe scenarios. With this data in hand, we will search for new principles from which time evolution emerges from the static distribution of cosmological perturbations. Having a reformulation of cosmological evolution with emergent time, a glimpse into the possible beginning of our universe might become accessible, as well as its imprint in cosmological correlations.""",1743288,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Universality Phenomena in Geometry and Dynamics of Moduli spaces,"Geometry and dynamics in the moduli spaces proved to be extremely efficient in the study of surface foliations, billiards in polygons and in mathematical models of statistical and solid state physics like Ehrenfest billiards or Novikov's problem on electron transport. Ideas of study of surface dynamics through geometry of moduli spaces originate in works of Thurston, Masur and Veech. The area is flourishing ever since. Contributions of Avila, Eskin, McMullen, Mirzakhani, Kontsevich, Okounkov, Yoccoz, to mention only Fields Medal and Breakthrough Prize winners, made geometry and dynamics in the moduli spaces one of the most active areas of modern mathematics. Moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and related moduli spaces of Abelian differentials are parametrized by a genus g of the surface. Considering all associated hyperbolic (respectively flat) metrics at once, one observes more and more sophisticated diversity of geometric properties when genus grows. However, most of metrics, on the contrary, progressively share certain similarity. Here the notion of “most of” has explicit quantitative meaning, for example, in terms of the Weil-Petersson measure. Global characteristics of the moduli spaces, like Weil-Petersson and Masur-Veech volumes, Siegel-Veech constants, intersection numbers of ψ-classes were traditionally studied through algebra-geometric tools, where all formulae are exact, but difficult to manipulate in large genus. Most of these quantities admit simple uniform large genus approximate asymptotic formulae. The project aims to study large genus asymptotic geometry and dynamics of moduli spaces and of related objects from probabilistic and asymptotic perspectives. This will provide important applications to enumerative geometry, combinatorics and dynamics, including count of meanders in all genera, solution of Arnold’s problem on statistics of random interval exchange permutations, asymptotics of Lyapunov exponents and of diffusion rates of Ehrenfest billiards.",1741744,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
STARs as GRAvitational wave Source Progenitors,"Massive stars are fundamental engines in cosmic evolution, providing strong radiative and kinetic feedback to their environment through their copious ionizing radiation and energetic explosions. They also drive the chemical evolution of their hosts. Despite their importance, large uncertainties remain in our understanding of massive stars, including processes such as mass loss, interactions with close companions, and the formation of compact objects at the end of their evolution. The detection of gravitational waves from merging compact objects introduces an important new avenue to study these processes, with an associated large effort from the astrophysical community to understand both how these sources are formed, and how the observed sample can be used to constrain the existing uncertainties. Key questions that are critical to resolve these problems are:

- Which intermediate phases in the formation of gravitational wave sources can anchor their evolution?
- Can we identify individual progenitors of gravitational wave sources in the nearby universe?
- How do the final properties of a massive star relate to the resulting compact objects they form?

To address these, the STAR-GRASP project aims to produce a novel theoretical framework to connect constraints from electromagnetic observations to the observed sample of gravitational wave sources. To achieve this we will perform extensive simulations of single and binary star evolution, covering their whole life from birth to their final death-throes as merging compact objects. This will provide multiple predictions on the properties of binary systems with at least one compact object, as well as on the electromagnetic transients associated to their formation. Our new theoretical predictions will be testable in the coming decade, with the advent of large-scale multi-epoch surveys of stellar systems and transient electromagnetic events, as well as the rapidly growing sample of observed compact object coalescences.",1713560,2025,2030,ERC,Belgium,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Active galactic nuclei and Population III stars in early galaxies,"The first stars must have started the generation of heavy elements and the formation of the first galaxies in the earliest phases of the Universe. At the same epoch, the seeds of the supermassive black holes which are detected in the centres of all nearby massive galaxies, including our own Milky Way, must have formed. While theoretically predicted, the detection of these first stars and seed black holes is an outstanding observational challenge in modern astronomy. With the proposed APEX project, I will capitalise on two game-changing capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to deliver upon this challenge: (i) the coverage of previously inaccessible wavelengths, and (ii) the power to spectrally and spatially resolve early galaxies and, crucially, their surroundings with the integral-field unit spectrograph NIRSpec. This is decisive to single out the locations of the first stars and black holes through their distinct spectral signatures. With guaranteed JWST observations and the largest approved open-time programme to map galaxy spectra during the first billion years of cosmic time, the APEX team will: 1) search for and characterise the very first stars (Population III) that illuminate the Universe; 2) identify early black holes and measure the masses of active galactic nuclei to constrain supermassive black hole growth; 3) derive the physical properties of the earliest galaxies and study the role of the first stars and black holes in their evolution; 4) accurately compare our data to simulations to significantly improve models of the early Universe. Building on these novel and cutting-edge data and my extensive expertise in integral-field observations, the APEX project comes at the right time to enable a major leap forward in our understanding of the early Universe.",1713016,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Precision Studies of Neutrino Oscillations and Interactions,"Neutrinos are the most abundant matter particle in the universe. As a fundamental particle, they can not be divided into smaller pieces. They also interact only via the Weak Force, meaning they can penetrate astronomical amounts of material without leaving a trace. These three facts make neutrinos a unique and powerful probe to understand how nature works at the smallest scales. Neutrinos are also emerging as a new way to study objects in our universe that are either very far away or obscured by matter. The Standard Model of particle physics classifies the elementary particles into groups of related particles with similar quantum properties and describes the interactions amongst those particles. With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, physicists have found all the particles predicted by the Standard Model, and no other particles have been discovered. However, the model leaves open many questions about the universe, including the existential question of why an excess of matter over antimatter survived the early universe to form the structure of the observable universe. The Standard Model also assumes neutrinos are massless, but we now know that neutrinos do have mass and because they do, they can change from one type to another. This observation tells us there must be more to the Standard Model. This award will provide detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This award will study neutrinos with data from the NOvA and MINERvA experiments. The group is also engaged in R&D for DUNE, the next generation, long-baseline neutrino experiment with detectors at Fermilab in Illinois and the Sanford Underground Laboratory in South Dakota. By engaging students in this research, we provide graduate and undergraduate students a vital component of their education and contribute to the development of the future technical workforce. Beyond promoting science education at the college level, the group operates a successful Emerging Scholars program at a local elementary school. This ten-week, after-school program exposes students who are from communities historically underrepresented in the sciences to practicing physicists and exciting science activities. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1710000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Plumes: Access to the Chemical Makeup of Europa's Presumed Habitats,"Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest the presence of a global subsurface ocean on Europa, Jupiter’s fourth-largest moon. This ocean contains roughly twice the volume of water found in all of Earth's oceans combined. On Earth, oceans are home to ~50-80% of all present life, contain the largest biomass and species-diversity of all of Earth’s habitats, and are home to so-called extremophiles, organisms that not only survive but thrive under extreme conditions (e.g., freezing temperatures, crushing pressures, and complete darkness). Given the likelihood of analogous extreme environments on Europa, such as near-subsurface volcanoes and deep-sea vents, the moon’s ocean stands out as one of the most promising environments in our Solar System to search for signs of life beyond Earth.Discovering life on Europa could revolutionize our understanding of the origin of life. Situated millions of kilometers away from Earth, life on Europa would most likely have formed independently of life on Earth, suggesting that a second genesis happened within our Solar System.  If life independently emerged in two distinct locations around the same star, it implies that life might readily form given the right conditions and that life could subsequently be found abundantly in our galaxy and beyond.Recognizing the significant potential for scientific breakthroughs, both ESA and NASA have decided to devote a dedicated mission to explore Jupiter’s ocean worlds. These missions will closely investigate Europa, with ESA's Jupiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) planning two close flybys (~400 km) and NASA's Europa Clipper mission set to conduct 49 extremely close flybys (> 25 km) of Europa in the years 2031 through 2034. Both missions are equipped with advanced mass spectrometers designed to analyze the chemical composition of encountered gases and particles in situ. Ideally, these instruments could yield valuable insights into the chemical composition of Europa's ocean water, providing crucial information about its potential to support life. The significant hurdle, however, arises from the fact that Europa's ocean is concealed beneath an ice sheet exceeding 10 km in thickness. This virtually places these oceans beyond our immediate reach, necessitating an alternative approach to the analysis of their waters.The alternative approach presents itself through plumes (i.e., geysers) that have been observed to be active on Europa. If fed by Europa’s ocean, plumes present a unique opportunity to collect information about the ocean's chemical composition. A traversing spacecraft equipped with a mass spectrometer could directly sample and analyze the plume material, enabling the inference of oceanic properties in situ. One pressing question to address is: 'If Europa’s ocean is erupting into space in the form of plumes, what insights can samples of these plumes provide regarding the ocean’s composition?'An alternative scenario to consider is that the plumes may not originate from the subsurface ocean but rather from shallow lakes containing salt-enriched water (i.e., brines). Research indicates that these shallow saltwater reservoirs could also serve as suitable environments for organisms, providing alternative habitats to the global ocean. Consequently, another pertinent question to address is: 'If Europa's plumes emanate from shallow lakes, what insights can samples from these plumes offer about potential near-surface habitats on Europa?'Within the framework of this starting grant, these two questions will be tackled by constructing a physical simulation model. This model aims to (i) quantify the change in chemical composition from a plume's liquid reservoir to the plume's gas phase and (ii) enable the deduction of the underlying liquid's chemical composition from a sample of the plume's gas. Following this, the model's results will be employed by the two teams operating mass spectrometers in their respective space missions. This will contribute to the effective preparation for the scheduled plume measurements at Europa and play a crucial role in the subsequent analysis and interpretation of the plume measurements, once available.",1706988,2024,2029,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences
Ultrafast atomic-scale imaging and control of nonequilibrium phenomena in quantum materials,"Quantum materials (QMs) are of great importance for the development of future quantum nanophotonics and nanoelectronic devices. To harness their full potential and design novel functionalities, it is essential to understand how their macroscopic quantum states arise from the microscopic interaction between their charge, lattice, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom, and how they respond to external perturbations. While ultrafast techniques offer unique insight into microscopic interactions at global, macroscopic scales, they fall short of capturing the local response of a many-body quantum state directly at the atomic scale.

In contrast, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) enables imaging of stationary quantum states with angstrom spatial resolution, revealing atomic inhomogeneities, local disorder, or how quantum phases can vary over angstrom scales. Such irregularities are ubiquitous in real devices, and can even be a key feature of technically relevant metastable phases. In these cases, the global understanding of the nonequilibrium response of a quantum state is not sufficient to fully capture its properties, and one must also understand the localized response directly at the relevant spatial - angstrom - scales. Yet, the study of atomically localized nonequilibrium dynamics in QMs has so far been out of reach.

In this proposal, I will employ ultrafast Terahertz-lightwave-driven STM (THz-STM) to (i) explore the response of correlated electron states to global and local perturbations and as a function of their local environment, and (ii) induce new quantum properties by periodic driving with light to create Floquet topological states and study their topological properties at the atomic scale.

FASTOMIC will bridge the gap between atomic real-space and ultrafast real-time investigation of condensed quantum matter, providing scientific insights and technological advances that go significantly beyond existing capabilities.",1702192,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Quantum Physics
Physiological and evolutionary responses of cyanobacteria in a sustainable Mars exploration program,"The world’s major space agencies share a goal of sending humans to Mars within the next few decades. A sustainable human presence there, akin to today’s presence in Antarctica, could generate paradigm-shifting knowledge at an unprecedented pace. One major challenge lies in providing the food, oxygen and other necessary consumables: these cannot be shipped from the Earth over the long term. They should instead be produced on site and for this, Nostocaceae cyanobacteria can be instrumental: fed with materials available in the Martian ground and atmosphere, they could provide feedstock for a range of bioprocesses which, in turn, could produce a wide range of consumables. However, fundamental knowledge is lacking to turn this concept into practical solutions: the physiology of cyanobacteria in the foreseen cultivation conditions is poorly understood. These conditions combine low total pressures, low partial pressures of dinitrogen, interactions with a basaltic substrate from which nutrients are leached, and high concentrations of chaotropic salts.
In the proposed project, I will enable a deep understanding of cyanobacterial physiology in these conditions. For this I will employ a unique approach combining cultivation assays in unique hardware previously developed by my team, adaptive laboratory evolution, cutting-edge omics technologies, the development of a mathematical model which can predict the productivity and efficiency of cyanobacterium cultivation from Martian resources, and the construction of a testbed for the experimental validation of this model. I will use the generated knowledge and tools to design, characterize and demonstrate the viability of bioprocesses which dramatically improve the odds that Mars exploration is done in a sustainable way. Finally, I will adapt the concepts developed for bioproduction on Mars to open new avenues for sustainability on Earth, which I plan to follow up by applying for an ERC Proof of Concept Grant.",1692724,2025,2030,ERC,Germany,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences
Theory to Enable Practical Quantum Advantage,"Quantum computers have already reached a scale that they can fundamentally outperform any conventional supercomputer (often referred to as classical computers) on artificial benchmarking tasks. However, the ultimate goal of the field is to reach practical quantum advantage (PQA), i.e., the point where quantum computers perform otherwise-infeasible useful functions for users beyond the immediate community. For example, a materials scientist or chemist who would calculate properties of novel materials/drugs for screening purposes to forgo expensive laboratory research.

Most hardware companies aim to ultimately build error-corrected quantum computers, however, the implied engineering complexity is so vast that it is generally believed that large-scale, fully quantum-error-corrected machines will not be feasible within a decade or more. Unfortunately, every operation current and near-future machines will perform are substantially flawed, i.e., noisy and thus the most pressing issue currently is: how can we make use of quantum computers that are expected to emerge in the near future and in the early-fault tolerant era?

The overarching objective of this project is to understand and overcome the challenges posed by noisy quantum computers and will deliver key innovations in exploiting early quantum computers that we expect will emerge in the period we call (late) NISQ and early fault tolerant. The project has three distinct but closely interlinked targets that will all play a key role in lowering barriers for practical quantum advantage.

First, the project aims to exploit powerful classical supercomputers in order to enhance the capabilities of noisy quantum computers. In particular, recent developments in classical shadow tomography will be exploited in order to efficiently extract large amounts of information from a quantum computer that is post-processed classically.

Second, error mitigation techniques will be developed that make tradeoffs between accuracy and measurement overhead thereby improving the practicality of noisy quantum computers -- this includes error mitigated classical shadows. Furthermore, one of the goals of this project is to better understand the fundamental limitations of noisy quantum computers with an emphasis on tradeoffs between accuracy and measurement overhead.

Finally, in order to achieve an optimal hardware implementation of quantum algorithms, hardware-level protocols will be developed for improved control of the quantum computer as well as protocols will be tailored to specific hardware architectures.

Ultimately, this project aims to reduce the barriers for achieving practical quantum advantage thereby leading to useful applications of early quantum computers. These applications include, simulating chemical systems for discovering novel drugs, atomistic modelling in materials science to develop novel materials, batteries, solar cells, or performing binary optimisation in logistics. The project is supported by an impressive range of both quantum hardware and software companies.",1690537,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Quantum Physics
New Frontiers of Renormalization,"Renormalization is a fundamental technique that has been used in mathematics (as well as in other disciplines, for example physics) to study systems which display some form of self-similarity. Many systems which display slow chaotic behavior, such as flows on surfaces and piecewise-continuous interval bijections, were successfully analyzed exploiting a 'renormalization operator' which zooms at different scales behavior. A crucial assumption usually needed in these settings is that the renormalization dynamics is recurrent. In this project, we will explore the frontiers of renormalization as a tool to understand slowly chaotic systems: recent breakthroughs (in particular recent work by the PI and collaborators) suggest that even when renormalization is divergent, one can still capture important information on the system by understanding and characterizing the way divergence happens. The new frontiers we want to explore concern in particular two different settings:Setting I: We aim to develop and exploit new renormalization techniques to study KAM-type questions in higher genus. This will allow to attack several fundamental linearization and rigidity open questions concerning higher genus non-linear flows. While renormalization has become a classical tool both in genus one (e.g. in the celebrated theory of circle diffeomorphisms) and for linear flows (successfully studied through Teichmnueller dynamics techniques), breakthroughs in this setting will require non-linear techniques in a setting where renormalization has divergent directions. Setting II: Infinite ergodic theory of parabolic systems: we will study fine chaotic properties of infinite periodic parabolic systems (which include famous models from physics, such as the Ehrenfest windtree model). Contrary to the finite counterparts (such as compact translation surfaces and IETs) these systems are still poorly understood. While the underlying renormalization diverges once lifted to these systems, we aim at developing tools to exploit controlled divergence understand the exceptional recurrent behavior.The project goals addressing long-standing open questions in dynamical systems and ergodic theory; breakthroughs will not only advance the frontiers of our knowledge, but also create a new area of research, bridging between traditionally separated research areas. The project cross-fertilization between different sub-disciplines (such as Teichmueller dynamics, one-dimensional dynamics and infinite ergodic theory) will therefore impact several research communities. The new tools and techniques that we plan to develop are furthermore likely to find a broader applicability in view of the ubiquity of systems which display slowly chaotic behavior and multi-scale features.",1667124,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics
"Topological Matter 2.0: Interacting, Nonlinear, and Dynamical","Almost all of us have experienced our phone getting hot when we use it for too long. This is because the resistance of materials like silicon causes energy to be lost to heat, a key challenge preventing progress in electronics and energy conservation. A revolutionary recent discovery in condensed matter physics promises to solve this problem by providing a mechanism for stabilising desirable material properties against microscopic imperfections. This mechanism is called topological robustness, and it can be compared to a recipe that consistently produces a pleasing meal even if the ingredients are not all quite right.

Topological robustness can give rise to perfect conductivity without the energy losses that plague common materials. In addition to highly efficient electronics, topological robustness also enables a wealth of breakthrough applications ranging from ultra-precise measurement tools to quantum computing. Nevertheless, finding materials that display topological robustness at room temperature has turned out to be immensely challenging, both in the lab and in computer simulations.

With the support of the Future Leaders Fellowship, I will tackle this problem from a fresh perspective: I will generalise topological robustness beyond its current focus on non-interacting electrons - i.e., electrons that do not ""talk to each other"" - in low-temperature materials. I plan to achieve this by building a framework that predicts new topologically robust properties not only in natural materials composed of interacting electrons, but also in artificial metamaterials with nonlinear behaviour, meaning that their response to incoming light is not proportional to the light's intensity. Shifting paradigms even further, I will search for topological robustness in the dynamics of open quantum systems that constantly exchange energy and particles with their environment.

My research will result in new mechanisms for topological robustness across a significantly wider range of scenarios than allowed by existing theories. This research will pave the way for ground-breaking applications in fields as diverse as quantum computing, optoelectronics, sensing, and photovoltaics.",1658626,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Condensed Matter Physics"
High Energy Physics Research at the CMS Experiment,"The Standard Model of particle physics has been a successful theory, agreeing with decades of experimental observations involving weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was further confirmation of this success. However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete theory. Precise measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson at the LHC could provide insight into new physics beyond the Standard Model. This research focuses on exploiting the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to search for new particles, study the decay of Higgs bosons, carry out precision measurements of other Standard Model (SM) processes, use jet substructure to reconstruct high-momentum objects, and extend the capabilities of the CMS particle-tracking detector to increase its acceptance and tolerance to high collision rates. New cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be used for data analysis, detector operations, and reconstruction of collision events. The research activity will also foster collaboration with high school teachers and students through the QuarkNet and Science Olympiad outreach efforts, and foster female participation in STEM disciplines through the university's Women in Science and Engineering initiative. This research will search for subtle signatures of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics using advanced methods for identifying rare signals and addressing systematic uncertainties. These include detailed studies of the properties of the Higgs boson, extending the search program for BSM physics, and systematically improving techniques to maximize the physics potential. This research will also extend the capabilities of the CMS tracking detector to handle conditions at the High Luminosity LHC, extend its geometric coverage, and add tracking information to the far-forward particle flow algorithm. In addition, studies will be performed on the properties of highly Lorentz-boosted SM Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs to fully explore the Higgs coupling to quarks, as well as to search for new phenomena in unexplored signatures at higher masses, such as new heavy vector bosons. This program will also develop and maintain object reconstruction for heavy- and light-flavor jets, as well as perform measurements of SM physics processes including production of W/Z/gamma in association with heavy flavor jets, and detailed understanding of the quantum chromodynamic evolution of jets.

AENEAS: Age-Enabled Exoplanet Science: Understanding the evolution and diversity of planetary systems,"We have detected over 5000 exoplanets in more than 3800 planetary systems. One of the most striking features of the exoplanet population is the remarkable diversity in planet compositions, system architectures and host star characteristics. The origin of this diversity, however, is poorly understood. This is primarily because the vast majority of planets detected to date are reasonably old and have already evolved to become mature planetary systems. It is extremely challenging to study evolutionary processes using systems in which they have already occurred and finished. Furthermore, most planetary systems do not possess measured ages and the vast majority of those that do are neither robust nor precise. Our predominantly old and poorly age dated exoplanet population severely limits our ability to understand how planetary systems evolve into the diverse population we observe.

Significant progress can be made, however, by studying young transiting planet systems (in which evolutionary processes are ongoing), and robustly age dating stars and their planets across the full life cycle of planetary systems. I will (i) build the first statistically powerful sample of young transiting planets with the TESS space mission, (ii) characterise high-value systems in detail by measuring planet masses, orbital obliquities and atmospheric loss rates, (iii) develop a novel method to robustly age date stars (and hence planetary systems) between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr, and (iv) draw these complementary avenues together to construct the first planet occurrence rates as a function of time and to perform the first population level tests of the processes driving planetary system evolution. This programme therefore provides the missing link between our theories of planet formation and early evolution and the mature population of exoplanets. Furthermore, my age dating framework will have far reaching implications for exoplanet, stellar and Galactic astrophysics.",1649426,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
LIGO Instrument and Data Characterization,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. This award supports research in gravitational wave astronomy. The last several years have been very exciting in the field, starting with the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 from a collision of black holes 1.3 billion years ago, and with about 200 detections since then. The LSU group has been a critical contributor to these discoveries. The group's activities in the next years will focus on aspects of characterization of the very complex NSF's Advanced LIGO gravitational wave instruments, as well as the characterization of their data. These efforts are fully integrated with those of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and are closely related to the activities of the LIGO Livingston Observatory, located only 30 miles from the LSU campus. In doing its research, the group will train undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc, who will add to the quality and diversity of the STEM workforce, as well as share the research with the general public. The LSU group will pursue research activities in two main topics, all coordinated with the LSC and key to the improvement of detection rates of gravitational waves with the Advanced LIGO detectors. The first topic is about characterizing the Advanced LIGO detector and applications to future designs; the group will help diagnose and improve the detector's sensing and control of the alignment degrees of freedom. The group will model the performance of the system, compare models with actual performance, and then apply the models and the experience to the conceptual development of such systems for upgraded detectors. The second topic is analyzing data from the Advanced LIGO detector; the group will identify and eliminate when possible instrumental artifacts, in particular those related to the group's expertise on scattering sources. The group will eliminate the cause of the transients when possible and find out the artifacts that most affect them. The group will also work on reducing the effect of these artifacts on the low-latency searches for astrophysical signals in LIGO data.

Non-perturbative Conformal Field Theory in Quantum Gravity and the Laboratory (Exact CFT),"My proposal will explore non-perturbative aspects of conformal field theories (CFTs) with applications to both high energy and condensed matter systems. In condensed matter, CFTs describe quantum materials that are the target of current and future experiments. In high energy, CFTs provide the only known non-perturbative description of quantum gravity via the famous AdS/CFT duality. These CFTs are often strongly coupled, however, so they cannot be studied using standard perturbative tools such as Feynman diagrams. My plan is to combine cutting edge non-perturbative methods such as the conformal bootstrap, supersymmetric localization, and harmonic analysis to answer long standing questions in strongly coupled physics. This proposal is divided into two related strands:

Strand I. Non-perturbatively study quantum gravity via the dual CFT. For string and M-theory, the goals are to compute graviton scattering to all orders in the Planck length expansion, and study black hole states that appear in this scattering. For the simpler case of higher spin gravity, the goals are to extend my recent derivation of AdS/CFT, which applies to negative spacetime curvature, to the cosmologically relevant case of positive spacetime curvature, and to connect to string/M-theory AdS/CFT. The outputs of this strand will realize the dream of the holographic principle by computing exact physical observables in quantum gravity.

Strand II. Study quantum chromodynamics in 2+1 dimensions as an emergent description of algebraic spin liquids, deconfined criticality, and the transition between fractional quantum hall states. The goals are to determine when these theories are conformal, compute critical exponents, verify recently proposed dualities, and find new dualities. The outputs of this strand will predict physical observables that can guide ongoing and future experiments. Since these CFTs are dual to higher spin gravity, the output of strand I will also inform the research of strand II.",1638977,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
BSM-PM: New Atom Interferometry Techniques for Long Baseline Quantum Sensing in MAGIS,"Our understanding of the universe is in some respects highly mature, but in other ways just beginning to unfold. The Standard Model of particle physics has been tested to remarkable accuracy, and yet it can only explain a mere 15% of the matter in the universe. Discovering the nature of the remaining 85% of matter, called “dark matter” because it cannot be directly observed with light, is among the greatest challenges in science. One promising possibility is that dark matter consists of extremely light particles in such high abundance that they collectively act like invisible waves. This so-called ultralight wavelike dark matter is a natural prediction of many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, the recent observation of gravitational waves opens an entirely new modality for studying the universe. Just as it is essential to have many kinds of telescopes to cover different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, different instruments are needed to maximize our coverage of the gravitational wave spectrum. There is currently a need to fill the gap in the 0.05 Hz to 3 Hz “mid-band” frequency range between what is covered by laser interferometric detectors such as LIGO and the planned LISA spaceborne detector. The mid-band frequency range is promising for detecting gravitational waves produced during the earliest moments of the universe, and could also give astronomers early warning to enable the simultaneous observation of extreme events such as mergers of compact objects like neutron stars and black holes by both gravitational wave detectors and electromagnetic telescopes. To pursue these discovery opportunities, the PIs and collaborators are constructing MAGIS-100, a 100-meter-tall atom interferometer detector located at Fermilab. MAGIS-100 will search for wavelike dark matter and serve as a pathfinder instrument for a future gravitational wave detector. The team of PIs will develop novel techniques at the intersection of atomic physics and quantum information science that will allow MAGIS-100 and future detectors to reach their full scientific potential. This emerging research direction is at the nexus of four fields: particle physics, gravitational wave science, atomic physics, and quantum information science. In addition to mentoring graduate students and postdocs in the MAGIS-100 collaboration, to help them navigate this interdisciplinary research area, the PIs will organize an annual summer school to provide training for both beginning graduate students and more senior researchers in the broader community interested in expanding their expertise on quantum sensing for fundamental physics. Atom interferometers use laser pulses called “atom optics” to split, recombine, and interfere the quantum-mechanical wavefunctions of atoms. The sensitivity of atom interferometer detectors can be increased by using long measurement baselines, analogous to large laser interferometers like LIGO. However, to detect gravitational waves and perform broad searches for dark matter, the signal must additionally be coherently magnified by manipulating the quantum states of the atoms with sequences of thousands of laser pulses. This requires advances beyond current state-of-the-art atom interferometers, which are limited to hundreds of pulses by the accumulation of small errors in each pulse arising from experimental imperfections. To overcome this challenge, the PIs will leverage the framework of quantum control to develop a suite of atom optics techniques for long-baseline atom interferometry that are robust against these errors, addressing several different atom interferometer modalities required by the multi-faceted science goals of MAGIS-100. Long-baseline atom interferometry is a rapidly growing field, and beyond MAGIS these techniques can directly benefit other long-baseline atom interferometers under development around the world, including AION in the UK, MIGA in France, and ZAIGA in China. The team will also work to expand the MAGIS-100 science program by applying these techniques to new types of atoms and to atom interferometer configurations suitable for measurements of the fine structure constant, paving the way for the incorporation of these capabilities into MAGIS-100. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1629572,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Finding a second Earth through stellar understanding,"People, including me, have wondered for centuries if we are alone in the Universe. Only a mere thirty years ago, the first planet orbiting a star other than the Sun was discovered. These newly discovered worlds were called exoplanets. Over the last three decades we have witnessed an exponential rise in the number of known exoplanets, with more than 5000 discovered so far. This has shown that exoplanets are ubiquitous and come in various sizes and architectures. At the same time, a planet truly resembling Earth or a planetary system resembling the Solar System, has not yet been discovered.

My project will for the first time enable to find a planet resembling Earth orbiting a star resembling the Sun. Exoplanets can be detected by observing and modelling the gravitational wobble of their hosting star, seen in their changing radial velocities over time. Furthermore, the technique of using radial velocity changes is currently the only viable way of measuring the mass of small exoplanets. Unfortunately, for small long-period exoplanets such as Earth, these velocity changes are well below the stellar-induced changes in the radial velocity. These stellar signals are due to the surface variability of the stellar magnetic field and thus drown out the smaller signals from far-away exoplanets.

I will improve our ability to measure and extract the tiny signals of small exoplanets. This will be done by accounting for the stellar magnetic field variability in the spectroscopic data. I will use our brightest known star, the Sun, as a teststar to develop new techniques to deal with the stellar data. Removing the effect of the known planets in the Solar System, the Sun can act as the only known star where we are certain there are no planetary signals in the data. This creates a unique opportunity to test and improve new techniques before using them on other stars.

As a Future Leader Fellow, I will expand our instrumental capacities to study the Sun-as-a-star and characterise the small exoplanets found around other stars. As part of the project, I will build and exploit a new Solar Telescope to measure both stable radial velocities and the simultaneous changes in the Solar magnetic field. This unique instrument would be the first of its kind to have polarimetric capabilities that will open the pathway to discovering smaller and more distant exoplanets.

To place Earth and the Solar System into the context of the full exoplanet population, I will study the connection between stellar and planetary composition. I can do this using the same spectroscopic data used already in my project to find and characterise the exoplanets. By accurately characterising exoplanet systems as a whole, we will gain insight into the specific details of planet formation and evolution and the possibilities for existence of life on other planets. This will bring us one step closer to understanding our place in the Universe and how unique Earth could be.",1626709,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Towards an excellence centre on quantum photonics in Latvia,"The field of quantum technology is experiencing rapid development, with groundbreaking advancements. By establishing the Quantum Flagship initiative, the European Union has taken a proactive approach to quantum technologies. This initiative aims to explore and expand the frontiers of quantum technology. Quantum photonics plays a critical role within this framework. In light of this, our project seeks to chart a roadmap for the establishment of a Centre of Excellence of Quantum Photonics in Latvia. This endeavor holds significant importance as quantum photonics research remains underrepresented in Latvia and the other Baltic states, despite their untapped potential in materials synthesis and research. Notably, the Institute of Solid State Physics at the University of Latvia (ISSP UL) stands as one of the most esteemed institutes in the Baltic states, renowned for its expertise in studying optical properties of materials and conducting research on photonic elements. By leveraging the expertise of ISSP UL and fostering collaborations with scientific partners from Latvia and the Baltic states, we envision the creation of a European-level competitive quantum photonics centre centered around ISSP UL. Recognizing Latvia's latent potential in this field, it becomes imperative to develop a comprehensive roadmap for establishing such a centre of excellence. To achieve this ambitious goal and facilitate the transfer of knowledge about quantum photonics technologies, we have strategically chosen two esteemed Western Europe universities as our partners: the University of Trento and the University of Technology of Troyes. Both institutions boast a rich history of involvement in quantum photonics research and possess the necessary expertise to bridge the knowledge gaps at ISSP UL. Through the organization of conferences, schools, and workshops, our partners will lay the foundations for further research and inovation development at the institute.",1623728,2024,2027,European Commission,Latvia; Latvia; France; Italy,EU,Quantum Physics

Neutrino flavor Transformations in dense Astrophysical Environments,"This project NeuTrAE is aimed to advance our understanding on lingering puzzles on the flavor evolution of neutrinos and their implication in particle and nuclear astrophysics. Neutrinos are characterized by their flavors that can change as they propagate in a phenomenon known as neutrino flavor oscillations. The oscillations in vacuum and ordinary matter are well understood and confirmed by several experiments. Astrophysical compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae and the violent merger event of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, are profuse sources of neutrinos. In those astrophysical environments the neutrino flux becomes so intense that the flavor interference of neutrinos with each other has to be taken into account. This non-linear effect coupling neutrinos propagating in different directions and with different energies is known as collective neutrino oscillations. Accounting for the collective neutrino oscillations in simulations of astrophysical environments requires a quantum kinetic transport. It remains a tremendous challenge due to the high-dimensionality of the problem and the vastly different scales for flavor and hydrodynamical evolution. The impact of neutrino flavor transitions on those compact objects remains elusive without efficient and sophisticated treatments. I propose the project NeuTrAE providing a pipeline to study the impact of collective neutrino oscillations in astrophysical environments. It consists of three steps: performing neutrino quantum kinetic simulations, developing numerically effective schemes that can be incorporated in state-of-the art hydrodynamical simulations, and assessing the impact of neutrino flavor transformations on heavy element nucleosynthesis and its electromagnetic signatures. NeuTrAE will also commit to significant advance on dynamical evolution of astrophysical compact objects.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Taming Radiative heat Emission with Anisotropic and Time-varying media,"Thermal emission is a fundamental and ubiquitous process of energy and entropy transport, impacting science and engineering in various way. Yet, its stochastic nature, expressed in a broadband spectrum, lack of polarization and directionality, severely limits its control and manipulation.
TREAT aims at introducing a novel method for engineering the radiative heat transport and achieving unprecedented dynamical control over the spectrum and the momentum of thermal radiation. 
To achieve this goal, I propose to combine two classes of emergent materials: time-varying epsilon-near zero (ENZ) media and hyperbolic materials (HMs). The time modulation of ENZ media will allow to overcome the fundamental limits to thermal emission set by the Planck’s and Stefan-Boltzmann’s laws and achieve active control over its properties. While the HMs, will enable to extract and guide the intense thermal radiation confined at the emitter surface, i.e., in its near-field.
TREAT objectives address three intriguing questions: i) Can we create a time-varying media with ad hoc time modulation? ii) Can we manipulate thermal emission beyond the Planck’s law using the time-modulation? iii) Can we improve our control of the radiative heat flow in the near-field? Answering these questions requires the combination of expertise in nanophotonics and ultrafast science and perfectly suits my scientific profile. 
TREAT specifically targets the thermal emission engineering in the transparency window of Earth atmosphere, relevant for radiative cooling, and the development of novel coherent thermal sources in the THz range. TREAT will provide a fundamental advance to our understanding of thermal fields, beyond fluctuational electrodynamics, and a novel method for engineering the radiative heat flux, anticipating significant impacts in several applications of thermal light that would benefit from the active control of its properties, such as radiative cooling, energy harvesting, and optoelectronics.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Classical Physics
Living on the Edge: Unraveling Electron Correlations and Topological Transport in Quantum Spin Hall Insulators,"Q-EDGE aims to transform the landscape of energy-efficient electronics and quantum computing in response to pressing global energy and computational challenges. Central to this endeavor is the exploration of electron correlations and topological transport in Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) insulators. These are two-dimensional materials characterized by a bulk bandgap and topologically protected metallic edge states. Theoretical models hint at the potential of QSH edge states to facilitate charge transport without energy loss at room temperature and introduce unique quantum excitations in the form of Majorana fermions. Despite their potential, knowledge gaps and experimental challenges hinder harnessing their properties. These include material constraints, such as small bandgaps limiting investigations to extremely low temperatures, and technique limitations obstructing precise edge state measurements.
My discovery that germanene, the germanium analog of graphene, is a QSH insulator with a sizable bandgap, combined with my advancements in scanning probe microscopies, equips me to solve these challenges and fulfill my objectives: 
(1) To uncover the principles underpinning charge and spin transport in QSH insulators.
(2) To identify the quantum mechanisms causing deviations from ideal, dissipationless transport.
(3) To engineer the QSH edge states to manifest elusive Majorana fermions.
Q-EDGE aspires to set new standards in topological research, promoting germanene as a benchmark material and developing methodologies applicable to diverse quantum systems. This initiative will significantly inform and refine contemporary theories of complex quantum phases of matter. The urgency is high since the exploration of this realm has just begun, its promises have not yet been materialized, and the extent of its potential for new physics remains largely untapped. As we stand on the cusp of quantum innovations, Q-EDGE will turn theoretical potentials into tangible breakthroughs.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
quantum-enhanced shadows: scalable quantum-to-classical converters,"Large-scale quantum experiments do not work in isolation. Substantial classical computing power is required to control the experiment and process the results. This necessarily creates information-transmission bottlenecks at the interface between quantum and classical realms. These bottlenecks create scalability issues that prevent us from using existing architectures to the best of their capabilities and may even impair our ability to further scale up system sizes.

In this project, we adopt a unifying framework that takes into account all computing resources (quantum and classical). We develop quantum-to-classical converters to overcome information-transmission bottlenecks. Dubbed shadows, they leverage randomization, as well as quantum-enhanced readout strategies to obtain a succinct classical description of an underlying quantum system that can then be used to efficiently predict many features at once. The shadow paradigm is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and utilizes genuine quantum effects that do not have a classical counterpart. Building on these ideas, we also establish rigorous synergies between quantum experiments and classical machine learning. Shadow learning protocols use shadows to succinctly represent training data obtained from actual quantum experiments. A classical training stage then enables data-driven learning of genuine quantum phenomena. Finally, we develop new tools to ensure reliable execution on current quantum hardware, thus bridging the gap between theory and experiment.

My interdisciplinary skill set combines methods from modern computer science with quantum information and has already led to numerous high-impact contributions (e.g. 1 Nature Physics with more than 350 citations and 2 Science publications). These insights form the basis for this larger project, where we lay the foundation for scalable and practical quantum data processing and learning that can keep up and grow with future improvements in quantum technology.",1623724,2024,2029,ERC,Austria,EU,Quantum Physics
Force-free microstructures host intrinsic dynamics of orbital phases in AV3Sb5 Kagome metals,"Electron correlations significantly modify electron self-organization in quantum materials, resulting in a landscape of competing orders and exotic quantum phenomena. The recently discovered AV3Sb5 family Kagome superconductors is an intriguing example of competing correlated orders with robust entanglement, as manipulating one order can affect or modify another, akin to the unique electromagnetic responses of multi-ferroics. These strongly entangled orders have led to an exciting hypothesis of orbital loop current, a prime example of correlation-driven electronic instabilities. Nevertheless, it renders the inherent characteristics practically inaccessible through conventional means, as even slight variations in experimental conditions can significantly affect their physical properties. 

Our research plan is to examine the novel electronic response of the hypothesized orbital loop current in AV3Sb5. We will research the intrinsic dynamics of orbital phases and their unique electronic response via 1) atomically engineering the Kagome nets with the comprehensive material database serves as the Kagome toolbox, 2) heat/electric quenching of charge order for effectively tuning the interlayer coupling in a Kagome glass state, 3) spatial control of chiral domains with optical polarization, representing three unambiguous routes for revealing the intrinsic electronic orders in AV3Sb5.

These goals are ambitious yet entirely realizable: Free-Kagome’s research approach is based on a unique force-free setup that features controllable mechanical and thermal coupling between the focused-ion-beam (FIB) fabricated microstructure and its supporting frame based on the extremely soft membrane springs with designed geometry.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Quantum Physics
Magnetic counterparts of unconventional superconductors for spin-conserved and non-dissipative electronics,"Our recent discovery of altermagnets has opened science and technology opportunities unparalleled in the two conventional classes of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Moreover, the direct analogy of a d-wave spin-polarization order in altermagnets to the unconventional d-wave superconducting order in cuprates suggests that we now hold a key to a vast uncharted territory of unconventional magnetism. In my project, I will identify unconventional forms of magnetism beyond the d-wave cuprate counterparts, including such prominent examples as magnetic counterparts of s$^\pm$-wave pnictide superconductors or p-wave superfluid He-3. To build a “periodic table” of unconventional even and odd-parity wave magnets, I will develop a generalized symmetry-based methodology, tailored to a variable hierarchy of interactions across this large materials' territory. With the “periodic table” of unconventional magnetism, I will remove fundamental roadblocks in research and applications of relativistic and topological phases based on conventional magnets: the non-conserved spin of relativistic electrons, and the fragility of topological phases with non-dissipative electronic transport. I will demonstrate: (i) Even-parity-wave magnetism with time-reversal-symmetry breaking in the electronic structure accompanied by a vanishing net magnetization, and with conserved spin of relativistic electrons. (ii) Odd-parity-wave magnetism with time-reversal-invariant electronic structure, and with a strong exchange spin-splitting counterpart of the conventional weak relativistic spin splitting. (iii) Robust synergy of unconventional magnetism with topological phases in one common crystal. Armed with (i-iii), I will show the path to spin-conserved and non-dissipative electronic transport at ambient conditions using the unconventional magnets. This can pave the way for future ultra temporally and spatially scalable and energy-efficient spin-based electronics.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
de Sitter Space Holography and Quantum Information,"New approaches to de Sitter (dS) space holography open a promising avenue for quantum gravity in dS space. Simultaneously, newly developed quantum information tools allow us to study those proposals and their properties. It is the objective of this project to study holography in dS space using quantum information tools.

I would like to use quantum information to find an alternative description of dS space in terms of an exact quantum mechanical model. For this, I will explore different recent approaches to dS space holography including the idea of defining a holographic theory on the stretched cosmological horizon and the use of holographic flow geometries. I will use novel measures from the world of quantum information – entanglement, complexity, out of time ordered correlation functions, chaos and thermalization and compare their behavior to numerical results for possible candidates of a quantum mechanical dual theory. This detailed study will allow me to identify a precise quantum mechanical dual for dS space.

The project will have a major impact on the way we understand quantum gravity in dS space, bringing holography from the theoretical realm where gravity lives in a box to a real-world applicable scenario. It is further expected that extending holographic quantum information beyond anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to a larger class of theories will draw new and important lessons for quantum information and quantum computation.

It is the perfect time to conduct this line of research. While dS space holography has been a long-time endeavour in theoretical physics, progress in low-dimensional holography and quantum information makes it now possible to address it from a novel and concrete point of view. I have been a pioneer in applying quantum information tools in AdS space and have worked on the new approaches to dS holography. I therefore believe that I am the right person to carry out this promising line of research.",1623724,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
TIME-Varying Nanophotonics for New Regimes of QED LIGHT-Matter Interactions,"Controlling light and its interaction with matter at the nanoscale is one of the major aims of current Science with applications ranging from energy-efficient photonic-based communications, quantum information processing, or high precision sensors. Owing to the hybrid light-matter modes supported by nanophotonic structures, from THz and IR polaritons in 2D materials to optical plasmonic resonances, nanophotonics offers an ideal platform for an exquisite control of light-matter interactions even at room temperature. Light concentrated at the nanoscale is a natural playground for quantum electro-dynamical (QED) processes, whereby light-matter interactions reveal their quantum nature. 
However, conventional approaches to nanophotonics-based QED are limited by two fundamental principles: energy conservation and reciprocity. Overcoming these limitations would enable non-photon conserving devices and one-way channels, opening the door to a compact route to quantum photonic circuits. TIMELIGHT proposes the use of time-modulated media, whose optical parameters (e.g., permittivity) are dynamically modulated by an external actuation, to realise fundamentally new non-Hermitian and non-reciprocal QED effects. This theoretical project roots in recent experimental advances that have shown unprecedentedly large and fast modulations of nanophotonic structures.  
TIMELIGHT will deliver advances in the following areas: (1) tuning of spontaneous emission and collective interactions of quantum emitters, (2) new forms of free electron radiation, (3) novel mechanisms for enhancing spontaneous photon generation, and (4) synthetic-motion based fluctuation-induced forces. TIMELIGHT will open the door to time-varying nanophotonics as a new paradigm to tailoring light-matter interactions at room temperature with non-Hermitian and non-reciprocal effects. This will shed light in the understanding of fundamental QED processes and ultimately be of interest to quantum photonic technologies.",1623724,2024,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Advanced Structure Preserving Lagrangian schemes for novel first order Hyperbolic Models: towards General Relativistic Astrophysics,"ALcHyMiA will make substantial progress in applied mathematics, targeting long-time stable and self-consistent simulations in general relativity and high energy density problems, via the development of new and effective structure preserving numerical methods with provable mathematical properties. We will devise innovative schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) which at the discrete level exactly preserve all the invariants of the continuous problem, such as equilibria, involutions and asymptotic limits. Next to fluids and magnetohydrodynamics, key for benchmarks and valuable applications on Earth, we target a new class of first order hyperbolic systems that unifies fluid and solid mechanics and gravity theory. This allows to study gravitational waves, binary neutron stars and accretion disks around black holes that require the coupled evolution of matter and spacetime. Here, high resolution and minimal dissipation at shocks and moving interfaces are crucial and will be achieved by groundbreaking direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods on moving Voronoi meshes with changing topology. These are necessary to maintain optimal grid quality even when following rotating compact objects, complex shear flows or metric torsion. They also ensure rotational invariance, entropy stability and Galilean invariance in the Newtonian limit. The breakthrough of our new Finite Volume and Discontinuous Galerkin ALE schemes lies in the geometrical understanding and high order PDE integration over 4D spacetime manifolds. The high-risk high-gain challenge is the design of smart DG schemes with virtual, bound-preserving, genuinely nonlinear data-dependent function spaces, taking advantage of the Voronoi properties. Finally, it is an explicit mission of ALcHyMiA to grow a solid scientific community, sharing know-how by tailored dissemination activities from top-level schools to carefully organized international events revolving around personalized interactions.",1623724,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Massive-binary EvoluTion Across the metallicity Ladder,"Do massive stars undergo supernova explosions when collapsing into black holes? What mechanisms drove the Cosmos into an epoch of reionization? How was dust produced in the Early Universe? Scarcely any field of astronomy remains unaffected by massive stars: stars born with more than eight solar masses. Yet, studies in the Local Universe reveal substantial gaps in our understanding of massive stars related to mass loss, internal mixing, core-collapse, and stellar interactions. Uncertainties worsen at the low-metallicity conditions of the Early Universe. The primary reason for this: a severe lack of empirical constraints on massive binaries across the metallicity axis, driven by the rarity of massive stars and the shortage of adequate monitoring campaigns to study them.
METAL leverages hundreds of hours worth of novel spectroscopic and interferometric data collected as PI using observatories such as the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Hubble Space Telescope, including a VLT Large Programme (116hr; 2023 - 2025). These campaigns monitor thousands of massive stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.  Targeting unevolved OB-type stars, evolved Wolf-Rayet and Oe/Be stars, and elusive black holes, METAL will elucidate the initial conditions, evolution, and ultimate fates of massive stars at three metallicity anchors. Groundbreaking outcomes include (1) unprecedented statistics on the multiplicity, initial mass function, and structure of massive stars at low metallicity, (2) a tenfold increase in the sample of dormant black-hole binaries and the first such sample at low metallicity, and (3) a revised mass-loss prescription and a comprehensive binary characterisation of evolved massive stars at two metallicity anchors. The deliverables will be the defining calibrators for next-generation evolution models of massive stars, ushering in advancements in models of not only stellar evolution, but galaxy evolution, unresolved stellar populations, and core-collapse supernova.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Harnessing Localized Charges for Advancing Polar Materials Engineering,"Semiconductor functionality hinges on the behaviour of excess charges, especially electrons and holes, crucial for storing, transporting, and converting energy. In certain semiconductors, charges can localize within lattice distortions, forming polarons or self-trapped excitons. While these entities alter material traits, there remains a gap in understanding their nature, especially in complex inorganic and organometallic materials, and methods for their reliable control and identification are lacking.

POLARISE aims to bridge approaches from materials engineering, computational materials science and condensed matter theory, seeking to attain comprehensive insights into the consequences of charge localization. It will develop holistic models that elucidate the interplay of effects that charge localization can have on various material properties, leveraging machine learning methods to study charge localization at varying temperatures, and identifying experimental signatures for their reliable detection.

By achieving these objectives, POLARISE will revolutionize our fundamental understanding and control of charge localization within complex materials. This breakthrough promises to not only advance material science but also unlock novel opportunities across various other fields. It will significantly contribute to improving semiconductor technologies, such as solar or photoelectrocatalytic cells, and enable precise identification of localized charges in experimental settings, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technological possibilities.",1623724,2025,2029,ERC,Sweden,EU,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Condensed Matter Physics
A New Paradigm for High-Precision Top Mass and Jet Substructure Measurements at the LHC,"We are in the era of precision collider physics where a major challenge is to accurately describe the effects of the strong interactions. The precise determination of the top quark mass is one of the most important measurements in particle physics: it is crucial for indirect searches for new physics and the analysis of the stability of the universe. Currently, the measurement is plagued by theoretical imprecision, including an over-reliance on Monte Carlo simulations and the lack of a systematically improvable treatment of the physics of hadronization (the process by which quarks and gluons are bound into color-neutral hadrons). The same limitations also impact essentially all jet substructure measurements. This includes measurements of the strong coupling, which is another fundamental parameter of the Standard Model. With the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the horizon, addressing these problems becomes exceptionally timely and critical.

TOPMASS will overcome these problems by 1) capitalizing on the PI's recent groundbreaking work to exploit Energy-Energy Correlators as a top mass-sensitive probe leading to a new paradigm, and 2) exploiting modern effective field theory methods for developing a model-independent framework to describe hadronization, enabling precise jet substructure determination of the top mass and the strong coupling. This avoids the systematic uncertainty from the usage of hadronization models. It will have immediate applicability to a wide range of precision QCD measurements.

The key outcomes of TOPMASS will be
1)  High-precision computations that enable a sub-GeV top mass measurement at the LHC in a field-theoretic scheme.
2)  A systematic data-driven approach for describing hadronization effects in modern jet substructure observables.",1623722,2025,2030,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Realizing non-abelian anyons in van der Waals materials,"Demonstrating non-abelian exchange statistics holds the promise of leading science to new terrains where we can manipulate exotic quasiparticles. Unlike fermions, bosons, and abelian anyons, the many-body wavefunction of indistinguishable non-abelian anyons is entirely altered when swapping their positions. With the theoretical groundwork for uncovering exotic exchange properties, pioneering experiments provided preliminary evidence of the lowest-order non-abelian anyons, indicating the topological superconductivity phase. Yet, due to technological limitations inherent to current state-of-the-art platforms, new observations of non-abelian statistics or preliminary signatures of higher-order non-abelian anyons must be offered.
In this proposal, I aim to directly observe the exchange statistics of non-abelian anyons, overcoming present technological challenges by incorporating proven intricate designs to innovative van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures.
We will study spatial-domain and time-domain braiding of non-abelian anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime, realized in high-mobility graphene-based heterostructures. We will perform spatial-domain QH-interferometry (Obj. 1), allowing the study of coherence and braiding of anyons; and study their exchange statistics in the time-domain via cross-correlation of current-fluctuations of partitioned anyons (Obj. 2). Higher-order non-abelian anyons will be sought after via fractional Andreev Reflection (AR) in FQHE-superconductor (SC) hybrids. Employing shot noise measurements will allow identifying the AR charge quanta (Obj. 3), while low-disorder vdW-SC interfaces necessitate an in-situ stacking and integration of pre-patterned vdW-SC layers.
This research will identify phases hosting non-abelian anyons and thus lay the groundwork for their detection and manipulation. This contribution, being fundamental in its core, may also offer a practical option for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.",1623722,2024,2029,ERC,Israel,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Astro Dark Large & Small,"The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a successful, extremely well-verified theory. Nevertheless, the SMappears far from being complete. There are still many theoretical and experimental open questions: the strong-CP problem, the origin of neutrino masses, the nature of dark energy and dark matter. The need for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is undeniable, but the question The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a successful, extremely well-verified theory. Nevertheless, the SM appears far from being complete. There are still many theoretical and experimental open questions: the strong-CP problem, the origin of neutrino masses, the nature of dark energy and dark matter. The need for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is undeniable, but the question is: how and where will we find it?  The aim of the AstroDarkLS project is to try to discover or falsify important theoretical models of light particles, such as axions and dark photons, considering their impact in astrophysical and cosmological systems which were never considered in depth by the particle physics community. The project is organised around three main themes, spanning various length scales in the universe: the use of stars and astrophysical objects to look for new physics; the impact of motivated BSM models on star formation; the investigation of electromagnetic signals both from galaxies and the interstellar medium between them. For each theme groundbreaking objectives are identified, such as the first simulation of Supernovae radiative transport including axions, the first public code for star formation in the presence of light physics, the innovative use of line intensity mapping (LIM) to detect dark matter decay or annihilation into photons. All the objectives are located at the interface between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology, building on the unique experience of the PI in these various disciplines and in perfect alignment with the European Commission vision.",1623722,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Coherent Steering of Order via Lattice Resonances,"Discovering methods that facilitate ultrafast and minimally-dissipative switching of spontaneous ordering represents one of the most prominent research directions in modern condensed matter physics. In recent years, breakthrough experiments have revealed that circularly-polarized femtosecond pulses, in the visible spectral range, can non-thermally perturb magnetization via the ultrafast inverse Faraday effect. However, the associated pathway of energy flow – from light to electrons to spins - incurs substantial parasitic energy losses while simultaneously restricting the functional duration and amplitude of the spin stimulus to the highly-limited lifetime and strength of the photo-excited electrons. Aiming to unveil an alternative and potentially superior method for the selective switching of magnetic order, this project will explore the possibility of manipulating and ultimately reversing magnetization using left- or right-handed circularly-polarized optical phonons driven at resonance. To coherently pump such phonons, this project will exploit the intense and narrow-band infrared light pulses delivered by free-electron lasers. The ensuing rotational motion of ions, in a manner analogous to the ultrafast Barnett effect, is predicted to temporarily create a magnetic moment that could be sufficiently strong enough, by virtue of the longer lifetime and non-linear character of optical phonons, to drive large-amplitude permanent reorientation of magnetization. By constructing state-of-the-art multi-color pump-probe techniques, operational in both stroboscopic and single-shot modes, the existence, character and universality of this never-seen-before source for magnetic recording and processing of data will be discovered. While the challenging and high-risk experiments proposed here explore largely-uncharted physics, they could reveal a disruptive new tool that enables the highly-efficient, ultrafast and directional switching of spontaneous order.",1623713,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Quantum Vortex Simulator: from fundamental properties toward engineering mobility,"Vortices lie at the heart of classical fluid dynamics in both nature and technology. Likewise, vortices play an essential role in quantum fluids and solids, determining their fundamental transport properties. This project will explore both fundamental and practical aspects of quantum vortices at a new level using the platform of quantum gases, expanding the horizons of vortex research. It aims at experimentally addressing intractable vortex problems by taking the best advantage of the latest quantum technologies and the favorable time and length scales of vortex dynamics in ultracold atomic superfluids. First, I will explore both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) vortex dynamics in a homogeneous box potential, with an emphasis on the universal characteristics of vortex dynamics on macroscopic length scales. Changing the vortex length inside a uniform trap will allow us to cross freely from 2D to 3D vortex physics. Second, I will study vortex dynamics in sophisticatedly tailored pinning landscapes. The unprecedented controllability of these arbitrary pinning potentials and vortex configurations will enable us to shed new light on many elementary aspects of vortex dynamics, paving the way for engineering vortex mobility and thus directly impacting superconductor research.",1623713,2024,2028,ERC,Italy,EU,"Engineering; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
TREASURES: Digging into dwarf galaxies,"The Milky Way is an environment rich with satellite galaxies, stellar streams and accreted systems. Encoded in these structures is the formation and evolution of the Galaxy through cosmic time. Fortunately, these nearby relics can be studied in extraordinary detail – star by star – revealing the properties of the first stars, the build-up of chemical elements in the Universe, the nature of dark matter, and hierarchical galaxy formation.
To unlock these treasure troves of hidden information, I designed a large-scale survey: 4DWARFS (PI: Skúladóttir, 520,000 fibre hours) that after a very competitive 2-year selection has now been accepted as a 5-year 4MOST survey, starting in 2024. 4DWARFS will collect high-quality spectra of individual stars in close to 50 dwarf galaxies, and dozens of stellar streams from systems currently undergoing disruption.
The goal of TREASURES is to execute and exploit this large 4DWARFS survey to its highest scientific potential. TREASURES will provide the community with stellar ages, radial velocities and chemical abundances for over 130,000 stars, and thus increase the number of stars with detailed abundance information in dwarf galaxies and streams by several orders of magnitude, ensuring the far-reaching impact of this project. Furthermore, TREASURES will use state-of-the-art models to contrast these new large data against theory, and put in context with the Milky Way.  
Through an ambitious combination of modelling and data of unprecedented magnitude and completeness TREASURES will quantify and put fundamental constraints on:
(I) The properties of the first stars (mass and energy distributions)
(II) The origin of the chemical elements (physics of stars, supernovae and neutron star mergers)
(III) Hierarchical galaxy formation at the smallest mass scales, and structure of dark matter halos
TREASURES will thus paint a comprehensive picture of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way environment, from cosmic dawn until the present day.",1623713,2024,2028,ERC,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Three Dimensional Quantum Nanomaterials,"Quantum nanomaterials are highly relevant for today’s society, playing a key role in existing technologies, and promising revolutionary changes addressing global issues, with the possibility for new computing architectures, and highly efficient devices.
Until now, most studies of quantum nanomaterials have been two dimensional. Extending to three dimensions results in opportunities for increased density and interconnectivity, with the possibility to go beyond the physics of planar systems. This has recently been exemplified by nanomagnetism, where advances in methodologies have driven breakthroughs in our physical understanding, leading to the discovery of exotic spin textures, non-reciprocal dynamics and curvature-induced effects. However, the extension of a wider range of quantum nanomaterials to 3D geometries faces experimental challenges.
In this ERC project I propose to explore the physics of quantum nanomaterials in three dimensions, developing state-of-the-art experimental techniques, establishing a common experimental methodology, to study the fundamental physics of 3D quantum nanomaterials. 
This project will address three scientific cases. First, I will develop 3D antiferromagnetic imaging to explore the formation of topological textures in antiferromagnets, and their current-induced dynamics. Second, I will measure the dynamics of 3D nanomagnets, realising non-reciprocal domain wall motion and spin waves in a low-symmetry 3D geometry. Third, I will harness new nanofabrication capabilities to explore the physics of 3D superconducting nanocircuits, achieving local control of the state, as well as exploring the behaviour of superconducting vortices.
This project will lead to advances both in experimental capabilities, and in our understanding of the influence of 3D nanogeometries on the physics of quantum materials. The project will facilitate a change of paradigm for quantum nanomaterials, impacting both fundamental research and technological applications.",1623713,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Quantum Physics
On-chip energy harvesting and management enabled by Thermal engineering of two-dimensional MAterials,"Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals layered materials have been acclaimed for their great potential in several fields of condensed matter physics. As applications are starting to appear, increased effort is dedicated to understand their unique electronic, optical, mechanical and chemical properties. However, thermal and thermoelectric (TE) properties of 2D materials remain largely underexplored despite their profound potential impact on one of the most important current scientific and technological challenges: energy management. 

TheMA is an ambitious project, which aims to create a breakthrough in our understanding and ability to control phonon and energy transport at the nanoscale. Its main goal is to create novel 2D semiconductor nanomaterials and heterostructures for thermal management applications and TE devices for power generation beyond current state-of-the-art. Specifically, by using phonon engineering approaches supported by advanced characterization, the project targets the fabrication and on-chip integration of (a) novel engineered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) based nanostructures for heat guiding and superior thermal insulation and (b) TE power generators capable of recycling the waste heat from hot spots or environmental interlinks, to deliver sufficient power to sustain low-power electronics. Ultimate goal of the project is to provide innovative solutions for on-chip energy management and energy harvesting for Information and Communication Technologies, the Internet of Things and 2D nanoelectronic devices.

The research proposed here will go beyond state-of-the-art providing the in-depth understanding of nanoscale energy dissipation and phonon transport in 2D nanomaterials and lay the foundations for the development of future three-dimensional heterogeneous electronics. The findings will drastically enhance the prospects of TMD materials for thermal management and TE applications and boost their integration in the main semiconductor industry.",1623712,2024,2029,ERC,Greece; United Kingdom,EU,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics
Imaging the local flow of heat and phonons,"Efficient heat management is of paramount importance for modern-day electronics to ensure optimal performance and energy consumption. While Fourier's two-century-old macroscopic model for heat diffusion has served as a valuable tool, in particular for homogeneous solids at room temperature, it does not hold on short time and length scales. Notably, the model assumes that an abrupt and localized temperature perturbation propagates instantly everywhere in the rest of the material.

This project aims to visualize the breakdown of the Fourier's law, paving the way for the development of a more physically satisfying model of heat propagation. My investigation will focus on a specific and very illustrative non-Fourier transport regime that has recently attracted considerable interest in the scientific community: the viscous hydrodynamic regime. To achieve this, I will design and construct a highly sensitive, and spatially resolved thermometer, capable of probing material surfaces with an exceptional resolution to resolve heat propagation at the nanoscale. This tool is a SQUID-on-tip (SOT). 

I will carefully scan materials known to exhibit this phenomenon at different scales and play with geometries to enhance or attenuate its effects. By comparing the temperature maps obtained in these regimes with predictions from recent theoretical propositions, I will directly test these models. This project will illuminate the underlying microscopic mechanisms responsible for heat transport, offering crucial insights into the intricate nature of heat propagation in materials at the nanoscale.

THERMOSCOPY represents a groundbreaking initiative that will serve as a stepping stone towards the formulation of a comprehensive physical model for heat propagation in solids beyond the Fourier equation. This will impact the design of future more energy efficient materials.",1623710,2025,2030,ERC,France,EU,Engineering; Classical Physics
Cosmic Inflation and Structure Formation Through Global Analysis,"During the last decades, high-precision experiments have made increasingly detailed measurements of
diffuse Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) emitted by cosmological sources. This has revolutionized
the understanding of our cosmic origins. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is our most precious
resource for understanding the Big Bang, while the Cosmic Infrared and Optical Backgrounds (CIB and
COB) provide unique constraints on the evolution of large scale structure from the first galaxies to
today. Until recently, measurements of these effects were limited by either foregrounds or instrumental
noise. However, the combined signal-to-noise ratio has now grown so large that the interplay between
astrophysical confusion and instrumental systematic uncertainties dominate the error budget. To make
further process, it has become critical to account for all sources of uncertainties simultaneously. In the
Origins project, I will solve this challenge through joint integrated end-to-end analysis of multiple state-
of-the-art experiments to construct a single coherent model of all main diffuse astrophysical emission
processes from 1 um to 23 GHz. In a novel approach, Origins will utilize archival observations from
ACT, AKARI, COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRAS, Planck, and WMAP, many in the form of raw time-
ordered data, with upcoming measurements from Simons Observatory and SPHEREx. This will result in
the world’s strongest and most robust constraints on primordial inflationary gravitational waves; the most
accurate map of CIB fluctuations published to date; and possibly the world’s first map of large-scale COB
fluctuations. Simultaneously, it will redefine our understanding of thermal dust emission in the Milky
Way spanning a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and will improve the precision of current
models of Zodiacal Light by several orders of magnitude. This Open Science project will define a new
paradigm for next-generation CMB B-mode and EBL experiments.",1623704,2025,2029,ERC,Norway,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Excitonic 2D Metasurfaces for Active Multifunctional Flat Optics,"Can light fields be manipulated by a single atomic layer? Can quantum mechanical effects in monolayer materials be harnessed to realize dynamic optical elements? Recent work has demonstrated that light-weight and ultra-thin nanostructured optical coatings (metasurfaces) can perform the same optical functions as conventional bulky optical components. Despite these advances, metasurface optical elements have remained static. At the same time, newly emerging and future applications require optical elements with dynamic control of their functionality.

Here, I propose to lay the foundations of a completely new class of tunable and multifunctional optical elements by combining recent developments in 2D material science, quantum physics, and nanophotonics, resulting in highly novel excitonic 2D metasurfaces. 

Building on my strong expertise in the fields of optical metasurfaces and 2D material physics, I will employ monolayer 2D quantum materials to actively tune the optical response of novel nonlocal metasurfaces. These atomically-thin materials exhibit a strong quantum-mechanical exciton resonance in the visible spectral range, even at room temperature. 

Using electrical control over this exciton resonance, I will study the interplay of localized excitons and delocalized optical modes. Next, I will realize ultracompact optical elements with electrically-tunable functionality. Finally, I will develop novel methods to combine stacked metasurfaces in compound meta-optics that offer multifunctional dynamic optical components.

The excitonic 2D metasurfaces open new routes to study the unconventional properties of quantum materials in quantum optics, nanophotonics, and solid-state physics. At the same time, the results of this project open an entirely new approach for the design of actively-tunable multifunctional flat optical components with applications in optical communication, augmented reality, and computational imaging.",1623693,2024,2028,ERC,Netherlands,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"

Studying a diverse range of exoplanets is critical for investigating Earth-like exoplanets in the long-term as we develop the tools, facilities and techniques necessary for understanding their atmospheres in detail. Advanced telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and 30-metre telescopes (e.g. the Extremely Large Telescope, ELT; first-light ~2028) will enable direct exoplanet studies, but interpretation of these results will hinge on a thorough understanding of their complex weather phenomena. Exo-PEA is a transformational program that will utilise a novel combination of observational and computational data-driven techniques to reveal the physics of three critical weather phenomena in giant extrasolar worlds: clouds, winds and aurorae.

My team will perform the first spatially-resolved investigations of clouds in extrasolar worlds, revealing the longitudinal and latitudinal behaviour of clouds.

Connecting Random Conformal Geometry and Teichmüller theory,"Random conformal geometry deals with the analysis of conformally invariant systems using probabilistic methods. Random geometric objects, such as the random fractal SLE curves, arise from statistical mechanics models and are of central interest in modern probability theory and mathematical physics. Teichmüller theory as originally introduced studies complex structures on a surface. Teichmüller spaces carry a rich geometric structure and have been an important research topic since the mid-twentieth century. These two fields are traditionally far apart. However, via the introduction of the Loewner energy, the PI showed surprisingly that SLE is closely related to Weil-Petersson Teichmüller space and made the first contact between SLE theory and Teichmüller theory.  Further developments exploring the link and recent progress in probabilistic Liouville conformal field theory also suggest that the connection between the two areas is stronger than currently known and we believe exploring the connection is of major scientific interest.     

The ambition of this project is to break new ground in establishing links between fundamental concepts in random conformal geometry and Teichmüller theory by combining in a pioneering way techniques from probability, complex analysis, geometric analysis, Kähler geometry, spectral theory, and representation theory. We focus on three objectives:
      1. Advance the understanding of the deep reason behind the link between SLE and the Kähler geometry of Weil-Petersson universal Teichmüller space.
      2.  Establish the link between Liouville actions and projective structures in a systematic way.
      3.  Identify the holography of Loewner energy and explore the uncharted territory of holographic principles of random conformal geometry.

The feasibility of each component of both space and ground segments are assessed by dedicated studies. These studies allow to identify the critical technologies and components necessary to deploy the mission. The way forward for technological maturation is proposed in order to ensure the deployment of the Quantum Space Gravimetry Pathfinder Mission within the decade. The Preliminary Requirement Review formally concludes CARIOQA-PHA by assessing the project readiness and technology maturity to enter into Phase B.

Effects of Spin-orbit Coupling on Superconducting Pairing Interactions,"Superconductors with spin-orbit coupling exhibit many fascinating properties, including abnormally high upper critical fields and possible topological excitations. These effects are recognized as originating from the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the Cooper pair wave function. In contrast, how spin-orbit coupling affects the superconducting pairing interactions – the glue that binds electrons together in Cooper pairs – remains an open question. This is particularly relevant in unconventional superconductors as the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electronically mediated superconducting pairing interactions may give rise to novel feedback effects that boost the efficacy of the pairing interactions.

In this project, I will adopt a dual-pronged approach to study the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and interactions: (1) Develop a generalized Eliashberg theory to account for feedback effects in spin-orbit coupled systems and (2) implement fermionic renormalization group methods and determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations to map out the interplay between electronic correlations and spin-orbit coupling.

The main results of SuperSOC will be:
- Establishing how spin-orbit coupling may fundamentally reshape the pairing interactions and modify the associated superconducting instabilities of unconventional superconductors.
- Developing a framework for studying these feedback effects in material-specific models and employing this to understand the phase diagrams of unconventional spin-orbit coupled superconductors.
- Demonstrating how the interplay between electronic correlations and spin-orbit coupling leads to anisotropic interactions that alter the shape of the electronic phase diagram and may enhance pairing.

These achievements pave the way for identifying the nature and origin of unconventional superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled systems and enable a determination of the electronic phase diagrams in such systems.",1623600,2024,2029,ERC,Denmark,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Volatile dynamics and regolith interactions  on solar system bodies,"Over the recent decades, several remote observations have provided evidence for water on the Moon. Due to the lack of in-situ measurements, the nature of lunar water is not yet sufficiently understood. Open fundamental questions include the origin and form, spatial distribution, temporal variation, transport processes, and surface interactions. In VOLARIS, I will employ a novel modelling and experimental approach to address these questions and characterise their main influencing factors. I will specifically study the combined physical, chemical, and thermal processes across the exosphere, surface, and subsurface that govern the dynamic behaviour of volatile water. These investigations will be similarly relevant to other species such as hydrogen, hydroxyl, and noble gases and will significantly advance our understanding of the volatile dynamics of many atmosphere-less celestial bodies. 
Current models are not capable of simulating the complete volatile cycle with the respective source, sink, loss, conversion, and transport processes, mainly due to the computational complexity and the different physical scales. I will develop a unified model framework to enable more comprehensive simulations across different model domains and scales to systematically investigate the sensitivities to key parameters. With a novel experimental setup, I will reproduce coupled processes of the lunar water cycle in an analogue environment to investigate volatile transport and interactions emerging from a combination of multiple factors. These include complex formation and release processes and temperature-driven migration and redeposition of volatiles. VOLARIS will enable ground-breaking research on the volatile dynamics of atmosphere-less celestial bodies and is highly relevant to fundamental solar system science, future missions and instrument developments, the preservation of volatiles in their natural environment, as well as the potential utilisation of volatile resources.",1623554,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Earth Sciences; Space Sciences
Unleashing the predictive power of tidal disruption events,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been known for decades as unique probes of otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes and their environment, in a mass range inaccessible by any other techniques. However, fulfilling this potential has so far been hindered by a crucial lack of understanding of the physics causing the emission. My program will solve this theoretical bottleneck and unleash the predictive power of TDEs at the dawn of an observational golden era provided by the Rubin Observatory.

A TDE occurs when a star is disrupted by a black hole, after which the stellar debris fuels the compact object, generating the detectable signal. While characterizing this emission has been prevented by the impossibility of simulating the entire gas evolution, I am pioneering a new computational approach that solves this long-standing impediment by dividing the evolution into interconnected phases. Relying on this technique, I will deliver the first paradigm for the TDE emission based on first-principles simulations.

Using this new knowledge, I will build theoretical lightcurves that directly depend on astrophysical system parameters, namely the black hole and stellar properties, and develop the first physically sound analysis toolkit for detected TDEs, which statistically compares these lightcurves to observed ones to infer system parameters. Applying this toolkit to the wealth of upcoming TDE detections, I will shed new light on some of the most pressing mysteries in astrophysics, including the formation and growth of supermassive black holes, the properties and interactions between the stars orbiting them, and the processes leading to relativistic jets and neutrino production.

My ambitious research program is designed to capitalize on the observational revolution brought about by the Rubin Observatory, setting the foundations for TDE science in the decade to come with far-reaching implications across fields from galaxy evolution to high-energy astrophysics.",1623554,2024,2029,ERC,United Kingdom,EU,Astronomical Sciences
"Entanglement Theory: a Quantum Odyssey, from the Generalised Quantum Stein's Lemma to Quantum Gravity","Quantum entanglement fuels the most important quantum information processing protocols and is central to modern physics. However, the most profound questions concerning its operational meaning remain unanswered. Most importantly, we do not know how efficiently mixed-state entanglement can be (i) manipulated or (ii) detected, (iii) whether it is possible to formulate a thermodynamical theory of entanglement revolving around a unique entropic measure, and finally (iv) how entanglement can be exploited to reveal quantum features of gravity in experiments with gravitationally interacting quantum systems. A single key statement connects all these questions, the Generalised Quantum Stein's Lemma (GQSL) from quantum hypothesis testing. I have however uncovered [Lami and Regula, Nature Physics 19, 184 (2023); BBGLPRT, Nature Physics, in press (2023)] a fatal flaw in the original proof of the GQSL, which is now regarded as one of the most important open problems in entanglement theory.

This project addresses questions (i)-(iv) in a unified way through the GQSL. The road map includes five key objectives. (O1) Solve the GQSL with techniques from quantum Shannon theory. (O2) Expand its scope from entanglement to other quantum resources and from states to processes. (O3) Design new entanglement measures and use them to obtain tight constraints on entanglement manipulation. (O4) Determine the ultimate performances of quantum communication networks, and characterise entanglement in many-body systems. Finally, (O5) investigate quantum gravitational experiments systematically with the formalism of quantum hypothesis testing, formulating a complete proposal of a new type of `dynamical' quantum gravitational experiment. Thanks to my strong track record in quantum information theory, entanglement theory, and their applications to fundamental physics problems, I am in an ideal position to complete this project, whose goal is to build new bridges connecting these three key areas.",1623552,2025,2030,ERC,Italy,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Protocells in the Archaean Rock Record: Implications for the Origin of Life and Detection of Biosignatures,"Fossilised remains of protocells transitioning towards the first living organisms may be observable in the early rock record distorting our interpretation of biosignatures. Protocells – cellular structures existing prior to the emergence of life – would have comprised simple membranes and molecular machinery. The formation of complex protocells is poorly understood. The interpretation of fossilised microorganisms in the early rock record is steeped in controversy. The potential for abiotic microstructures to further complicate this interpretation has long been recognised but has not been systematically tested. Evidence suggests that prebiotic structures are very difficult to distinguish from microfossils. However, little is known about the chemical and physical characteristics of these ‘biomorphs’ that may enable us to tell the difference. This project will use a novel microfluidic approach to expand the experimental scope for formation of protocells of increasing complexity. Resulting microstructures will undergo silicification and diagenesis, the principal preservation pathway for early Archean microfossils. State-of-the-art analytical techniques will be used to characterise biomorphs, providing the first rigorous investigation of the feasibility of protocell preservation and how this might express in the geological record. These data combined with a predictive model and biological controls will allow for identification of key observables that will act as biogenicity indicators. Purported microfossils will then be examined and reinterpreted using the novel biosignatures. This project has the capacity to represent a paradigm shift in our fundamental understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere in the Solar System. Collectively this will represent a major advance in our understanding of the geological record, providing the first comprehensive methodology to distinguish between abiotic, prebiotic, and biological microstructures.",1623340,2024,2029,ERC,Ireland,EU,Earth Sciences; Geochemistry; Geology; Astronomical Sciences
Dissecting Dust in the Distant Universe: A Panchromatic Study with JWST and ALMA,"At the core of galaxy evolution is the evolution of the baryonic components that modify the observable properties of galaxies. A crucial component of the baryonic matter is the interstellar medium (ISM) that consists of gas and solid-phase metals called dust. Interstellar dust determines how galaxies look like from UV to IR, how the ISM behaves, and the very process of star formation that creates the stellar component that defines a galaxy. Despite our wealth of knowledge about dust in local galaxies, very little is known about the properties of dust grains, where it resides inside galaxies, and how it is formed, beyond the nearby Universe (i.e., at high redshifts). The fundamental importance of advancing our knowledge about dust at high redshifts is further underlined by the vital need to correct for its attenuation effects in the observed rest-frame UV/optical emission of high-redshift galaxies. This situation will fundamentally change in the next few years owing to the unprecedented capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This ERC program capitalizes on the massive technological advance of JWST to take a holistic approach, physically and observationally, and conduct a panchromatic study of dust emission and absorption properties at two key cosmic epochs:1) z~1-3, dubbed as Cosmic Noon, the peak epoch of cosmic star formation activity, and 2) z~5-10, the early Universe and the epoch of reionization. Owing to my leading role in multiple deep extragalactic JWST surveys, my ERC group will take full advantage of the very first data from this revolutionary observatory. This will be done in synergy with ALMA and other powerful ground-based observatories such as VLT and Keck to observe the attenuation and emission properties of dust from rest-frame UV to submm wavelengths at Cosmic Noon and beyond. This ambitious research program will bring novel key insight into the physical processes that enable star formation and galaxy evolution throughout cosmic time.",1623333,2024,2029,ERC,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Building excellence in the study of galaxies and cosmology at the University of Tartu,"The current era of large astronomical surveys and simulations produces massive amounts of new data. When combined with new analytical frameworks, it will allow for statistical inference to tackle many unsolved questions, such as the role of the cosmic web in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The current observations show the environment of galaxies plays a major role in the star formation quenching, mass assembly, and even the orientation of the galaxies in the cosmic web filaments. To succeed in studies like this requires combining knowledge and experience in observations, cosmological simulations, cosmic web theory, and applied mathematics. This proposal aims to strengthen the research capacity of the University of Tartu (UTARTU) in these subjects. The advanced partners of the project are internationally renowned experts in hydrodynamical simulations, cosmic web theory, cosmic web finders, and applied geometric and spatial analysis. Thanks to the knowledge transfer from advanced partners, this project will provide UTARTU with the required expertise to actively participate in the next-generation galaxy evolution surveys that allow mapping of the cosmic web in unprecedented detail. In collaboration with the partners, an improved method for cosmic web modelling will be developed that builds on the experience of the Bisous model (developed in UTARTU) and other cosmic web finders that the partners have developed (DisPerSE, NEXUS+, VWEB). This new GalaxyWeb model aims to simultaneously detect the groups and filaments directly from the observed redshifts of galaxies and work efficiently with significantly higher target densities and the non-trivial selection functions of the next-generation surveys. This twinning proposal will help ensure long-term mutually beneficial collaboration between the four project partners, raise the international visibility and attractiveness of UTARTU, and contribute to the cosmic web studies and understanding of galaxy evolution.",1623291,2024,2027,European Commission,Estonia; France; Germany; Netherlands,EU,Space Sciences
Exoplanets and Belts of Exocomets Around Nearby Stars,"The conditions for the origin of life on Earth-like planets are developed during the last steps of planet formation, when the planetary system is 10 to a few hundred million years old. Of crucial importance are basic feedstock ‘volatile’ molecules for prebiotic chemistry, which could be absent from terrestrial planets that may have formed dry. The goal of E-BEANS is to study Exoplanets and Belts of Exocomets Around Nearby Stars to understand their potential to affect the presence of volatiles on terrestrial planets. Exocometary belts in the cold, outer reaches of planetary systems represent the volatile ice reservoir. Outer Neptune-like exoplanets can interact with them to send exocomets inwards, enabling volatile delivery to temperate terrestrial planets. Meanwhile, terrestrial planets continue to grow through giant impacts, massive collisions that can strip off their atmospheres, affecting their composition. 

E-BEANS will study these processes to enable major steps forward on several fronts. It will carry out a multi-wavelength exploration of the composition of exocomets in the terrestrial planet formation epoch, enhanced by the first model of the chemical evolution of exocometary gas, and it will link the derived compositions to exocomet formation locations, through population synthesis models applied to imaging survey data. E-BEANS will also study the diversity of planet-induced structure in exocometary belts, a signature of the planet-exocomet interaction necessary to scatter exocomets inwards, and will test an ambitious long-term plan to directly detect these Neptune analogs through ground-based mm/radio astrometry with future radio observatories. Finally, the program will explore the composition and mass of impacting terrestrial planets through the gas and dust they release as post-impact debris.",1623267,2024,2029,ERC,Ireland,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
ReIonization and Signatures of Early Stars,"Understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed and drove the Universe's final phase transition by re-ionizing intergalactic hydrogen is one of the long-standing goals of extragalactic astronomy. In the past two decades, we have discovered this ``Epoch of Reionization'' ended around one billion years after the Big Bang (redshift, z < 6), but the process is still poorly understood. We are currently undergoing a radical shift in our ability to observe this epoch with the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Early JWST observations have discovered a surprising excess of luminous z > 9 galaxies, implying stars may have formed differently in the early universe than we had previously expected. However, we can only observe the brightest galaxies directly. Enhanced star formation
in the bulk of the early galaxy population should have produced an early start to reionization, but this is still
very poorly constrained observationally. Excitingly, JWST finally enables us to chart reionization out to its
earliest stages and infer the properties of the first stars.

In RISES, I propose to analyse groundbreaking new datasets I am accruing as PI on JWST with state-of-the-art statistical inference frameworks to connect observations of the bright galaxies visible with JWST to the evolution of the intergalactic medium.

The key aims of this proposal are to: (1) test what drove the enhancement of star formation in the first bright galaxies; (2) establish when reionization began, to infer whether star formation was enhanced in the bulk of early galaxies; and (3) understand how reionization proceeded by connecting galaxies to ionized regions for the first time.

These measurements will push the boundaries of our knowledge of structure formation in the early universe, and enable potential breakthroughs in our understanding of the formation of the first galaxies, the regulation of star formation at the highest redshifts and the evolution of the intergalactic medium.",1623154,2025,2029,ERC,Denmark,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Staging of Plasma Accelerators for Realizing Timely Applications,"High-energy physics is headed for an impasse: the next particle collider will cost several billion euros, and while designs have been ready for a decade, they are so expensive that no host country has come forward—a problem that will soon impact progress in the field.

Plasma acceleration is a novel technology promising to fix this issue—with accelerating fields 1000 times larger than in conventional machines, the size and cost of future accelerators can be drastically reduced. However, there is a gap between what current plasma accelerators can do and what the next collider requires. Therefore, a recent R&D roadmap (European Strategy for Particle Physics) calls for intensified plasma-accelerator research, as well as an intermediate demonstrator facility.

SPARTA tackles two basic problems in plasma acceleration: to reach high energy by connecting multiple accelerator stages without degrading the accelerated beam, and to do so in a stable manner. Access to stable, high-energy electron beams at a fraction of today’s cost will enable ground-breaking advances in strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SFQED), an important near-term experiment that doubles as a demo facility.

I have proposed two concepts for overcoming these problems: nonlinear plasma lenses for transport between stages, and a new mechanism for self-stabilization. Can these concepts be realized in practice?

Making use of numerical simulations and beam-based experiments at international accelerator labs, this project has 3 objectives:

1. Develop nonlinear plasma lenses experimentally;
2. Investigate self-stabilization, theoretically and experimentally;
3. Design a plasma-accelerator facility for SFQED.

Reaching this goal will not only impact high-energy physics, producing advances in SFQED and as a major step toward realizing a collider, but also society at large: applications of high-energy electrons, from bright x-ray beams to advanced cancer treatments, will all become significantly more affordable.",1623033,2024,2028,ERC,Norway,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Non-abelian anyons in programmable lattices,"Non-abelian anyons are conjectured topological quasi-particles which shatter our understanding of quantum statistics. Exchanging two such quasi-particles can transform the quantum state in a way that cannot be undone without unwinding the exchange. The exotic properties of non-abelian anyons have puzzled researchers for decades, and the robustness associated with their statistics makes them an appealing platform for topological quantum computing. Despite broad research over the past decades, non-abelian anyons defy a conclusive experimental observation.

The goal of NON-ABELIAN is the realization and exploration of non-abelian anyonic quasi-particles. We will focus on two paradigmatic systems: quasi-hole excitations in Pfaffian-type fractional quantum Hall states, and Majorana edge states in the Kitaev chain. In each system, we will use control on the microscopic level to prepare the many-body ground state, as well as to isolate, braid, and fuse its quasi-particles. Using local correlations and interferometric observables, we will reveal the properties, including their fractional charge and their non-abelian statistics. The experiments are carried out on a novel type of neutral-atom platform. It makes use of ultraprecise holographic beam shaping, programmable optical tweezer arrays, and rapid ground state cooling techniques.

By studying the emergence of non-abelian quasi-particles in two complementary systems, this project will shed light on an elusive type of quasi-particle from new angles. This will lead to fundamental consequences on our understanding of quantum statistics and provide microscopic insights into strongly correlated topological systems. In addition, our experiments open avenues for topological quantum computing with cold atoms.",1622997,2024,2029,ERC,Austria,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Formation and Evolution of Exocometary Discs,"The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revolutionised our view of planetary systems and our place in the cosmos, bringing us closer to answering fundamental questions about how these systems form and evolve. These advancements have, however, mainly focused on the inner regions of these systems due to the difficulties of probing their colder outer regions, despite their importance for the formation and evolution of planets. These barriers are, nevertheless, breaking thanks to observational campaigns led by me and others with ALMA studying exocometary discs analogous to the Kuiper belt, and JWST searching for sub-Jupiter mass planets at tens of au. This ERC program aims to constrain how the outer regions of planetary systems, and in particular the debris of which exocometary discs are made, form and evolve. Such an endeavour will require transforming our understanding of three key and interconnected pillars. First, we must understand how exocometary discs form as their structures encode key information about planet formation processes. This will require developing the first holistic models for exocometary disc formation and their comparison with ALMA observational constraints. Second, we must study what processes shape exocometary discs after formation to be able to use disc observations to infer the dynamical history of systems. This will require studying the disc interaction with planets and even stellar encounters while systems are young, and comparing the outcome of these interactions with JWST and ALMA observations. Third, we must advance in our understanding of exocometary gas as it could allow us to infer the presence of planets, affect their atmospheres and the distribution of exocometary dust biasing our dynamical inferences. Only by developing these three pillars, we will truly advance in our understanding of exocometary discs, a key element for
deciphering planetary systems.",1622978,2025,2030,ERC,United Kingdom,EU,Space Sciences
Unveiling the mysteries of stellar dynamics: a pioneering journey in magnetoasteroseismology,"While stellar evolution has been considered one of the most well-understood astrophysical processes for decades, a massive revolution is in motion thanks to probes of dynamical processes in stellar interiors with asteroseismology. Through this study of stellar oscillations, core rotation-rate measurements point out a very efficient extraction of angular momentum in the depths of stars. It represents one of the most fundamental, yet poorly understood, processes throughout stellar evolutionary journeys. This critical knowledge gap casts significant doubt on our ability to accurately date astronomical objects in the Universe using current stellar models, as an efficient angular momentum transport would bring fuel to the burning core and therefore extend the life of the star. Intermediate-mass stars (IMStars) are the perfect laboratory to elevate our understanding of angular momentum transport in stars, as their structure and internal dynamics resemble that of low-mass stars in the late stages of evolution, as well as high-mass stars during the earliest stages. The recent discovery of surprising oscillation mode frequencies and amplitudes revealed the presence of stable magnetic fields in the radiative core of a few red giant stars, similar to fields observed at the surface of 10% of IMStars during the preceding phases and later on when they lose their envelope. The Calcifer ERC project aims at pioneering magnetoasteroseismology, through an unprecedented exploration of the evolution of magnetic IMStars. We will use observed stellar oscillations to unlock the invisible, unveiling magnetic processes controlling the dynamics of the plasma in the depths of IMStars along their evolutionary journey. The ultimate objective of this ambitious and unifying project is to deliver the first meticulously informed model of the magnetized evolution of IMStars from birth to death, fundamentally impacting our ability to date structures in the Universe.",1622978,2024,2029,ERC,Austria,EU,Astronomical Sciences
The Quark-Gluon Plasma through Energy Correlators,"The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an exotic state of matter made of deconfined quarks and gluons, which behaves as a strongly-coupled fluid, with no discernible microscopic particle-like dynamics. Understanding how this strongly-coupled liquid emerges from matter which, at very short distances, is made of weakly-coupled partons stands as one of the paramount challenges in heavy-ion physics for the coming decade. To address this fundamental question, we must probe the QGP at varying resolution scales. QGPthroughEECs proposes an innovative approach to multi-scale microscopy of the QGP, based on examining the structure of the jets' energy flux deposited on the detectors, captured in a class of observables finding their origins in conformal field theories known as energy-energy correlators (EECs). N-point EECs look at the energy distribution of all combinations of N final particles within a jet as a function of their angular distances. Much like temperature correlations of the cosmic microwave background offer insights into the Universe's time evolution, the structure of EECs across their angular regimes gives access to the QGP dynamics at distinct length scales. By developing the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) first-principles framework for heavy-ion jets’ EECs and computing specific EECs sensitive to elusive QGP phenomena, this project aims to answer several long-standing questions about the QGP inner dynamics. These include quantifying the role of color decoherence, unveiling how the QGP modifies the QCD dead-cone effect, establishing compelling evidence of medium response, and determining the length scale at which the description of the QGP in terms of quasiparticles becomes valid. As the person who pioneered the application of EECs to heavy-ion physics and with broad expertise in jet quenching theoretical calculations, the PI is in a unique position to achieve these ambitious goals.",1622934,2025,2030,ERC,France,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
The Milky Way as key to understanding the inward transport of matter to the centre of galaxies,"Gas accreting onto supermassive black holes that sit at the centres of galaxies fuels the most powerful engines in the universe, Active Galactic Nuclei, shaping the formation and evolution of their host galaxies. Yet, we have a poor understanding of how the gas is transported from typical galactic radii, R=several kpc, down to the area of influence of the black holes, less than a few pc. The centre of the Milky Way can be studied in much greater detail than any other galactic nucleus and is a Rosetta Stone to understand the physical processes that occur in all galaxies. Interstellar gas is transported from the Galactic Disc down to the central black hole SgrA* through a sequence of steps. The Galactic Bar performs the first step by efficiently transporting gas from the Disc (R=3kpc) down to the ring-like accumulation of gas known as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) at R=120pc. In the last few years I have led major theoretical efforts to understand and quantify this first step. However, these efforts have also demonstrated that the bar is ineffective in driving the gas further inwards. A long-standing question is how the gas continues from the CMZ to SgrA*. For the first time we have the possibility to answer this question thanks to new datasets and advances in numerical simulations. I propose here an unprecedented effort to solve this important problem through a unified analysis of all the relevant physical processes based on novel data and methodologies. I will combine recent and upcoming high-resolution astrometric and spectroscopic data with advanced stellar dynamical models to constrain the gravitational potential in the Galactic centre (GC). I will then use this potential to run cutting-edge numerical simulations to systematically quantify the contribution of all the mechanisms that can drive inward mass transport. This will solve the problem of the inward mass transport in the GC and will give us fundamental insights that can be applied to all galaxies.",1622934,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Revealing Elusive LIght particles with Cosmic microwave background surveys across cosmological Scales,"Neutrinos and other well-motivated particles from the Big Bang are gateways to much awaited new physics that will sharpen our understanding of Nature. Cosmology offers a unique arena to unveil their secrets in a way that is separate from, but complementary to astrophysical and terrestrial searches. The next generation of cosmological surveys will supersede the current, which is already highly sensitive to these particles’ fundamental properties. The first-ever measurement of the neutrino mass scale, a handle to its beyond-standard-model origin, has never been so close.  A novel approach to data exploitation is both necessary and timely. Perfect command of theoretical predictions of key observables and instrument knowledge must inform each other. A robust inference framework is required to compare and combine the wide datasets soon to be available. Without this interconnected analysis pipeline, the richness and complexity of new data will spoil detection prospects. RELiCS is the project to lead new Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments towards discoveries in particle physics. I propose a program built around my expertise in particle cosmology and CMB data analysis that will deliver new and robust limits on neutrino and light relics properties. The flagship experiment is the ground-based Simons Observatory, for which I already lead key parts of the analysis. RELiCS is timely: the analysis pipeline will be immediately applied to fresh data from 2024. The same pipeline will shape the analysis strategies of the two ultimate CMB experiments, of which I am a key member of: the ground-based CMB-S4, and the space-borne mission LiteBIRD.  My expertise is unique in that embraces understanding of the theory, instrument, data analysis and high-level science exploitation. Through RELiCS, I will lead work that will crucially support cosmology towards first discoveries in the neutrino and light relics sector and pave the way to robust exploitation of ultimate surveys.",1622039,2024,2028,ERC,Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Quantum simulation of far-from-equilibrium gauge theories,"Gauge theories (GT) are the staple of the Standard Model, and their far-from-equilibrium dynamics opens a window into the most fundamental questions of high-energy physics (HEP) and the nature of equilibration in isolated quantum many-body systems. However, this dynamics is often highly nonperturbative and difficult to probe using classical methods due to entanglement buildup. Through quantum advantage and tunability, quantum simulators (QS) emerge as a particularly suitable venue to solve this problem.

QuSiGauge hinges on developing an overarching framework composed of two main interconnected pillars: a technological one focused on designing robust tunable experimentally feasible QS of GT, and a phenomenological one concerned with a rigorous formulation of far-from-equilibrium quantum criticality and equilibration in isolated many-body models. The project will focus on the quantum simulation of (non-)Abelian GT, qudit quantum computing for HEP, non-ergodic dynamics of GT, and extracting far-from-equilibrium quantum critical exponents from dynamical phase transitions in GT. The approach is organized such that it provides both basic intuition and formal understanding, while emphasizing quantitative predictions accessible to state-of-the-art and near-term QS.

QuSiGauge will pave at least two solid paths to uncover new physics: (1) It will provide a toolbox for probing engineered exotic GT and gauge-noninvariant dynamics not easily accessible to particle colliders, yielding tunable platforms for investigating the equilibration of controlled isolated many-body models. (2) It will advance QS towards the holy grail of making them a reliable complementary venue for exploring collider-relevant physics. QuSiGauge will be of immediate impact to current cold-atom and ion-trap experiments, which are approaching quantum advantage, and will reach far beyond its immediate field, eliciting strong connections between condensed matter, HEP, and quantum simulation/computing.",1621948,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Quantum Long-Range Networks,"""Long-range interactions enable a wide range of novel scaling phenomena in the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of quantum systems. These dynamical phases are particularly relevant to quantum computation as they feature enhanced coherent properties and fast spreading of quantum correlations. Currently, long-range interacting systems evade description in terms of the conventional many-body theory toolbox due to their high-connectivity and to the appearance of metastable states, which pose a formidable challenge to state- of-the-art numerical simulations.
QLR-Net hinges on the construction of a unified tool, exemplified in terms of a prototypical many-body theory model, which reproduces the spectral properties of long-range interactions in a modular structure amenable to extensive numerical investigations. Then, the project will focus on the spreading of quantum correlations and entanglement, anomalous dynamics and ergodicity breaking, universal quasistatic dynamics, dynamical phase transitions, pre-thermal phases and universal defect formation. The QLR-Net approach is organized in such a way to provide both basic intuition and formal understanding, while making quantitative predictions for scaling phenomena that can be realised in experiments.
The study of quantum long-range networks will provide at least two solid paths to uncover new physics: 1) First, by reproducing the low-energy physics of long-range interactions in a system with “reduced"""" connectivity it will give access to novel phenomena, which shall also appear in fully-connected long-range interacting systems. 2) Secondly, it will provide quantum many-body theory with a novel toolbox to understand critical phenomena in non-homogeneous systems and their role as a source of fresh and vital problems, which could be realised in atomic molecular and optical experiments.

The Mathematical Analysis of Extremal Black Holes and Gravitational Radiation,"""The Einstein equations constitute a system of geometric, nonlinear partial differential equations that describe gravitational dynamics in the framework of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The last decade has seen tremendous progress towards understanding dynamical aspects of the Einstein equations.  At the mathematical level, great insight has been gained due to recent advances in the study of partial differential equations, differential geometry and microlocal analysis. The present proposal builds upon these advances in the context of the following two mathematical problems.

Stability and instability of extremal black holes: Extremal Kerr black holes describe rapidly rotating solutions to the Einstein equations. They sit at the transition between black holes and """"naked singularities"""" and exhibit critical geometric features.

This proposal addresses the stability and instability properties of extremal Kerr black holes and is motivated by recent advances by the PI, which cover linear and nonlinear aspects. A successful resolution would give fundamental, new insights into the fate of perturbed extremal black holes and the transition between black holes and naked singularities.

The late-time analysis of gravitational radiation: Gravitational radiation provides an observational window into deep mathematical aspects of general relativity. In this proposal, we investigate a key feature that is amenable to mathematical analysis: the existence of late-time tails in gravitational radiation.

Recent work by the PI and collaborators has lead to the first proof of the existence of late-time tails in a toy model setting, also known as Price's Law. This proposal considers the full setting of the nonlinear Einstein equations via the analysis of late-time tails in the dynamics of perturbations of both flat spacetime and black hole spacetimes. A successful resolution would have important implications for the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture.""",1621009,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Optimal Particle identification Of Single Site events with Underground MKIDs detectors,"The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ) would revolutionise our understanding of neutrinos by affirming their Majorana nature and shedding light on their absolute mass scale and hierarchy. Detecting its monochromatic peak at MeV levels, with half-lives over 1026 years, is a significant challenge. Scientists are striving to push the scale of experimental exposures to tons of material per years. It is only in a background-free experiment that sensitivity scales linearly with exposure, maximising the benefits of increased detector mass. The forefront of this search lies with ton-scale arrays of bolometers at mK temperatures, such as CUORE, which investigates 0νββ in 130Te using TeO2 crystals, known for their exceptional energy resolution but plagued by background event identification challenges. With its 34% isotopic abundance 130Te emerges as the leading 0νββ candidate, bypassing the need for the now-challenged enrichment process. 
OPOSSUM will revolutionise event detection by outfitting 12 CUORE-crystals with six quantum limited  sensors (Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors) and a thermistor. This innovative approach will enable discrimination of events by classifying them as Single Site or Multi Site Events. Through pulse-shape analysis, OPOSSUM is set to tag 0νββ signals with 3σ distinction from any background. This method has the potential to lower CUORE's background from 10-2 to below 10-4 counts/keV/kg/year. 
The success of OPOSSUM will  facilitate rapid deployment within the existing setup without extensive R&D or major financial outlay. OPOSSUM-1ton is poised to become the first bolometric ton-scale, background-free experiment that can aim at surpassing the inverted hierarchy scenario, i.e. <10 meV Majorana mass.

Ab initio pathway to deformed nuclei,"Nuclear physics is one of the main drivers for extending our current understanding of Nature, its fundamental forces and the organization of compound systems on subatomic scales. The description of atomic nuclei and nuclear matter connects microscopic systems to astrophysics and the origin of elements, bridging orders of magnitudes in energy scales. A precise understanding of the rich nuclear phenomenology and their emergence from the interaction between neutrons and protons impacts various facets of contemporary physics. Despite tremendous progress over the past decades a fully controlled description of nuclei throughout the entire nuclear chart is still lacking. In particular many experimentally relevant nuclei reveal exotic shapes and strong deformation where nuclear physicists still rely on the use of phenomenological approaches based on uncontrolled approximations with limited predictive power beyond the regions where they have been adjusted.

In my project I will develop new technologies to target deformed nuclei using nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory and study the impact of interaction models on the predicted nuclear shapes. Combined with a uncertainty quantification of many-body observables this allows for unprecedented predictions of nuclei far away from shell closures – significantly extending the scope of first principles nuclear structure calculations. The novelty and challenge of the proposed research lies in (i) the design of many-body frameworks applicable to deformed nuclei, (ii) statistical analyses for uncertainty quantification and (iii) the establishment of tensor network approaches in ab initio simulations. This array of developments, puts me in the unique position to tackle the following big research questions: How does nuclear deformation emerge in a first-principles approach? What are the overall uncertainties associated to an ab initio computation? What is the most efficient way of describing exotic nuclei?",1620862,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Probing cosmic large-scale structure beyond the average,"The cosmic large-scale structure is entering a new ‘full space’ era with the launch of the Euclid galaxy survey satellite in 2023 coinciding with the first light for the Rubin Observatory. My proposal is centred on using galaxy surveys across a third of the sky as a laboratory for fundamental physics beyond the standard model by combining powerful theoretical models with exquisite data for galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To fully realise the potential of Euclid’s ‘full space’ galaxy survey, I will use my unique expertise in developing analytical, computational and statistical methods to predict and analyse the cosmic large-scale structure beyond the average.
I will hunt for fundamental physics by going beyond the average probed by standard two-point analyses and unlocking additional information from novel clustering statistics sensitive to different density environments. I will provide new insights into dark matter dynamics and enable a field-based analysis by pioneering a particle-wave duality inspired phase-space technique that goes beyond the average effective fluid modelling. This will push forward modelling to a new level, overcome limitations of standard fluid and N-body methods, and enable the joint modelling of dark matter, baryons and massive neutrinos.
 
My research program will unlock key insights into particle physics (by pinning down the total neutrino mass and potential wavelike properties of dark matter), the early universe (by constraining primordial non-Gaussianity providing hints for inflationary physics), gravity (by measuring the nature of dark energy and potential modifications of general relativity) and astrophysics (by determining the relationship between galaxies and dark matter).

Energetic Solar Eruptions: Data and Analysis Tools,"The SOLER project will investigate energetic solar eruptions starting from three perspectives: fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs), strong X-ray flares, and large solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Key parameters of the eruptions will be determined and their interrelations examined to improve our understanding on how the eruptive phenomena are linked, how they interact with each other, and how they result in acceleration of high energy particles and their release from the solar corona into interplanetary space. Large-amplitude coronal waves and shocks related to these events as well as magnetic connections of the radiation sources with the in-situ observers will be in focus as well.

SOLER will answer three science questions:
– What are the magnetic connections between EM radiation sources in the low corona and in the high corona and how are they connected to the particle radiation observed in situ?
– What is the relation of the properties of the in-situ SEP observations with the source characteristics and between the source characteristics themselves? 
– What are the reasons for the large variations in SEP properties and associated flare and CME characteristics?
Related to these scientific questions, SOLER has also technical objectives. SOLER will:
– deliver interlinked catalogues of strong flares, fast CMEs and large SEP events.
– deliver new tools for analysing and visualising solar eruption datasets and modelling results and distribute them openly to the scientific community.
– produce several high-level multi-instrument datasets and distribute them openly to the scientific community.

SOLER will use ESA, NASA and national mission data along with ground-based observations, and a variety of innovative data and image processing techniques together with cutting-edge models. SOLER analysis activities will directly lead to dozens of scientific publications.

LIght for controlling Reactive Interactions in COld molecules,"Ultracold molecules are the next frontier of quantum technologies: their rich internal structure and tunable long-range interactions enable the exploration of new regimes, unattainable with atomic platforms. Achieving this control requires cooling to ultracold temperatures. However, ultracold molecular interactions are dominated by lossy chemical reactions. Chemical reactions hamper the quantum applications of molecular gases and our strategies to reach the ultracold temperature limit, including the realization of the holy grail of ultracold molecular physics: a Bose-Einstein Condensate of polar molecules. Recently, I successfully developed several shielding mechanisms to protect polar molecules from chemical reactions and exploited them to realize the first quantum degenerate Fermi gas of molecules by direct evaporation. In LIRICO, I will leverage on these previous results to control the chemical reactions of ultracold molecules and thus unlock the full potential of molecular quantum gases. A high-finesse optical cavity will be the fulcrum of LIRICO to tame chemical reactions. Strong light-molecule coupling will create new hybrid light-molecule states, so called molecular polaritons, that will display the ability to turn on-and-off a chemical reaction by simply controlling the molecule-cavity resonance. The addition of final-state sensitive detection methods, such as an ion-mass spectrometer, will allow to fully resolve the microscopic mechanisms that underpin ultracold reactions. I will steer the reaction dynamics at will and control the reaction product distribution with the cavity vacuum, thus realizing a paradigm-changing, fully quantum-mechanical catalysis method for controlling the transformation of molecular materials. Cavity-control of ultracold chemical reactions will open new avenues in the dissipation engineering of inelastic and out-of-equilibrium processes, which is crucial for the development of molecular quantum technologies.",1620152,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Shedding light on dark matter with galactic dynamics in the Milky Way and beyond,"One of the pillars of the currently favoured cosmological model (called Lambda Cold Dark Matter, or LCDM), is the elusive substance known as dark matter, which is thought to make up most of the mass of the Universe. While the existence of dark matter can be inferred through its gravitational influence on normal matter -- such as the stars and gas observed in galaxies -- its fundamental nature remains, as of yet, unknown. Via its gravitational influence, dark matter affects the motions of stars in the discs of spiral galaxies in two intriguing ways: i) it stabilises these stellar discs against the formation of elongated, rotating structures, called galactic 'bars' and, ii) when such galactic bars do form, dark matter inflicts a frictional force on them, which causes them to rotate more slowly with the passage of time. Due to this intimate interplay between galactic bars and dark matter particles, the properties of bars will be highly dependent on the existence and nature of dark matter. Therefore, the observed properties of bars in galaxies, such as the one that lies at the heart of our own Milky Way, can help in revealing the properties of dark matter, thus shedding light on its fundamental nature.

While LCDM has been very successful at explaining observations at large cosmological scales, the model has a number of issues when scrutinised at ""small"", i.e. galactic, scales. Furthermore, while particle physicists have been searching for cold dark matter candidate particles for decades, no such particle has, as of yet, been discovered. This has motivated the community to explore alternatives to cold dark matter, which resolve some of the aforementioned ""small scale"" issues. However, there is still a lack of quantitative theoretical predictions for how these different dark matter candidates affect the dynamical properties of barred galaxies, such as our own Milky Way. Furthermore, our understanding of the dynamical structure of our galaxy is currently undergoing a major paradigm shift, thanks to superb data from the Gaia satellite and from large ground-based spectroscopic surveys. 

With this UKRI FLF I aim to disentangle the nature of dark matter, by making use of the interactions between galactic bars and dark matter in spiral galaxies, such as our own Milky Way. This will involve a three-pronged strategy: Firstly, I will decipher the dynamical structure of the Milky Way itself by using state-of-the-art models, together with data from Gaia and upcoming spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST and DESI. Secondly, I will produce, for the first time, theoretical predictions of the dynamical properties of barred galaxies in alternative dark matter frameworks. To do this, I will develop state-of-the-art cosmological simulations in these different dark matter scenarios, tailored to stellar dynamical studies. Developing such predictions is only now becoming possible, thanks to advances in numerical simulations which allow us to study bar dynamics in the full cosmological context. Finally, I will compare these novel theoretical predictions to the observed dynamical structure of the Milky Way and other nearby spiral galaxies, thus shedding light on the nature of dark matter.",1620047,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Particle and High Energy Physics
"Twistors and Quantum Field Theory: Strong fields, holography and beyond","This proposal concerns new strategies for the study of quantum field theory (QFT) in non-perturbative settings. There are complementary experimental and theoretical incentives for pushing QFT beyond standard perturbation theory around a trivial vacuum. Upcoming experiments will probe strong field effects from quantum electrodynamics to gravity, and proposals for extending the holographic principle to asymptotically flat spacetimes require detailed knowledge of QFT beyond Minkowski space. The fundamental quantity underlying these twin imperatives is the S-matrix: the operator encoding the scattering of asymptotic states.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of techniques employed in modern approaches to the S-matrix break down as soon as strong background fields or spacetime curvature are introduced. A crucial exception to this is provided by twistor theory, a framework encoding physics in terms of complex geometry. My recent work has demonstrated that twistor theory can deliver precision frontier calculations in strong field QFT and is intimately connected with approaches to asymptotically flat holography. 

These breakthroughs open the door on new approaches to QFT in strong backgrounds and holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes, as well as pushing twistor theory itself in novel directions. The team will deliver state-of-the-art calculations for scattering amplitudes and physical observables (both classical and quantum) in strong gauge and gravitational backgrounds including plane waves, beams, instantons and black holes, directly linked to detection targets at current or upcoming experiments. We will provide detailed bottom-up data for holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes, as well as using conformal and holomorphic field theory methods to create top-down models for the boundary dual. In parallel, we will develop new applications for twistor theory in its own right, in higher-spin theories, higher-dimensions and algebraic geometry.",1615100,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Bordism of symmetries: From global groups to derived orbifolds,"Bordism theory connects many central areas of mathematics: Defined via smooth manifolds, it has proved to have deep connections to formal groups from algebraic geometry and stable homotopy theory from algebraic topology. In particular, complex bordism serves as an effective organizational tool for studying the stable homotopy category, splitting up the homotopy groups of spheres into components of different wavelengths.

The goal of BorSym is to develop a similarly powerful correspondence that classifies the symmetry of spaces through novel connections to equivariant algebraic geometry and smooth actions. While such a relationship for symmetries has long been conjectured, it was only recently that foundational results have been established for the actions of abelian groups, such as the tensor-triangular classification of actions on finite complexes and my proof of the equivariant Quillen theorem. At the same time, bordism of symmetries has become a central object of interest also in the seemingly unrelated field of symplectic topology, where groundbreaking work of Abouzaid and collaborators has identified derived orbifold bordism as the universal target for Floer homology, thereby solving long-standing open problems in the field. 

In view of these events a new picture is emerging which paints a universal role of equivariant bordism, going substantially beyond even its classical role described above. The goal of BorSym is to unravel the full potential of this emerging picture: to thoroughly develop a chromatic homotopy theory of group actions; to employ the newly established set of tools to tackle major open problems in transformation groups and obtain new information about the derived orbifold bordism ring; and to extend the connections between formal groups, thick subcategories and bordism rings beyond the abelian case.",1610882,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Timing the cosmic expansion with gravitational-waves dark sirens: from compact binaries to large scale structures,"For 20 years, measurements of the Universe expansion rate from close-by and far sources are in tension hinting at the presence of new physics. Our struggle to study the Universe's expansion is due to the difficulty of observing cosmological sources for which the distance is known. Gravitational Waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are emergent cosmological probes that provide directly the distance of the source thus taking the name of Standard Sirens. Unfortunately, they do not provide the other ingredient to measure the Universe expansion: the redshift.
GravitySirens is an ambitious project aiming to measure the cosmic expansion with CBCs and exploit their link with the astrophysical environment to obtain implicit redshift information. GravitySirens will focus on the population and astrophysical properties of GW sources that can allow a more precise measure of the cosmic expansion. 
My team and I will exploit data delivered in the next 5 years from the GW detectors LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, the satellite Euclid, and Arrays of Radio telescopes such as HERA, MeerKAT and SKAO. By using a mixture of population synthesis codes and semi-analytical models, we will jointly infer how fast the universe is expanding and how CBCs relate to galaxies and large-scale structures (LSS). We will use state-of-the-art technologies such as machine learning and graphical process units to construct efficient algorithms for population analyses and use scientific data delivered in the upcoming years. 
GravitySirens will provide the most accurate and precise GW-based measures of the Universe expansion and measure the link between CBCs, galaxies and LSSs. On one hand, the cosmic expansion measures that GravitySirens will provide can potentially lead us to the discovery of new physics at cosmological scales. On the other hand, inferring the relationship between CBCs, galaxies and LSS tracers will point us to the processes acting for compact object formation.",1610832,2025,2029,ERC,Italy; Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Patient-specific Microstructural and radIobiological model for persoNalised external beam radiatIONn therapy in localised tumourS,"External-beam radiotherapy has been established as best practice care in different cancer cases, although current models applied in the clinics to tune the treatment plan dosimetry, as a function of the expected tumour response and radiation-induced toxicity, do not make use of patient-specific information, but rely on radiobiological parameters typically derived from in-vitro experiments, thus abdicating from describing the in-vivo complexity of the pathology. MINIONS is a cutting-edge research programme that investigates and integrates a set of activities to implement patient-specific microstructural and radiobiological models in personalized radiotherapy treatment planning and adaptation towards a detailed description of tumour characteristics of each patient and thus significantly improved tumour control probability. The main challenge of MINIONS is to create, for the first time, a real-time patient-specific model able to describe the microscopic characteristic of the tumour and its interaction with the radiation beam. The scientific activities of MINIONS are to achieve and merge: (i) Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of Diffusion Magnetic Resonance (DW-MR) signals and radiation-tissue interactions on a library of in-silico cellular substrates to obtain an integrated simulation platform; (ii) real-time Artificial Intelligence-based techniques to accelerate MC simulations and make them compatible with fast treatment planning and adaptation; (ii) advanced DW-MR imaging, to retrieve non-invasively the information required to feed the simulation platform for the implementation of patient-specific microstructural and radiobiological models. The design of in-vivo and ex-vivo tests allows validating the model performance and the collaboration of researchers, engineers and clinicians will drive the use of this innovative strategy in clinical routine, to increase survival and quality of life for a wide range of cancer patients.",1610380,2024,2029,ERC,Italy; Italy; Italy,EU,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
The Mathematics of Quantum Propagation,"Strongly interacting and strongly correlated quantum many-body systems are at the forefront of modern quantum physics. Experimentalists have obtained unprecedented control on the interaction parameters and are able to reliably produce striking fundamental phenomena. These problems demand a rigorous mathematical treatment, but analytical methods are extremely scarce. Outside of special scaling limits, the gold standard are Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) which provide an a priori bound on the speed of information propagation with broad physical implications. However, for the important classes of (A) lattice bosons and (B) continuum fermions and continuum bosons, the standard derivations of Lieb-Robinson bounds break down because these systems have unbounded interactions.
The first goal of this project is to establish propagation bounds, including LRBs, for lattice bosons and to identify the true behavior of information propagation for these systems. This is the missing puzzle piece to develop a quantum information theory of lattice bosons that is on par with the revolutionary findings for quantum spin systems. The second goal is to develop propagation bounds, including LRBs, for continuum fermions and bosons. These systems present even more fundamental challenges due to ultraviolet divergences. As an application, I aim to close a glaring gap in our understanding of continuum quantum many-body systems: the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the dynamics. I recently developed the ASTLO method which uses bootstrapped differential inequalities, microlocal-inspired resolvent expansions, and multiscale iteration to pioneer particle propagation bounds for the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. This resolved longstanding problems in mathematical physics. My new ASTLO method is a robust proof template. In combination with the technique of truncated dynamics, it enables me to now tackle even more challenging open problems about information propagation.",1602496,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Towards a practical quantum advantage: Confronting the quantum many-body problem using quantum computers,"The quantum behaviour of many interacting particles leads to the emergence of exotic quantum materials, which promise to make
our transport, computers, and power supplies faster, more energy efficient, and cheaper to run. Unfortunately, we have no analytic
solution to the quantum many-body problem and realistic numerical simulations are far beyond the reach of the world's
supercomputers. This chasm between our simulations and the real-world leaves us searching in the dark for the societal revolutions
promised by quantum materials.

In recent years, hype has been escalating around quantum computing as a solution to many unsolved problems, including the
quantum many-body problem. Quantum computing provides a completely new paradigm for computation based on the precise
engineering and control of quantum many-body systems, with experiments already beyond proof-of-concept. While quantum
computers are still in their infancy, we are already experiencing in our everyday lives the impact of machine learning. Given the
potential of quantum computing, it is natural to explore how quantum technology can foster even more powerful machine learning
tools, and in-turn how machine learning can facilitate the use of quantum computers.

This cross-disciplinary research programme has the ambitious goal of realising a practical quantum advantage using near-term
quantum computers. We will establish practical applications for quantum computers, beyond the access of classical numerical
methods. This programme is designed to exploit and develop relationships between quantum entanglement, quantum computing,
and machine learning. We put these relationships at the centre of our proposal to generate new approaches to confront the quantum
many-body problem, which could ultimately guide the synthesis of new quantum materials.",1601770,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Information and Computing Sciences; Quantum Physics"
Analytic methods for Dynamical systems and Geometry,"The aim of this project is to study a broad class of dynamical systems by using tools from the fields of harmonic analysis and PDEs (semiclassical, microlocal analysis), and to apply these new results to a variety of problems of geometric origin.

In a first part, we will mainly focus on systems exhibiting a weak hyperbolic behaviour (partially, non-uniformly hyperbolic systems) for which analytic techniques are far less understood compared to the uniformly hyperbolic setting. We plan to study statistical properties of such systems, and the regularity of solutions to transport / cohomological equations. Then, we will address rigidity questions in geometry and dynamics such as marked length spectrum or boundary / lens rigidity, Katok's entropy conjecture. In a third part, we aim to study Anosov representations and meromorphic extension of related Poincaré series via microlocal techniques. We expect the tools developed in the first part will help to understand part two and three. 

1) Statistics of weakly hyperbolic flows, study of transport questions. Ergodicity, mixing, polynomial or exponential mixing of partially hyperbolic / non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. We also plan to study cohomological equations and prove Liv\v sic-type theorems. Finally, we will study equilibrium measures (existence, uniqueness, and properties) for compact extensions of Anosov diffeos / flows.

2) Geometric and dynamical rigidity for flows / actions. Marked or unmarked length spectrum rigidity conjecture for (non-)uniformly hyperbolic geodesic flows, lens and boundary rigidity, Katok's entropy rigidity conjecture, rigidity of Anosov actions (Katok-Spatzier's conjecture), Kanai's regularity conjecture. 

3) Anosov representations. Spectral theory of Anosov actions on infinite volume manifolds, meromorphic extensions of Poincaré series.

SM has been observed in a series of semi-leptonic decays of B-mesons (B anomalies). It is undeniable though that the third generation
of fermion families have a special role in the SM and beyond and their study represents the pathway towards accessing new particles
and forces. Taking into account the current exploitation of LHC data and the constraints set to new particles and forces in recent
years, it is time to devote greater scientific focus to the search for new light particles that specially couple to third generation quarks.
These particles might be within reach of the LHC, but haven’t been discovered yet due to experimental limitations (triggers). BARD is
a new experimental technique that overcomes the limitations of light particle searches and provides a new way of performing data
analysis searches for these particles. BARD will achieve this goal by advancing high-momentum resonance search methods using

Tracking Hydrates In Refined Sub-neptunes to Tackle their Emergence and Evolution,"""THIRSTEE is a ground-breaking project focusing on sub-Neptunes, a class of planets with masses and radii between those of Earth and Neptune. These planets are the most common in the Galaxy, especially around Sun-like stars, but the most basic questions about their origin and nature remain unanswered. Are sub-Neptunes """"gas dwarfs"""" (Earth-like cores surrounded by large hydrogen-rich envelopes formed near their observed close-in locations) or """"water worlds"""" (planets formed beyond the snow line composed of a 1:1 mixture of ice and rock)? If the latter exist, what are their demographic and individual properties and how do they depend on stellar host type? Do any of them harbour liquid water oceans below their atmospheres?

The gas dwarf hypothesis has the most traction in the field, but recent evidence suggests the existence of water worlds. The observations, however, can be explained by both scenarios due to the modelling degeneracies that surround these planets. THIRSTEE aims to solve this debate using a multi-technique approach combining transit, radial velocity and atmospheric characterization data with a novel statistical framework that accounts for observational biases. This dataset constitutes a valuable addition to the community, enlarging the known sample into unexplored regions of the parameter space and enabling a direct comparison with synthetic planet populations. 

THIRSTEE is designed to mitigate all the shortcomings that have prevented previous studies from reaching conclusive results about this enigmatic population. For the first time, such an ambitious program can be pursued thanks to the simultaneous operation of state-of-the-art observational facilities. The project seeks to answer key questions about sub-Neptune formation and evolution, their atmospheres, and their demographic properties. Thanks to its unique approach, THIRSTEE will revolutionize our understanding of sub-Neptunes and their potential significance in the search for life beyond Earth.""",1600624,2025,2030,ERC,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Unravelling the Dark Universe from the Canary Islands Observatories,"Astrophysical and cosmological observations imply that only 5% of the energy of the Universe is made of conventional matter. The
rest is composed by a new type of matter, the so-called dark matter, which has no (or extremely weak) interactions with the known
particles, and a yet more puzzling repulsive form of energy accelerating the universe's expansion (dark energy). Advancing our
knowledge on the nature of this dark universe is the focus of a global multidisciplinary effort in astroparticle physics. Indeed, solving these puzzles have been identified as a priority for the future of particle physics and cosmology by several scientific agencies worldwide.  

In this context, UNDARK’s main objective is to transform the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) into a world-class institution in astroparticle physics. This will be accomplished by leveraging IAC's expertise in astronomy and astrophysics with the excellence and theoretical expertise provided by the world’s leading particle physics laboratory (CERN), and three renowned EU institutions in astroparticle physics. UNDARK's work plan includes an ambitious program of networking, scientific events, staff exchanges and scientific collaborations that will significantly enhance the IAC's research capacity and creativity, and will increase its reputation within the EU and global R&I systems. This will be complemented by an extensive outreach program developed in parallel which aims to boost the recognition of the IAC within the general public and public funding bodies. Finally, UNDARK also incorporates training activities focused on research management to increase the management capacity of the IAC and its involvement in HE funding programs.

Motivic Stable Homotopy Theory: a New Foundation and a Bridge to p-Adic and Complex Geometry,"This project is centered on the field of algebraic geometry and involves homotopy theory and analytic geometry. The overall goal is to unveil the underlying principles of a large variety of cohomology theories in algebraic and analytic geometry and develop robust foundations that facilitate the study of those cohomology theories from the vantage point of homotopy theory. This will be achieved through innovations of motivic stable homotopy theory beyond the current technical limitations of A1-homotopy invariance. In addition, its interdisciplinary perspective will be advanced, especially in relation to p-adic geometry and complex geometry. The research proposal consists of 5 main objectives, which are organically related to each other. The first objective is to establish a six functor formalism, which would be the most important challenge in non-A1-invariant motivic stable homotopy theory. The second objective is to investigate the kernel of the A1-localization and aims to describe it in terms of p-adic or rational Hodge realization, following the principle of trace methods of algebraic K-theory. In particular, in the p-adic context, this will lead to the p-adic rigidity, which will conclusively connect motivic homotopy theory with p-adic geometry. The third objective is to find out the potential of unstable motivic homotopy theory and develop calculation techniques. The forth objective is to establish a general and universal construction of motivic filtration of localizing invariants, such as algebraic K-theory and topological cyclic homology. The last objective is to explore the analogue in complex geometry, which is an interesting unexplored subject that will pave the way for further developments of motivic homotopy theory for a broader range of analytic geometry.",1591462,2025,2030,ERC,Denmark,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Black hOle Optical-polarization TimE-domain Survey,"Supermassive black holes form the most intriguing astrophysical systems offering countless opportunities to study fundamental physics in regimes not accessible to laboratories on Earth. Their multimessenger emission manifests in the formation of accretion disks, jets, and the acceleration of extremely energetic particles all of which are still poorly understood. Optical polarization can provide answers to such long-standing black hole physics questions since optical polarization signatures clearly distinguish between competing theories. However, the optopolarimetric data necessary for such a task are missing. BOOTES is a unique joint observational and theoretical program that can unify our understanding of transient (tidal disruption events) and steady (active galactic nuclei) supermassive black hole systems using optopolarimetry. The unprecedented telescope time (109 nights/year) and high-accuracy optical polarimeter available to the proposed work will allow us to produce (1) the first comprehensive optical polarization monitoring of tidal disruption events; (2) the first systematic very-high-cadence optical polarization monitoring of relativistic jets. Having clear polarization expectations from the state-of-the-art models we will uncover two fundamental black hole processes: the accretion disk formation mechanism; the high-energy particle energization process in relativistic jets – two open questions currently at a precipice of a breakthrough in black hole studies.",1591107,2024,2028,ERC,Greece,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Spin Curves Enumeration,"Enumerative geometry aims at counting geometric objects that satisfy specific algebraic conditions. The modern treatment of enumerative problems of curves has revealed deep connections between geometry, representation theory, and theoretical physics. These connections are established through the cohomology of moduli spaces of curves. The description of the structure of these cohomology groups is crucial in this modern perspective, and I will use spin curves to address this issue. 

Spin curves are refinements of curves carrying an extra sign, + or -, that enables the construction of new cohomology classes called spin classes. Spin classes carry rich algebraic structures that can be used to investigate enumerative problems. In the SpiCE project, I will study 2 open problems with this approach:
Problem 1. Dubrovin defined Frobenius manifolds to study deformations of enumerative problems at a cohomological level. How can we describe singular Frobenius manifolds?
Problem 2. How to enumerate curves in surfaces of general type?

Spin curves have been extensively studied through techniques from several branches of mathematics. Yet, a general framework is missing. In SpiCE, I will combine my expertise in these fields to consider spin classes from a unified perspective. This novel approach will provide the means to prove structural results and enable significant progress on Problems 1&2. 

Problems 1&2 revolve around 3 fundamental families of spin classes and their interplay, which frame the 3 work packages (WP) of SpiCE and their respective goals:
WP A. Witten’s class: prove a spin reconstruction theorem.
WP B. Gromov-Witten theory: establish Virasoro constraints for spin curves.
WP C. Strata of differentials: express spin Witten’s class via moduli spaces of differentials.
The outcome is a framework that provides new methods to compute spin classes. These effective techniques pave the way for long-term research on the deep algebraic structures associated with Problems 1&2.",1586304,2025,2029,ERC,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Atomic Scale Quantum Sensing and Information with Molecular Nanostructures on a Scanning Probe Tip,"The ability to measure – at the atomic scale – quantum states and their interactions, as well as fundamental observables such as magnetic and electric fields, and to freely entangle and teleport quantum mechanical states at this length scale is the dream of nanoscale quantum technology. Yet this vision comes with the daunting challenge of combining ultimate quantum sensitivity with atomic resolution in a mobile quantum sensing and information device – so far elusive for solid-state quantum systems. QuSINT will turn this dream into reality. This breakthrough will rely on a single electron spin being turned into a quantum mechanical two-level system in a magnetic field. Crucially, this quintessential quantum mechanical two-level system will be brought to the tip of a scanning probe microscope, to form a fully integrated and mobile spin-qubit sensor capable of sensing static and time-dependent magnetic fields on the atomic scale with single-spin sensitivity. Core of the spin-qubit sensor is a single, well-isolated electron in an open-shell molecular nanostructure. It will be fabricated in situ from single atoms and molecules on surfaces by atomic manipulation, and coherently controlled by electron spin resonance. QuSINT will foster “quantum leaps” in solid-state quantum technology and its many applications. For example, it will allow the ultra-precise characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale, transform the diagnostics of nanoelectronic devices and multi-qubit systems, and enable the analog quantum simulation of so far intractable many-body systems. In quantum computing and cryptography, it can also be used for quantum state tomography, and as a transport bus to entangle remote stationary qubits and teleport information, paving the way for atomic-scale solid-state quantum computing with spin qubits on surfaces. Combining quantum sensitivity with atomic resolution, QuSINT will unleash the quantumness of condensed matter at the most fundamental level.",1581958,2025,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Engineering; Nanotechnology; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Experimental Actinide Nano-chemistry for the Future of the Civil UK Plutonium Inventory,"In the UK, electricity generation using Nuclear Power is key to energy security and to achieving Net Zero. After six decades of commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing by Sellafield Ltd (SL), the UK has the largest inventory of civil plutonium (Pu) worldwide. The current and future management of the UK's civil Pu inventory by SL on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is one of the most important challenges presented by nuclear decommissioning. The difficulty and scale of the challenges are reflected in the provision of funding: £2 billion for the retreatment plant, £4 billion for storage until 2120, and £10 billion for future Pu management. The Pu inventory is in the form of actinide oxide AnO2 (An = uranium U, or Pu) or mixed-actinide oxide powders (MOX) and stored in gas-tight packages on the Sellafield site. Research commissioned by SL, undertaken by the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) at Central Lab, has revealed that there is a significant knowledge gap in the chemistry of actinide oxides. The data cannot currently be explained and show that the properties of the AnO2 have changed during storage. This has led to concerns about safety, and how to handle these materials going forward. Moreover, there is an urgent need to establish optimal operating conditions for Pu inventory retreatment and repackaging, which is scheduled to begin in 2027, and to ensure safe and secure inventory storage from 2027 onwards.
This knowledge gap results from the complexity of Pu chemistry under industrial conditions, and the difficulty of experimental studies. My insight is that not only are new experimental actinide materials needed, but so are new ways of studying them. This has been developed and informed through my recent secondment at SL, and working closely with key stakeholders (SL, NNL, NDA). The FLF will enable the synthesis of a new class of actinide nanomaterials, with broad application potential in nuclear decommissioning. This Fellowship will provide crucial experimental data on actinide structure and bonding on an atomic level, which has previously only been possible to study theoretically. Catalysis technology will be used to probe and quantify reactivity of actinide nanomaterials with problem industrial contaminants. This is also the first application of knowledge and technologies used in industrial catalysis to address nuclear industry technical challenges. This work is in partnership with SL and NNL and has been designed to generate data directly comparable to ongoing industrial work. Advanced characterisation and reactivity studies will be supported by the development of new spectroscopic tools. Synchrotron and neutron science will be utilised, ultimately in combination with vibrational spectroscopies, and in operando experiments. These studies will be a world-first. The impact of the FLF science will be realised through working in partnership with industrial stakeholders both in the UK (SL, NNL, NDA) and internationally through joint UK/US programmes (Los Alamos National Laboratory) and the European Commission Joint Research Centre (Karlsruhe). The translation of scientific knowledge to meet real end-user needs in nuclear decommissioning is a major goal of the FLF. This will be achieved by contributing to the scientific evidence base, therefore informing safety cases, engineering designs, and ultimately future UK government decision-making on Pu management.",1581594,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Entering the deep QuAntum Regimes of NOnequilibrium Thermodynamics,"Can we extend nonequilibrium thermodynamics to probe complex quantum phenomena? 

In the 90s, the scope of thermodynamics broadened to include small systems and far-fromequilibrium transformations. Building on these advances, the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics has recently lead to breakthroughs formulating nonequilibrium thermodynamics in the quantum regime. Motivations range from the search of quantum advantages in heat engines or quantum batteries, to the expression of global constraints on many-body quantum dynamics stemming from the Second Law. However, deep quantum regimes where largest deviations from classical thermodynamics are expected remain elusive, limiting applications: At weak system-reservoir coupling, a finer description of the coherent-dissipative regime is lacking to evaluate the resource costs of quantum control, optimize quantum heat engines or understand the energy transfers during a quantum measurement. This in turn hinders experimental developments of quantum thermodynamics in more platforms. To express fundamental nonequilibrium bounds on the energy exchanges with quantum materials and use thermodynamics to probe many-body dynamics, new coarse-grained description are crucially needed.

Project QARNOT will address those timely issues owing to a novel strategy combining cutting-edge methods from quantum open system theory beyond the most common approximations with newly-derived universal thermodynamic descriptions of quantum systems, to bridge the gap between quantum thermodynamic laws and experimentally or theoretically accessible physical variables.

By unlocking the deep quantum regimes of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, QARNOT will provide a new versatile analytical toolbox to probe quantum many-body and dissipative dynamics. Notably, QARNOT’s advances will be employed to solve the important bottleneck of the thermodynamic description of realistic quantum measurement, and enable a broad experimental use of thermodynamic concepts.",1578980,2025,2029,ERC,France,EU,Classical Physics; Quantum Physics
New Handles for String Scattering Amplitudes,"String Theory is currently the only  known theoretical framework that unifies the concepts of quantum mechanics and gravity in a consistent way.  As such, it makes concrete quantitative predictions for the interaction of gravitons in the form of scattering amplitudes. Unfortunately, the technical complexity of the theory is staggering, and most attempts to directly compute such scattering amplitudes beyond the leading orders have been stifled by technical difficulties.

This project aims to overcome these difficulties by applying three new and unconventional tools to the problem. StringScats's three-pronged strategy leverages numerical techniques, saddle-point approximation, and exact evaluation techniques such as the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.  It seeks  to crack the necessary hard computations in string perturbation theory and obtain a long-sought glimpse into the quantum properties of gravity. Among the numerous potential rewards  we would, for example, for the first time ever get  a direct handle on the analytic structure of a quantum gravity amplitude and understand the very high energy behaviour of String Theory and how it interacts with the UV-finiteness of the theory.
StringScat will also have ramifications in neighboring fields such as black hole physics, S-matrix bootstrap, number theory and the geometry of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces that features prominently in the calculation. 

Scattering amplitudes represent one of the handful of accessible windows into quantum gravity and hence offer great potential for tangible progress in the subject.
Despite the enormous importance of this topic in physics, it has received far too little attention. Recent advances in the understanding of formal aspects of the string perturbation theory, developments of numerical methods, and the increasing synthesis of the subject with mathematics, now permit us to attack the problem in earnest.",1569047,2024,2029,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"SPEcification, Analysis & Re-calibration of High Energy pArticle Data","Through a detailed analysis of very high-energy particle observations from the most important heliophysics missions combined with ground based measurements, SPEARHEAD will provide answers to three science questions:
1) How are protons accelerated beyond 100 MeV and electrons beyond 1 MeV in solar eruptions?
2) What are the release times and spectral characteristics of near-relativistic particles from solar eruptions?
3) How do coronal and interplanetary structures affect the transport processes of very high energetic particles?
To enable the scientific data analysis SPEARHEAD has three technical objectives:
1) Determining the response functions of a large number of spacecraft instruments to derive high-energy particle fluxes from observations at unprecedented accuracy releasing revised and completely new datasets
2) Performing cross-calibration of datasets measured by science-grade and monitoring instruments to enable the use of monitoring data for scientific analyses
3) Combining high-energy particle and context observations together with modeling of plasma structures for easier in-depth analysis of solar eruptions, quantifying their effect and delivering them to the community.
SPEARHEAD combines eight partners possessing the best European resources (in terms of data, models and infrastructure) in very high-energy particle research into a consortium that will deliver answers to the three science questions and consolidated datasets, methodology and open access tools to the community enabling breakthrough science on these open problems. The work is organized efficiently in 8 work packages with carefully picked top European expertise in each of them. SPEARHEAD will also facilitate the future application of its results through dedicated and comprehensive user engagement, direct provision through open access infrastructures as ESA datalabs, while strongly promotes its results and the value-added datasets and tools for the future heliophysics missions.",1543050,2024,2026,European Commission,Finland; Germany; Italy; France; France; Finland; Croatia,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Comparison and rigidity for scalar curvature,"Questions involving the scalar curvature bridge many areas inside mathematics including geometric analysis, differential geometry and algebraic topology, and they are naturally related to the mathematical description of general relativity. 

There are two main flavours of methods to probe the geometry of scalar curvature: One goes back to Lichnerowicz and uses various versions of index theory for the Dirac equation on spinors. The other is broadly based on minimal hypersurfaces and was initiated by Schoen and Yau. On both types of methods there has been tremendous progress over recent years sparked by novel quantitative comparison and rigidity questions due to Gromov and by on-going attempts to arrive at a deeper geometric understanding of lower scalar curvature bounds. 

In this proposal we view established landmark results, such as the non-existence of positive scalar curvature on the torus, together with the more recent quantitative problems from a conceptually unified standpoint, where a comparison principle for scalar and mean curvature along maps between Riemannian manifolds plays the central role.

Guided by this point of view, we aim to develop fundamentally new tools to study scalar curvature that bridge long-standing gaps in between the existing techniques. This includes a far-reaching generalization of the Dirac operator approach expanding upon techniques pioneered by the PI, and novel applications of Bochner-type methods. We will also study analogous comparison problems on domains with singular boundary motivated by a first synthetic characterization of lower scalar curvature bounds in terms of polyhedral domains, and by the general quest for extending the study of scalar curvature beyond smooth manifolds. At the same time, we will treat subtle almost rigidity questions corresponding to the rigidity aspect of our comparison principle.",1538331,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
COSMOlogy BEyond Standard Techniques: a program to exploit cosmic voids for precision cosmology,"Cosmology addresses the fundamental questions about our Universe: what is it made of? how does it evolve? Observations suggest that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion---to explain it, cosmologists hypothesize the existence of a mysterious component: dark energy. Despite major recent advances in the field, up to now traditional methods in cosmological analysis have failed to provide a throughout understanding of dark energy. Large-scale surveys, mapping the distribution of billions of galaxies in the Universe, allow us to look back in time and encompass the era when dark energy rises: they are a powerful tool to address our fundamental questions. The next generation of surveys, and in particular the ESA Euclid mission, will map the Universe with high-quality measurements reaching unprecedented precision; they will sample the galaxy distribution in detail also in the emptier regions with fewer galaxies: voids. Void cosmology is in its golden age, and constitutes nowadays an increasingly active sector of galaxy clustering analysis: by measuring void properties we obtain stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. Voids allow to perform a novel and independent analysis of large-scale structure data, bringing us in the regime of COSMOlogy BEyond Standard Techniques. Voids are extremely sensitive to the properties of dark energy and neutrinos, and are a powerful tool to test general relativity in a new regime. COSMOBEST is an ambitious ERC program aiming to exploit voids as a novel and robust tool to shed light on the puzzles of modern cosmology. It capitalizes on the PI's wide experience in building void science in large collaborations, with a strong focus on calibration-free techniques and systematics control. With COSMOBEST I will lead void analysis from modern data, guaranteeing for Europe a worldwide leadership in delivering constraints on dark energy, neutrinos and general relativity from the next generation of surveys.",1527422,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Quantum Synthetic Models for Entangled Matter Out of Equilibrium,"The exceptional features of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium are intimately connected with the intrinsic limitations we face when simulating their dynamics on a classical computer, as both are a consequence of the fact that quantum matter is entangled. Digital quantum simulators, or quantum computers, promise to overcome these limitations. However, in the current era of Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices, large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation is out of reach, making full-fledged quantum simulation an ambitious long-term goal. Still, NISQ devices already provide new horizons and opportunities for fundamental research in many-body physics. Indeed, in  their native hardware, they can be conceptualized as qubit systems evolving by discrete gates, measurements, and feedback, giving rise to completely new collective behavior and universal phenomena. This project has the ambitious goal of finding and theoretically characterizing new phases of matter which are exclusive to NISQ platforms, charting their largely unexplored phenomenology and possibilities. Taking on a fundamental perspective, at the intersection of many-body physics and quantum information theory, we will pursue this goal based on the study of synthetic models of quantum circuits and quantum cellular automata (QCA). The target results of this project include: (i) Prediction of new dynamical phases arising thanks to the building blocks of NISQ technology and identification of protocols to observe them in existing platforms; (ii) Deeper understanding of topical but hard problems in many-body physics out of equilibrium, made possible by the simplifying minimal structure of quantum-circuit and QCA models. The proposed research is expected to stimulate new synergies between different communities, reflecting the dual nature and interdisciplinary interest of NISQ devices, being both early prototypes for quantum computers and experimental platforms for many-body physics.",1521691,2024,2028,ERC,Italy,EU,Quantum Physics
Quantum Controlled X-ray Spectroscopy of Elementary Molecular Dynamics,"Elementary processes in nature, chemical synthesis, and functional materials critically rely on photochemical transformations. Monitoring these events on the most fundamental level and recording movies of individual molecular motions has been a long-standing dream of chemists and physicists. To this end, time-resolved spectroscopy uses carefully timed sequences of short laser pulses to concatenate stroboscopic frames of information, in analogy to a video camera. This has recently been pushed to the X-ray domain, where ultrabright femto- and attosecond laser pulses enable scientists to monitor nuclear and electronic motions in real-time. However, key features remain elusive due to their intrinsic weakness and the high complexity of their coupled dynamics.
My primary goal is to tackle this challenge and develop methods capable of monitoring fundamental molecular photochemistry with unprecedented precision. QuantXS is a theoretical program that puts forward the completely novel concept of quantum-controlled X-ray spectroscopy. I specifically propose to implement pulse shaping techniques at the pump, amplification, and probe stage of time-resolved X-ray measurements. This will tailor the spectroscopic pulse sequence for maximum specificity to so far unmeasured signatures of elementary molecular events. To achieve this, I will implement a bottom-up approach starting with the quantum dynamical simulation of a photochemical ring opening and its transient X-ray signals. I will then use optimal control theory to shape light pulses that (i) maximize the observable absorption, emission, and energy redistribution of existing, weak signatures and bring them above the detection threshold, and (ii) explore entirely new parameter regimes for time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy to generate conceptually new signals. By demonstrating these applications, QuantXS will push ultrafast X-ray sciences to new frontiers in its endeavor to measure the fundamental properties of matter.",1516660,2024,2028,ERC,Germany,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Black hole dynamics and the origin of supermassive black holes,"Almost every massive galaxy has a supermassive black hole in its centre, which grew from a small black hole as the Universe evolved. Such supermassive black holes do not only reside in galaxies, they are thought to significantly shape the evolution of their host galaxy and be one of the physical drivers behind the wide variety of galaxy shapes and sizes we see in the Universe today. 

There is no known way to directly form a supermassive black hole at the masses they have today. Instead, supermassive black holes started their journey as much lighter black holes when the Universe was young. Such light black holes, which then grew into supermassive black holes, are called ""seed black holes"". Seed black holes grew in mass through material that fell into the black hole, or through mergers with other black holes. To understand the tight link between galaxies and the supermassive black holes that we see today, we need to understand when and how seed black holes first formed and found their way into the centre of the galaxies in which we see supermassive black holes today.

It was long thought that each galaxy would easily acquire one such seed black hole when the galaxy was young but recent work has shown that the process is not trivial. Black holes in the early Universe often form far from the kind of galaxies where we see supermassive black holes today, or are very light when formed and easily ejected from galaxies, and the timescales for them to settle (back) into the centres of galaxies can be very long. We do not yet have a good understanding of how seed black holes travel from their formation sites to galaxies, and whether they are able to remain in galaxies long enough to grow supermassive or whether they often get ejected again. 

In this project, I will tackle the difficult challenge of how black holes in the early Universe move in and around galaxies, to understand when and how they first found their way into the galaxies where we see supermassive black holes today. To do so, I will combine powerful simulations with recent observations of the early Universe to study how a diverse population of black holes evolves in and around early galaxies. In this way, I will pave the way towards understanding how galaxies first acquired their seed black holes, and when the coevolution between black holes and galaxies began.",1513439,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Glacial sculpture in Mars’ ancient megachannels,"Mars is a hyperarid, global cryosphere, and likely has been for over 3 Gyr. However, during the so-called early Mars period 4-3.5 Gyr go, water flowed within thousands of valleys, in crater lakes, producing ancient deltas, building ice sheets, and possibly ponding in oceans. Surface liquid water was stable on Mars coinciding with the origin of life on Earth. However, this early benign climate collapsed with the continued loss of Mars’ atmosphere in the Hesperian period, ~3.5-3 Gyr ago. Outflow channels, megacanyons among the largest erosive landforms in the Solar System, date from this time. The largest one, Kasei valles, is so vast that the volumes of water involved in its formation were an important fraction of Mars’ total water inventory, and its outflow could have filled an ocean on the martian lowlands. In the current view, Kasei Valles was formed by a megaflood sourced from the catastrophic release of a near-surface aquifer, building on the basis of terrestrial analogue comparisons. This work aims to challenge this view. In this project I will explore the hypothesis that Kasei Valles was eroded by an ice stream, a region of channelized, fast-flowing ice within an ice sheet, based on its scale, location, and geomorphology, and reinvestigate the origin of other outflow channels under this perspective. Drawing from novel fluid dynamic simulations, analogue field work, geological mapping, and climate modelling, I will test the ‘Ice flood’ hypothesis, which if correct would radically change our understanding of Mars’ transitional Hesperian climate, the nature of its hydrological cycle, and the possibility of a Hesperian ocean. Outflow channels hold a key for understanding the collapse of Mars’ early climate and hydrological system, the end of global conditions able to support life, and the rise of the global cryosphere that would come to dominate Mars’ climate.",1511918,2025,2029,ERC,France,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience; Astronomical Sciences
Kinetic Limits of Many-Body Classical Systems,"This project studies the transition between dynamical laws governing the physical world at different scales. Our focus will be on large systems of interacting particles with random initial data, underlying the kinetic theory of gases and dilute plasmas. Central to this theory are the Boltzmann equation, and its appropriate modification for charged particles given by Landau. Their description of approach to equilibrium and irreversible behaviour is a legendary success in the physics of time-dependent phenomena. Nevertheless, the rigorous foundation of such equations remains a largely immature aspect of the theory. This is a major problem in mathematical physics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The effective equations of kinetic theory are an approximation of particle systems ruled by the time-reversible laws of classical mechanics. But their validity should become exact in a suitable limit of large system size. 

In the last decade, there has been substantial progress in the derivation of kinetic equations from first principles. Such work is restricted to rarefied regimes. Results are available for models of interacting monatomic gases of identical particles. Besides the macroscopic equations leading the average behaviour, results have been obtained for fluctuations, large deviations, and for the random evolution of tracer particles. Equilibrium fluctuations are in itself of great interest, including results on long time scales which justify physically relevant applications.

Most of the results hold only for an overidealized model of hard-sphere interactions. None of them is, with the present techniques, extendable to realistic interatomic potentials. The goal is to bridge this gap by proving the validity of kinetic theory for some of the most common interaction models in physics: such as the Boltzmann equation for Lennard-Jones type forces, the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation for mixtures, and the Landau equation for screened Coulomb potentials.",1511567,2024,2029,ERC,Italy,EU,Classical Physics
Emergence in quantum materials: from relativistic quantum criticality to non-Fermi liquids and unconventional superconductivity,"Understanding and controlling novel states of matter is at the heart of condensed matter research. In modern quantum materials we find a rich resource of extraordinary states which emerge from the complex interplay of quantum effects and many-body physics. They pose the fundamental challenge of describing an interacting system with many constituents in the quantum realm and hold the key for future quantum technology.

A major common trait behind the complex phase diagrams of many correlated quantum materials evades a description with conventional many-body approaches: a strange metal phase that exhibits non Fermi liquid behaviour nearby quantum phase transitions and superconductivity. QuantEmerge opens a new way to comprehend such non Fermi liquids and their intertwined phases by establishing a connection to relativistic quantum criticality and moiré materials. Relativistic quantum criticality arises at quantum phase transitions with emergent Lorentz symmetry and can be viewed as a minimal model for non Fermi liquid behaviour, while moiré materials constitute a new materials platform with unprecedented experimental control over such transitions. Their connection allows us to tune into the strongly correlated quantum regime from a controlled starting point in both experiment and theory.

Exploiting different tuning parameters such as interaction, symmetry, temperature, and density, we develop a comprehensive picture of emergent phases in a quantum critical regime with cutting-edge renormalisation group methods. We characterise novel types of quantum phase transitions in this setup and determine the corresponding quantum (critical) behaviour. We calculate thermodynamic and transport properties and study the competition of non Fermi liquid and superconductivity. Our theoretical insights will provide an improved understanding of the remarkable quantum-dominated phase structure that emerges in correlated quantum materials and pave the way for future materials design.",1501938,2024,2029,ERC,Germany,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
NSF-BSF: The Study of Nuclear Physics with Intermediate Energy Probes,"Although ninety-eight percent of the mass of ordinary matter is due to the strong subatomic force, many features of this force remain a puzzle. This award supports the study of the strong force by probing the substructure of matter. The PIs and their students will investigate questions about the emergence of bound three-quark systems and hence most of the visible mass in the universe, the nature of neutron stars, and the properties of dense nuclear matter. Answering these and related questions is a complex task requiring dedicated experimental observations and careful testing of theoretical predictions against measured observations. This research will foster discoveries in and advance the understanding of nuclear physics and will promote teaching, training, and learning. The preparation of junior scientists plays a central role in the supported activities. The nuclear physics research program at the University of South Carolina (USC) is based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia, and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. At PSI, the group participates in the MUSE experiment, which will address the proton-radius puzzle in simultaneous measurements of the electron-proton and muon-proton elastic cross-sections with positively and negatively charged leptons. Each of the four data sets will allow the extraction of the proton charge radius. In combination, the data test possible differences between the electron and muon interactions and allow for the study of radiative corrections, particularly two-photon exchange effects. The PIs’ research program at JLab will continue to provide crucial high-precision, polarized, and unpolarized observables that will pin down present problems in strong QCD. The elastic and transition form-factor measurements will trace the evolution from meson-baryon to dressed-quark degrees of freedom, probe the early onset of precocious scaling that reveals the three-quark structure of baryons, and hence address the emergence of bound three-quark states, the dynamical generation of mass, and the confinement problem. The PIs and their students will extract from their experimental data the cross section for lambda-deuteron elastic scattering. This observable will provide new and independent constraints on the two- and three-body hyperon-nucleon force, which is essential to understanding the composition of the core of a neutron star. The cross-sections for J/Ψ photoproduction off deuteron will give a direct estimate of the J/Ψ-N cross-section and a very first glimpse into the gluon structure of deuterons. The properties of hadrons are modified in the medium and bound proton electromagnetic form factors may differ from those in the vacuum, as revealed for the first time by the group’s earlier measurements. The group’s experiments on nuclear targets at MAMI and JLab will confirm or refute these results. The observations of such phenomena are potentially transformative in how we view hadrons and their interactions in nuclear matter. The award will support the group’s efforts to establish the physics case in support of the 22-GeV upgrade of JLab. This work would lead to the only foreseeable observables that could continuously connect the strong force into the regime where the Standard Model is firmly verified. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1500000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
The Origins of Massive Galaxies,"The majority of stars in the present-day Universe reside in massive galaxies, primarily formed during the first six billion years prior to z = 1. Detailed studies of the processes that shaped these galaxies are critical for our overall understanding of galaxy evolution. However, observing their formation at z > 1 presents huge challenges. The OMG project will revolutionise our understanding by precisely measuring the physical properties of massive galaxies, from z = 1 back to the first billion years. This will be achieved via my leading roles in three key observing programmes using two transformative new instruments. Firstly, the James Webb Space Telescope, for which I am PI of a Cycle 1 spectroscopic programme, and a core team member of the PRIMER large imaging programme. Secondly, the Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph (MOONS), for which I am a working group leader in the 200-night GTO programme. The project will also exploit my leading expertise in galaxy spectral fitting, established via my development of the widely used Bagpipes code. The OMG team will pursue three key research themes: (i) The emergence of the first massive galaxies: what are the number densities and star-formation histories of massive galaxies in the first two billion years (z > 3); do these suggest fundamental differences in star-formation physics at this epoch? (ii) The rise of massive galaxies at cosmic noon: what are the stellar ages and metallicities of massive galaxies at z = 1 - 2; do simulations accurately reproduce these properties? (iii) Morphological transformations in massive galaxies: what are the morphologies and resolved ages of z > 1 massive galaxies; how do these constrain quenching physics? In summary, the OMG team will use the latest data and analysis techniques to characterise z > 1 massive galaxies. By combining our results with state-of-the-art simulations, we will build a detailed understanding of the physics driving the formation of this key population.",1488664,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Collaborative Research: Stanford-Florida Program in Support of LIGO on Coatings and Core Optics,"In 2015, scientists detected ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves, created by two black holes merging, which launched the field of gravitational-wave astronomy. Improvements in the sensitivity in the Advanced LIGO detectors made this revolution possible. Planned future upgrades to improve detector sensitivity will require reduced-thermal-noise mirror coatings that are used in the detector optics. These improvements will continue to impact gravitational-wave astronomy for at least 20 years. A planned upgrade called A-sharp aims to reduce the thermal noise from the mirror coatings by at least half. The challenge of developing lower thermal noise coatings requires progress in the understanding of the physics of amorphous oxide materials, which is the core research focus of this collaborative project. The collaboration brings together experts in both experimental and theoretical aspects of this research at Stanford University and the University of Florida. The goal is to create mirror coatings that meet the necessary standards for use in future LIGO detectors. The team will continue to train the next generation of STEM researchers and professionals through their multidisciplinary activities and outreach activities. Future planned upgrades to LIGO will seek to install mirrors with further improved coatings, in particular with lower Brownian thermal noise (BTN), which is a key noise source limiting detector sensitivity. The baseline design for the potential A-sharp upgrade calls for a coating thermal noise reduced by a factor of at least two with respect to Advanced LIGO + (A+) levels. Synergies between the Stanford-Florida program and the Center for Coatings Research (CCR) have enabled considerable progress under previous support. Having identified, based on characterization via X-ray scattering and atomic structure modeling, the connection between room-temperature mechanical losses and edge- and face-shared polyhedral structural motifs, the team proposed Ti-doped GeO2 as a high refractive-index low-mechanical-loss coating. Subsequent experimental work in the CCR and LIGO Lab supported this identification, leading to the selection of this material for the A+ mirrors. The research conducted under this award builds on these results, with a goal of finding coating solutions with a further factor of two reduction in thermal noise for mirror upgrades and/or an A-sharp system. The group will work iteratively with deposition groups developing amorphous coatings, both refining the atomic structure models with data generated from the materials they deposit, and by providing those groups with guidance for next steps in their synthesis campaigns based on the results from the atomic structure and modeling efforts. While the major portion of our work will remain focused on amorphous coatings, the group will also continue to contribute to crystalline AlGaAs coatings by characterizing optical absorption and developing models for birefringence and observed excess noise above the expected Brownian contribution.

The community forming the JENNIFER3 consortium is putting together three research programs at experimental facilities located in Japan where very rare processes can be observed:  accelerator produced neutrinos (T2K and HyperK collaborations), cosmic neutrinos detection (HyperK collaboration) and a high luminosity electron-positron collider (Belle II experiment at SUPERKEKB). Such programs use different approaches, are sensitive to different “messengers” of the new physics world and are essential to complement the so called “energy frontier” investigation which is carried on at the LHC. 
Sinergy and knowledge sharing among them is the drive force of the JENNIFER3 project, which on one hand fosters the collaboration of European scientists with the Japanese research community, while on the other hand promotes close collaboration among different European research groups around key technologies, such as cloud computing and data network developments, machine learning applications for data filtering and reconstruction, photon detection, solid state detectors, particle beam monitors. Collaboration with private sector technology providers is also essential to reach the scientific objectives of the project.

Increasing Excellence in Utilizing X-ray Research and Neutron Scattering Techniques at the University of Tartu,"University of Tartu (UTARTU) is the top research university in Estonia and the Baltic States. The twinning project EXANST, “Increasing Excellence in Utilizing X-ray Research and Neutron Scattering Techniques at the University of Tartu”, is concerned with further raising the research profile of UTARTU in the field of materials science, by enabling researchers from UTARTU to take full advantage of the best European facilities for materials’ characterization.
In particular, the aim of this twinning project is to develop local expertise at UTARTU in the X-ray research techniques and neutron scattering techniques that are available at leading European synchrotrons and neutron facilities. Another aim of the project is to enhance expertise at UTARTU in the complementary computational methods that are used for materials’ modelling, and analyzing the data generated in X-ray and neutron experiments.
In order to achieve these aims, UTARTU will team up with three advanced partners: MAX IV (Sweden), an advanced partner in synchrotron science, Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ, Germany), an advanced partner in neutron science, and Imperial College London (ICL, UK), an advanced partner in materials’ modelling. Besides the research-orientated endeavours, the advanced partners will also provide guidance to UTARTU on research management, strengthening co-operation between different institutes within UTARTU, and tackling gender and diversity issues.
As part of the twinning project, UTARTU and the advanced partners will jointly carry out three pilot research projects concerned with (i) solid-electrolyte-interphases formed in energy storage devices based on ionic liquids, (ii) photoactive proteins that can serve as optical switches or tuneable fluorescence markers, and (iii) scintillator materials for radiation detection devices.

Closing in on Dark Matter with Superfluids and Quantum Technology,"Astrophysical observations require the existence of dark matter (DM) to explain how visible objects like stars move in response to the gravitational pull of DM concentrations like galactic halos. DM is our best evidence for the existence of particles beyond the standard model of physics; the eventual discovery of their nature will be of profound importance. While there are some well-motivated DM candidates, intensive searches for them are as yet unsuccessful, and there is high interest in the community in also exploring for more general DM candidates.

The central idea of this proposal is that dramatic improvements in the sensitivity of such searches are possible through wide-ranging theoretical efforts to help develop new experimental strategies based on emerging technologies. To realise this vision, I propose an innovative program divided into 3 work packages (WPs), each designed to attack specific blind spots in our searches for general DM candidates. These WPs are closely connected to each other, as the theoretical developments in all three areas significantly enhance the experimental capabilities of low threshold DM detection or are enabled by new data generated in new quantum simulator setups. As these WPs are developed, there is a high potential for spin-offs that benefit society.

WP1: As a member of the QUEST collaboration, I will focus on improving the sensitivity of the superfluid Helium based QUEST experiment to light DM, by a precision calculation of DM accumulation in the Earth's crust, refining my earlier work [1,5,6]. 

WP2: I will focus on creating a computational pipeline to automatically screen for organic molecules, that will serve as a new target in cheap, scalable detectors for light DM with low interaction area. The developed pipeline will be a versatile tool for general molecule classification, that can find broader applications in protein-molecule binding optimization and drug discovery.

WP3 will make use of the second research area of the QUEST experiment, which simulates an early universe phase transition as a quantum analogue system, and allows me to use my code [2,3] to predict the GW signals in heavy DM scenarios [4,9,12]. As I demonstrated in [11], those scenarios feature DM-bound states, and using my search strategy [8,10,11], combining gamma-ray experiments and GW detectors will ultimately test this challenging DM mass range. 

Overall, I am well positioned to carry out this ambitious, interdisciplinary project. In my career, I worked on topics ranging from physics to applied chemistry. In organizing workshops, seminars, and leading international projects, I demonstrated leadership skills. Finally, in developing and patenting (see CV) a new production method for an antibacterial composition, I gained substantial experience working with industry. This experience will enable me to strengthen collaborations with the industry and make the computational tools developed in WP2 available for broader use. 

My goals strongly align with UoL strategic research directions and ensure robust host-institution support for my programme. I will interact with strong local experts Prof. Coleman (MAGIS), Dr. Schaich (lattice gauge theory), Prof. Andreopoulos (Genie code), Dr. Burdin (XENON), and Prof. Greenshaw (CTA), which will be very advantageous for the investigation of DM accumulation effects, and complementary searches. 

To carry out the work and provide outstanding opportunities for my students and postdocs, I will take advantage of my strong international collaboration network. I will collaborate with Dr. Blanco (Princeton) who has relevant detector design experience, Dr. Leane (Stanford), Prof. Slatyer (MIT), Prof. Beacom (OSU), and Prof. Linden (Stockholm University) who are leading experts on astrophysical, and precision tests of DM.

Interacting Solitary Waves in Nonlinear Wave Equations,"Various models encountered in mathematical physics possess special solutions called solitary waves, which preserve their shape as
time passes. In the case of dispersive models, small perturbations of the field tend to spread, so that their amplitude decays. The
Soliton Resolution Conjecture predicts that, generically, a solution of a nonlinear dispersive partial differential equation decomposes
into a superposition of solitary waves and a perturbation of small amplitude called radiation.

Our study will focus on topological solitons appearing in models motivated by Quantum Field Theory: kinks in the phi4 theory and
rational maps in the O(3) sigma model. We expect that the developed techniques will have applications in the study of other
topological solitons like vortices, monopoles, Skyrmions and instantons.

Our general ultimate objective goes beyond the Soliton Resolution, and consists in obtaining an asymptotic description in infinite
time, in both time directions, of solutions of the considered model. Such a description should be correct at least at main order, and
reflect interesting features of the problem, which are the soliton-soliton interactions and soliton-radiation interactions.

We pursue this general goal in various concrete situations, namely: the problem of unique continuation after blow-up for the
equivariant wave maps equation, the collision problem for the phi4 equation, the study of pure multi-solitons in the regime of strong
interaction, and the multi-soliton uniqueness and stability problem. Their solution requires a mixture of non-perturbative and perturbative
techniques. While the former rely heavily on the concrete model, the latter will be applicable to any dispersive equation having
solitary waves.",1379616,2024,2029,ERC,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Fluid Dynamics of Deep Interiors in the Outer Solar System,"Understanding planetary flows is a tremendous challenge for fluid dynamicists and planetary scientists, because of their extreme regimes, the multiple scales and physical processes involved, and their indirect effect on observational data.

Zonal winds interact with numerous large-scale vortices, including the famous Great Red Spot, and together, jets and vortices belong to an extremely chaotic flow. Building on the discoveries of Galileo and Cassini, Juno has revealed that Jupiter's zonal winds are deep, penetrating over thousands of kilometres into its mantle of liquid hydrogen. In contrast, midlatitude anticyclones are shallower, not exceeding a few hundred kilometres. Juno also revealed remarkable dynamics at the poles, with polygonal clusters of cyclones, while Saturn exhibits a single polar cyclone with a polygonal jet at the North Pole. These structures raise many fundamental questions: How can we explain their formation, intensity, and size? Why are they so stable? What factors determine their extent below the cloud level? How do zonal jets and vortices interact with each other? Why are the polar regions of Jupiter and Saturn so different?

Ocean worlds are icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn thought to harbour global salty oceans beneath their solid surface. One of the primary goals of ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) and NASA's Europa Clipper missions is to investigate if the Galilean moons Europa and Ganymede have suitable conditions for life. It is crucial to develop accurate models of subsurface ocean circulation for assessing the habitability of these moons as well as their thermal and orbital evolution. However, it is a formidable challenge as the thick ice cover prevents any direct observations: Which processes drive the ocean's circulation, and what is the effect of rotation? Can lateral temperature contrasts drive a global overturning circulation? What are the properties of heat and material exchanges between the rocky interior and the ice crust? What would be the impact of the oceanic circulation on observables (gravity, magnetism, rotation, ice thickness)?

New observations and interior models have yet to be matched by self-consistent models of the complex dynamics occurring in the fluid interiors of gas giants and icy moons. Spatial observations are sparse and result from the interaction of multiple physical processes, making it difficult to reach a clear and comprehensive understanding. The goal of the project is to complement measurements by process-oriented modelling and to follow an original and multi-method approach, at the intersection of fundamental fluid mechanics and planetary science.

Our premiss is that key features of the dynamics of gas giants and icy moons can be reproduced in well-controlled laboratory experiment, where physical models can be readily tested. Water will be employed to represent either hydrogen or liquid oceans, and a rotating table will be used to simulate the planet's rotation. The goals of the project are to develop novel experimental analogues of (1) the emergence of zonal winds from waves and their collective behaviour, (2) the vertical structure of zonal winds and their interaction with stratified layers, (3) the complex interaction between zonal winds and vortices at low and high latitudes and (4) horizontal convection in the presence of rotation and its ability to penetrate into a stratified environment. By combining these fluid mechanics experiments with idealised numerical and theoretical analyses, I will deduce properties of gas giants and ocean worlds inaccessible to direct measurements, but also better understand underlying physical processes which are generic and applicable to other systems such as terrestrial oceans, atmospheres and liquid cores.",1340148,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Earth Sciences; Geology; Space Sciences
SinGular Monge-Ampère equations,"This project is driven by M-theory, String theory in theoretical physics and the Minimal Model Problem in algebraic geometry. 
We study singular Kähler spaces with a focus on their special structures (of a differential geometry nature) and their interaction with various areas of analysis.
To be more specific, we search for special (singular) Kähler metrics with nice curvature properties, such as Kähler-Einstein (KE) or constant scalar curvature (cscK) metrics. The problem of the existence of these metrics can be reformulated in terms of a Monge-Ampère equation, which is a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE). The KE case has been settled by Aubin, Yau (solving the Calabi conjecture), and Chen-Donaldson-Sun (solving the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture); the cscK case has been very recently worked out by Chen-Cheng (solving a conjecture due to Tian). However, these results only hold on smooth Kähler manifolds, and one still needs to deal with singular varieties.
This is where Pluripotential Theory comes into the play. Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi and the author, along with Darvas and Lu, have demonstrated that pluripotential methods are very flexible and can be adapted to work with (singular) Monge-Ampère equations. Finding a solution to this type of equations that is smooth outside of the singular locus is equivalent to the existence of singular KE or cscK metrics.
At this point a crucial ingredient is missing: the regularity of these (weak) solutions. The main goal of SiGMA is to address this challenge by using new techniques and ideas, which might also aid in tackling problems in complex analysis and algebraic geometry.
The PI will establish a research group at her host institution focused on regularity problems of non-linear PDE’s and geometric problems in singular contexts. The goal is to create a center of research excellence in this topic.",1338748,2025,2029,ERC,France; France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Low dimensional quantum fluids,"We will study theoretically various aspects of the physics of one- and quasi-one (1D and Q1D) dimensional interacting quantum system. The experimental consequences will be both in the context of condensed matter and of cold atomic gases. We will focus in particular on the question of quantum transports (particles, spin, energy) through a clean 1D and Q1D mesoscopic structure between reservoirs, and in particular when a magnetic field or artificial gauge field is present (Hall effects). We will also consider out of equilibrium (OEQ) properties, either by looking at mobile impurities and quenches and systems subjected to time dependent external potentials. We will study disordered interacting systems both in- and out of equilibrium. We will also look at the equilibrium properties of coupled 1D structures to obtain the correlation functions and physical properties of such systems.  These questions have their own intrinsic theoretical interest but are also directly relevant for several experimental realizations ranging from condensed matter ones, such as quantum magnets, to cold atomic ones. So a close collaboration with several experimental groups working on these subjects is planed during this project, both in order to test some of the theoretical developments but also even during the development of the theoretical analysis in order to be directly describing realistic systems. On the theory side a combination of analytical (bosonization, field theory, conformal theory, renormalization group, Keldysh technique and to deal with disorder replicas or functional renormalization group to name a few) and numerical (mostly Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique but also Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) in their various incarnations to deal with time dependent and/or finite temperature systems) techniques will be used. The project will be organized in three main directions. These directions have strong connections from the theory point of view.  All the projects are potentially relevant both for cold atomic gases and also condensed matter systems, and we plan when possible to build as many bridges as possible between these two classes of experimental systems. Quantum transport and Hall effect (clean systems):We will examine the quantum transports (particle, spin, energy) through a mesoscopic 1D structure.We will consider the effects of interactions both on the reservoirs and on the structure itself. We will consider the effect of losses and pair losses on the structure. We will study the effect of a magnetic field on the transport in ladder systems of increasing size (analytical and numerical). We will study the crossover in Hall effect between the ladder situation and an infinite number of coupled 1D chains.Out of equilibrium, noisy and disordered 1D and Q1D systems:We will study numerically and analytically expansions in the presence of mobile impurities.We will study the effect of external time-dependent bath on interacting systems and in particular pair association (cavities).  We will study the consequences of released impurities on disordered baths (thermalization). We will examine the finite temperature, finite frequency conductivity of disordered interacting 1D systems. We will study OEQ 1D interacting disordered systems with initial small charge imbalance. 1D and quasi-1D systems in equilibrium; bulk and edges properties:We will study through bosonization the effects on interactions on edge states in various topological 1D models. We will study several Q1D quantum spin systems such as Cs$_2$CoBr$_4$ (CsCoBr) and BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ (BaCoVO) We will study the dimensional crossover in bosonic systems made of coupled 1D chains We will study the competition between charge density order and pair order in interacting 1D systems with bath.We will study the physics of ladder clusters of increasing size to go beyond simple mean field in infinite coupled 1D structures.",1323522,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Theoretical Physics From Quantum Fields to the Cosmos,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Marc Kamionkowski, David E. Kaplan. Surjeet Rajendran, and Ibrahima Bah at Johns Hopkins University. The quest to understand the fundamental laws of physics is at an important nexus. While we await the discovery of new physics at accelerator experiments and ongoing dark-matter searches, existing null results have forced theorists to discard long-held theoretical preferences and think deeply about entirely new ideas for fundamental physics and novel experimental techniques to test these new ideas. This effort is also advanced by the development of new mathematical tools to help understand the structure of the theories from which our models of fundamental physics are constructed. The effort is now also advanced by exciting new discoveries in cosmology and astrophysics. The JHU particle-theory group tackles central problems at the juncture of theory and experiment in particle physics and cosmology and in the formal mathematical tools that are the foundation of physical theories. This group will advance new ideas for cosmological observations and fundamental-physics searches and propose new mechanisms and models that may ultimately help in the grand synthesis of nature's laws. The research will proceed in parallel with the training of students and postdocs who will evolve to become scientific leaders, and the group will remain vigorous in its quest to communicate the excitement of particle physics and cosmology to the general public. Theoretial research along these lines advances the national interest by optimizing our investment in major experimental facilities in their quest to understand new physical laws. More specifically, Profs. Kaplan and Rajendran will develop new non-accelerator directions for exploring the fundamental laws of nature while pushing to pursue a deeper understanding of the phenomena we see. Rajendran will do related work on new ideas for the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. Kamionkowski proposes to develop a suite of new early-Universe probes with forthcoming observations, and to study novel models to account for the Hubble tension. Bah proposes work in geometric engineering of QFTs and in the study of a new class of “topological stars” and their possible phenomenological consequences. There is much overlap between the boundaries of the research interests of the group members, and novel ideas will emerge from collaborations that emerge from these intersections. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1310000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
2D Magnetic Materials,"We will investigate experimentally 2D magnetic materials using nanostructured electronic devices. 2D materials are atomically thin crystals only a few atoms thick, which possess unique electronic properties, drastically distinct from those of their bulk parent compounds. Since the discovery of graphene, more than hundred materials have been produced in the form of atomically thin crystals. Magnetic 2D materials have been introduced only recently and their properties are vastly unexplored. Many outstanding questions remain because probing magnetism in crystals that are only a few atoms thick is complex and because atomically thin magnetic crystals exhibit new phenomena, with no analogues in bulk magnets. Our focus will be on 2D magnetic semiconducting compounds, and specifically on the interplay between magnetism and optoelectronic processes. Experiments will rely on devices such as field-effect transistors, magnetic tunnel barriers, and structures realized with van der Waals (vdW) interfaces comprising 2D magnetic semiconductors(2DMSs). They will have multiple objectives. One is to employ transport, photo/electro-luminescence, and photocurrent measurements to probe the magnetic state of atomically thin crystals, understand it, and to learn to control it (e.g., by electrostatic gating, by inducing non-equilibrium electronic distributions, etc.). Another is to explore the nature of the microscopic electronic processes responsible for the optoelectronic properties of 2DMSs. Major differences with conventional semiconductors such as Si or GaAs occur because electronic bands in 2DMSs are often very narrow, have unusual spin-polarization properties (rooted in the underlaying magnetic state), and because electrons can interact with magnetic excitations and textures. Last -but certainly not least- we will search for new phenomena expected to occur in 2DMSs. Examples are the realization of gate-induced half-metallic conductors (i.e., conductors with 100% spin polarization at the Fermi level by accumulating charge carriers in fully spin-polarized bands), the engineering and detection of non-collinear spin textures (e.g., in twisted moiré bilayers), and a high sensitivity of photocurrent to the circular polarization of light.Research will develop along three closely inter-related directions: i) the investigation of in-plane transport in electrostatically gated transistors devices based on mono/multilayers of different 2DMSs; ii) measurements of vertical transport in the direction perpendicular to the planes, e.g. by using different 2DMSs as tunnel barriers; iii) exploring optoelectronic processes in vdW interfaces combining layers of 2DMSs and of non-magnetic semiconductors to engineer their optoelectronic and transport properties. We will start working on materials that we have already identified (including CrPS4, CrSBr, CrBr3, NiI2), on which preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the planned experiments. We anticipate that -as the project progresses -the gamut of materials available will broaden considerably, thanks to ongoing collaborations that are synthesizing new 2DMSs. As 2D magnetic semiconductors form a vast class of materials, our research will have explorative character. The overarching final goal of our research is to understand the interplay between microscopic processes characteristic of semiconductors (electron transport, magnetoconductance, effects of charge accumulation and applied electric fields, optical transitions, etc.) and the magnetic phases (and their excitations) of different 2DMSs. Deepening our understanding will have  a clear fundamental relevance -it will elucidate the electronic processes that determine the properties of 2DMSs and razionalize the phenomena that are observed experimentally in different compounds. It also has potential for device applications, because the unique properties of 2DMSs may enable new type of functional devices. Since only limited experimental studies of the type proposed here have been performed so far, the likelihood to discover new phenomena is high.",1296082,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Precision Simulations for Collider Processes,"The Standard Model (SM) is the theory that successfully describes most of the known phenomena in elementary particle physics. In the last 40 years the model has been tested at an impressive level of accuracy, but no evidence for new phenomena emerged, and we can say that New Physics, which is expected on general grounds, is probably not behind the corner. Within the next few years our community must take a decision on the next facilities to be pursued, and the Future Circular Collider (FCC) appears to be an exciting option. In the meanwhile, however, the High Luminosity era of the LHC, is ahead of us, and it will lead to a wealth of high-quality data, and new exciting discoveries are well possible. A new-physics signature could show up as a clear peak on some invariant mass distribution but also as a small excess in the tail of some transverse-momentum or missing energy spectrum. To isolate a new-physics signal, a solid control on SM backgrounds is crucial. The lack of direct signatures of new phenomena in the current LHC dataset underscores the importance of precision measurements. On the other hand, despite the progress in precision computations in the last decades, the current experimental analyses are still largely based on next-to-leading order (NLO) simulations.This project aims at establishing a new standard of theoretical precision for a number of relevant physical observables at high-energy colliders and, at the same time, making the corresponding results fully available to the community. Our work will be carried out along three main lines:i) obtaining high-precision predictions for new processes featuring colourless particles,including mixed QCD-EW corrections where appropriate, and possible beyond the SM effects through an Effective Field Theory framework; ii) significantly improving theoretical predictions for several processes with heavy quarks, in particular obtaining next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD predictions for the case in which a Higgs or a vector boson is produced together with a top-antitop pair, and, for top-antitop quark production, including the top-quark decays beyond the narrow-width approximation; iii) developing a new computational formalism to treat jet processes, and obtaining NNLO results for multijet production in e+e-, pp and ep collisions.More in detail, we will extend our generator MATRIX to include additional important processes, we will compute mixed QCD-EW corrections for the Drell-Yan process with dressed leptons and will include anomalous couplings for a set of simple benchmark processes. We plan to compute NNLO corrections to processes featuring top quarks and a vector boson, by constructing appropriate approximations for the missing two-loop virtual contributions. There is currently some tension between the data and the theoretical predictions for these processes and NNLO corrections are urgently needed to settle this issue. We plan to compute NNLO corrections to single-top production in the Wt channel. We plan to extend our NNLO calculation for on-shell top-quark pair production to include the top-quark decays, going beyond the narrow-width approximation. We plan to open a completely new chapter within our computational framework by attacking jet production processes. We will first start from the simpler case of e+e- collisions. This intermediate step will allow us to extend our NNLO parton level generator to deal with e+e- collisions, and, possibly, ep collisions. We will then move to hadron collisions. The accomplishment of such goals will have a high impact on LHC and future collider phenomenology, paving the way to the systematic deployment of NNLO precision into experimental analyses.",1278351,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
An agile multi-frequency VLBI receiver for the South Pole Telescope,"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is an array of twelve radio antennas spread across the globe. These antennas are combined to form an earth-size telescope whose spatial resolution is set by the observing wavelength and the largest telescope. Observing at a radio wavelength of 1.3 mm, the EHT has made the first images of black hole event horizons. The event horizon marks the boundary around a black hole beyond which no radiation can escape. To improve on these results, the EHT will observe at a wavelength of 0.9 mm to get 40% better resolution. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a critical station for EHT. The investigators will build an upgraded receiver for the SPT - the Advanced South Pole Integrated Receiver for EHT (ASPIRE). The process of building ASPIRE will create opportunities for comprehensive training in scientific instrumentation for graduate and undergraduate students, with the latter selected from existing University of Arizona programs that support underrepresented STEM students through their college careers. The ASPIRE receiver will incorporate new state-of-the-art sideband-separating 0.9 mm (345 GHz) mixers currently being developed for another NSF-funded receiver at University of Arizona. The simultaneous operation in two bands, 1.3 mm and 0.9 mm, will maximize the resolution of the EHT array and enable atmospheric delay correction through frequency-phase transfer, which will improve sensitivity and provide phase-referenced astrometry between bands. A novel wideband digitizer system will see its first astronomical use and become available for many other applications. A new optics design will use a dichroic beam splitter to enable simultaneous observing in both bands and enable quick swapping between illuminating the ASPIRE receiver and illuminating the main SPT-3G camera. Together, these changes will make the best possible use of the SPT as an EHT site and open the door to new science, including measurements of the magnetic structure of the accretion flow and jets, millimeter-wave follow-up of multiwavelength and multi-messenger transients, time-variability studies, and the lensed photon ring.

Unveiling the complexity of radio foregrounds for the detectability of the CMB polarization B-mode,"One of the main challenges in Cosmology is the detection of the primordial B-mode of CMB polarization, which would constitute a confirmation of the inflationary period of the Universe. However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions.
RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources. It will also provide an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This goal can only be achieved by combining the ESA’s Planck satellite maps (30-857GHz) with the unique low frequency experiments considered in this proposal: QUIJOTE (10-40 GHz), C-BASS (5 GHz) and S-PASS (2.3 GHz), by counting within the consortium with experts on the previous data sets (including the teams responsible for QUIJOTE and C-BASS) and by using the most advanced analysis techniques.
The combination of these datasets will provide high-level data products, that will range from more complete radio catalogues, including fainter sources and additional frequency coverage, to new component separated maps in wider regions of the sky. These new data products and models will be made available to the scientific community through widely-used platforms, increasing the scientific return and the impact of the project. We will also provide forecasts of the impact of radio foregrounds on the detectability of the B-mode of polarization for future CMB experiments. The resulting analyses will play a key role in preparing and supporting future international CMB missions as LiteBIRD or ground-based efforts as CMB-S4.",1221932,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain; United Kingdom; Italy; United Kingdom; Spain; France,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Logarithmic enumerative geometry and moduli spaces,"Moduli spaces and enumerative geometry are central themes in algebraic geometry. Moduli spaces describe all geometric objects of a given type. Enumerative invariants are natural characteristic numbers of moduli spaces. They arise from studying the topology of these spaces and are often modeled on urve counting problems: counts of curves in a space subject to geometric constraints. 

The proposal aims to bring forward a fully-fledged theory of logarithmic enumerative geometry. Logarithmic geometry enriches objects of algebraic geometry with combinatorial data. It connects to traditional algebraic geometry by a process called degeneration. Logarithmic structures have been studied for decades but only recently have methods been developed to understand their combinatorial complexity. This is part of the subject of tropical geometry.

The proposed advances in this logarithmic direction are guided by the interactions between the basic objects of enumerative geometry: the moduli space of curves, the space of stable maps, and the Hilbert scheme of embedded curves. The interactions have led to remarkable insights, such as the Gromov-Witten (GW)/Donaldson-Thomas (DT) correspondence, the cohomological field theory structure of GW theory, and numerous beautiful calculations on the moduli space of curves. 

We propose a new logarithmic GW/DT conjecture, a study of the algebraic structure of logarithmic GW theory using orbifolds, and a new logarithmic intersection theory on the moduli space of curves. These will lead to results in traditional enumerative geometry, such as a proof of the standard GW/DT correspondence for a very large class of Calabi-Yau threefolds. It will also build connections between different themes, such as mirror symmetry and the Hilbert schemes of points on a surface. Finally, it will open an entirely new direction in the study of the moduli space of curves using tropical geometry.",1220642,2024,2029,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
NRAO/GBO Research Experience for Undergraduates,"This award will provide renewed funding of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU program will be offered annually to fifteen qualified applicants in three locations: Socorro, NM; Green Bank, WV; and Charlottesville, VA. These sites are the headquarters for the operations of the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), respectively. Students will perform cutting-edge research in several areas, including all fields of astronomy (cosmology, extragalactic, galactic, stellar, solar system, astrochemistry, pulsars, etc.), as well as astronomical engineering and computing. In addition to their assigned research project, all students participate in a hands-on observing experience using the NRAO GBT, VLA, and/or VLBA. The award will enable a pipeline of skilled scientists and engineers to be developed in the field of radio astronomy, which is critical for the infrastructure of NSF-funded facilities. The program has also demonstrated its effectiveness in retaining students in STEM fields: indeed, over 300 past participants remain in the field of astronomy. Finally, participants also receive instruction and experience with communicating their scientific research through oral and written presentation of their research project results, including the opportunity to present their research at a professional meeting following their appointment.

Physics at the LHC with CMS,"The Standard Model of particle physics has been a remarkably successful theory, agreeing with several decades of experimental observations involving weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions. The LHC discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was further confirmation of this success. However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete theory as it fails to explain dark matter and it does not provide an explanation for the mass of light neutrinos. Interestingly, these insufficiencies appear to be part of an intriguing overlap in the sciences describing the largest and smallest scales of the universe: proposed extensions of the Standard Model also shed light on our understanding of the evolution of our universe and the dark matter relic density measured by astronomers. This work exploits the rich particle physics program at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland to search for dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model. The expanding LHC data set collected by the CMS experiment offers significant opportunity for new discovery, providing greater sensitivity for new physics signatures which would address questions in both particle physics and cosmology. This research program is aimed at questions motivated by the synergy between these two disciplines, for example, by using events produced through vector boson fusion processes to search for dark matter and supersymmetry. In addition, this effort leverages searches for TeV-scale particles using tau lepton reconstruction and identification, which combined with other techniques, enables targeted searches for interesting new physics such as dark matter, compressed spectra SUSY, heavy neutrinos, leptoquarks, and new heavy neutral gauge bosons such as Z-prime. This research is also enabled by hardware operations and development work on the CMS pixel detector and on development of advanced machine learning data analysis techniques. In addition, the group will undertake multiple education and outreach activities, including the national initiative Quarknet, research experiences for Vanderbilt undergraduates, hosting intern days for local secondary school students, and hosting a ""Dark Matter Fest"" for students.

"BSM-PM: Precision Measurements and Fundamental Symmetries: Muon g-2, Electric Dipole Moments, and Optical Magnetometry","The description of nature at its most fundamental level should describe all matter and phenomena in the physical universe with a set of basic pieces – elementary particles – and an explanation of the forces between them. In the current state of the art, called “The Standard Model,” the normal matter that surrounds us is made up of electrons, protons and neutrons bound together in atoms and their nuclei, and the neutrons and protons are made up of elementary constituents called quarks. The Standard Model does not, however, describe everything that has been observed and does not provide an explanation of how the universe evolved with more matter than anti-matter; additional particles and forces must exist. The muon, like the electron, is an elementary particle and is produced as the earth is bombarded by cosmic rays from space and at accelerators. Measuring the magnetic and electric properties of muons, neutrons, and atoms with great precision is one of the most promising ways to explore the “new physics” of additional particles and interactions. This research requires developing technologies for controlling and detecting magnetic fields that also have potentially broad applications to medicine, geological exploration, and defense. This research focuses on contributing to the answers to these fundamental questions, developing widely useful magnetic technologies, and providing exceptional training for a diverse cohort of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs with broad skills, who will lead the way to solving crucial technical and intellectual problems. The investigations will take part at the national facilities Los Alamos National Lab, Argonne National Lab, and Fermilab, advancing the capabilities of these technical facilities and enhancing training opportunities. Precise measurement of the magnetic and electric properties of fundamental particles and atoms provides information that may inform the extensions to the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions, often called Beyond Standard Model or BSM physics. This research will continue collaboration on the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment with the primary activity of leading the analysis of the space and time dependent measurement of the muon-averaged magnetic field that connects the muon spin precession frequency to the muon magnetic moment anomaly and the Standard Model. Calibration of the magnetic field measurement chain using the Mark-II absolute 3He magnetometer with precision below 10 ppb (parts-per-billion) will be completed. The electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) will be measured using the world's leading ultra-cold neutron source at Los Alamos National Lab with focus on magnetic field measurement and control including continuing new developments of optical magnetometers, in part through commercial collaborations. The electric dipole moment of 129Xe will be measured with more than 10-times improvement over the current precision using the Los Alamos nEDM magnetics systems. Throughout, this research will advance novel approaches to monitoring magnetic fields using arrays of magnetometers that apply to both the Fermilab and Los Alamos experiments.

DARES - Data Assimilation Revolution in Space Weather Forecasting,"With this Future Leaders Fellowship, I will lead a research team that will build the first self-consistent data assimilation (DA) and continuous verification scheme for space weather forecasting, which is critically needed to improve our physical understanding of, and preparedness for, hazardous space weather.

Space weather is a global natural hazard which can severely impact society, industry, and be a risk-to-life. It is a known risk to energy security, communications, aviation, and satellite services. 

Severe space weather is driven by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), which are violent eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun's atmosphere. Cost-effective mitigation of space weather therefore relies on forecasting the arrival and properties of CMEs at Earth. Due to the potential seriousness of space weather, it is included in the UK's National Risk Register, and is planned for in the UK's Severe Space Weather Preparedness Strategy. Thus there is a crucial need to both better understand the physics of CMEs and to improve space weather forecasting capability. However, CME prediction has failed to improve in a decade of intense research, due to both knowledge gaps and observational limitations.
Sophisticated computer models are used to simulate CMEs flowing through the solar wind to Earth. However, although these models are grounded in the relevant physics, they struggle to accurately represent observed CMEs. There are two key reasons for this; firstly, the starting conditions of these models are very uncertain due to observational limitations; secondly, the representation and balance of processes in the models is incorrect - indicative of our limited knowledge of physics controlling CMEs.

Heliospheric Imagers (HI), such as those developed by UKRI's STFC for NASA's STEREO mission, provide the only consistent observations of CMEs and the solar wind flowing over the whole domain from the top of the solar atmosphere to Earth. These observations show CMEs being both distorted and eroded as they flow through the highly structured solar wind, but they are under-exploited in space weather research and forecasting.

DA is the process of combining models and observations, accounting for the uncertainty in each, to provide a best estimate of a system's state. By assimilating a wide range of meteorological observations, DA has revolutionised the accuracy of terrestrial weather prediction, but more importantly improved physical understanding of atmospheric processes.

With DARES, we will develop a HI-based DA scheme that will revolutionise our understanding of CME physics and improve space weather forecasting skill.

Working at the University of Reading, my team will collaborate with colleagues at the UK Met Office Space Weather Operations Center, UKRI's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and KU Leuven. By comparing our HI DA constrained CME simulations against observations of CMEs flowing past Earth, and state-of-the-art spacecraft observatories such as ESA's Solar Orbiter and NASA's Parker Solar Probe, we will discover the physics crucial for understanding CME evolution. In doing so, DARES will provide the critically needed knowledge and tools required improve space weather forecasting skill.

DARES is timely as it will help maximise the UK's return-on-investment from Vigil, the European Space Agency (ESA) space weather monitor to be launched in 2029. DARES also directly aligns with the UK National Space Strategy to ""protect and defend our national interests in"" space and ""lead pioneering scientific discovery"" as well as Pillar 1 of the UK Severe Space Weather Preparedness Strategy.",1197247,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Earth Sciences; Atmospheric Sciences; Astronomical Sciences
Collaborative Research: Cosmic Fizz - Constraining the CO x HI Cross Power Spectrum at the Epoch of Reionization,"The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) begins when the first luminous objects in the Universe form and their intense ultraviolet emission starts to reionize the neutral hydrogen of the intergalactic medium (IGM). With continued emission of ionizing radiation, reionization fronts form gradually expanding bubbles around the luminous sources. The growth of these ionized bubbles is patchy in both time and space, but the bubbles eventually merge and the EoR ends. Astronomers have yet to study the EoR through the most direct method: tracing the neutral IGM itself through detection of the redshifted 21 cm line. The CO Mapping Array Project is a Line Intensity Mapping experiment using a spectral line other than 21 cm. A collaborative project between California Institute of Technology, University of Miami, and University of Maryland will duplicate the existing Pathfinder receiver and use it to perform a survey of rhe carbon monoxide (CO) line across the sky. The research team will work with the Caltech Education Office to develop material to teach students in underserved high schools about coding and astronomy. During the summer, the project will provide training to teachers to deliver this material and will support the teachers with classroom visits during the school year. The field of 21 cm cosmology has the potential to probe the structure and evolution of the inter- galactic medium, from the Cosmic Dark Ages through to Cosmic Dawn, the Epoch of Reionization and beyond. There are many challenges to this work: a foreground-to-signal ratio spanning five orders of magnitude, strong radio frequency interference (RFI), and subtle instrumental systematic errors. The COMAP project expects to overcome these challenges. After the COMAP survey, the team will cross correlate the resulting CO temperature cube with observations of the same field by a 21 cm cosmology experiment, the Low Frequency Array. These experiments have very different systematic errors, RFI environments and foreground levels, and the planned cross-correlation will therefore be insensitive to these effects. The investigators forecast that the resulting constraint on the CO × HI power spectrum will be 30 times better than the best current limits on either CO or HI. This provides a path to the first unambiguous confirmation of the EoR-era 21 cm signal and a route to tighter constraints on the HI autocorrelation power spectrum alone.

Euclid Legacy Science Advanced analysis tools,"Euclid is an ESA space telescope launching in July 2023, designed to understand the nature of dark energy and dark matter. To achieve this, Euclid will observe over a third of the sky with high resolution imaging and spectroscopy, which will establish “the” reference map of the extra-galactic celestial sphere for decades to come. The giant archive produced will be a goldmine to study the history of the formation and growth of galaxies over the age of the Universe, driving answers to many fundamental science questions on the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, the interaction between stars, gas, and galactic nuclei in galaxies at cosmic noon, and excelling in the discovery of rare objects including gravitational lenses. However, the richest gold veins are also the most difficult to exploit: the tools developed for Euclid’s primary science will not be enough to open the rich legacy for the astronomical community. We therefore propose ELSA to explore new methodologies and create cutting-edge pipelines, tools and algorithms. Our ambitious goal is to push the boundaries of spectroscopic analysis to the limits, uncovering hidden details of even the faintest and rarest galaxies measured by Euclid. We will leverage state of the art machine learning to efficiently handle the high-dimensional data and reveal the underlying physical processes they encode. This will need dedicated computing resources and highly motivated researchers versed in the most advanced techniques, that will work with our team of leading experts in the field of galaxy evolution to reveal the treasures preserved in the Euclid vault. Our machine learning will be supplemented by citizen science, enormously extending the reach of ELSA’s impact. ELSA will be a forge of knowledge and advanced tools that will not be confined within the boundaries of our teams, but shared with the whole scientific community and beyond to foster new projects and unforeseen discoveries.",1165694,2024,2027,European Commission,Italy; France; Italy; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Revealing the drivers of galaxy formation in the densest cosmic environments,"One of the most perplexing aspects of our Universe is the huge variety of galaxy shapes and colours, from blue (star-forming) spiral discs to red (no longer star-forming) ellipticals. These differences are thought to be due to changing in- and outflows of gas (the ""baryon cycle""), a process that can be investigated particularly cleanly when galaxies fall towards densely inhabited cosmic environments such as galaxy clusters. But we do not understand well how and why these changes occur, especially in the early Universe and for low-mass ""dwarf"" galaxies, and which other processes might be important, especially tidal stripping of stars into the diffuse ""intra-cluster light"".

I will solve this problem by creating state-of-the-art defining computer simulations of galaxy clusters to interpret major new observations with ground- and space-based telescopes, including by the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope and with the new WEAVE spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope. Exploiting extensive development work by myself and others, these simulations will realistically model the star forming gas in cluster galaxies for the first time. Spanning the full range from small ""groups"" to the most massive observed clusters, they will also include close analogues of four well-studied clusters in the local Universe.

From these simulations, I will create synthetic observations, mimicking what they would look like in different wavelengths from X-rays through optical to radio. Comparing these with real observations, I will perform stringent tests of the simulation model and our understanding of galaxy formation encoded within it. In parallel, I will analyse the simulation outputs in detail, tracking individual galaxies through time to identify which physical processes emerge from the imposed laws of fundamental physics. In combination, these two approaches will solve the mystery of how galaxies form and evolve in the most extreme cosmic environments, and what they can tell us about the role of gas in- and outflows for galaxy formation in general.",1151100,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; Netherlands,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Coherent feedback control in optomechanics,"Quantum control techniques are the driving force behind the rapid advancement of quantum science and technology. Feedback is one of the most powerful and widely used control technique in the classical domain, but its application to quantum systems comes with significant challenges. In its standard implementation, feedback control involves a measurement, followed by electronic signal processing and feedback actuation. When applied to quantum systems, however, the measurement not only provides information about the system but also irreversibly disturbs its state. A different kind of feedback is possible: coherent feedback of quantum signals, without intervening measurements and thus circumventing the decoherence and backaction noise associated with them. Coherent feedback has the potential to improve quantum control and provide new capabilities in quantum technology across a broad range of physical systems. However, experiments on coherent feedback are scarce and many open questions remain regarding its performance, limitations, and applications. In this project, we will experimentally explore coherent feedback control in optomechanics and evaluate its performance for different tasks in quantum technology. Optomechanical systems seem predestined for investigations of coherent feedback control: they offer a clean and tailored interface between highly coherent mechanical and electromagnetic field modes and they find numerous applications as quantum sensors and transducers that can benefit from improved quantum control. We will set up a membrane cavity optomechanical system operating deep in the quantum regime and providing a highly efficient and fast interface to free-space optical fields. With this system, we will implement a range of conceptually new optical coherent feedback loops that realize different quantum control tasks, such as ground-state cooling of the membrane, mechanical squeezing, time-dependent Hamiltonian engineering, and the generation of optomechanical nonlinearities. Moreover, we will interface the optomechanical system with an atomic spin ensemble that will act as coherent feedback controller for the membrane. Exploiting the sophisticated toolbox for quantum control of the atomic spins, we will explore the generation of Hamiltonian and dissipative interactions as well as the generation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement of atoms and membrane, with a focus on potential applications in quantum metrology.The applicant's group recently reported the first proof-of-principle demonstrations of coherent feedback cooling in optomechanics, using either a purely optical feedback loop or a hybrid mechanical-atomic system. This project builds on these achievements and takes them a decisive step further, by entering the quantum noise limited regime and exploring coherent feedback control tasks beyond cooling. It will lead to novel insights into the performance and limitations of different coherent feedback strategies as well as their applications in quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and metrology. As the concepts involved are rather general, we expect the results of the project to be of relevance for a variety of systems, including optomechanics, atomic ensembles, solid-state emitters, and superconducting circuits.",1110176,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics

Probing the Higgs potential with tau-leptons and b-quarks and extended pixel tracker at CMS,"The groundbreaking discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 achieved by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations represents a significant milestone in particle physics, affirming the Standard Model (SM) predictions. The Higgs boson is intricately connected to the Higgs scalar field, which permeates the Universe and played a pivotal role in the early moments after the Big Bang, influencing Electroweak Symmetry-Breaking (EWSB) processes that led to the formation of matter as we know it.Validating the existence of the Higgs boson confirms the presence of the Higgs scalar field,  which is postulated somewhat arbitrarily within the SM. A decade of meticulous measurements has reinforced the notion that the properties of the Higgs boson align with the predictions of the SM. However, the structure and shape of the Higgs field, upon which the EWSB mechanism relies, remain untested experimentally.Measuring the Higgs boson self-coupling is a model-independent test of the SM, essential for experimentally probing the shape of the scalar potential at the core of the EWSB mechanism. The most sensitive method to measure the Higgs boson self-coupling is through the rate and kinematics of double Higgs boson (“di-Higgs”) production. However, its production cross-section is significantly smaller than that of a single Higgs boson, requiring sustained and comprehensive efforts to achieve such a measurement. Additionally, exploring di-Higgs production offers stringent tests of the Higgs boson's couplings to other quantum fields, potentially revealing new physics via anomalous interactions.Despite operating for over a decade, the LHC has only collected a small fraction of its anticipated data. Yet, it has already opened new avenues of exploration, refined our questions, and advanced our analytical methods.The work in this proposal will deepen our understanding of the scalar sector and investigate the dynamics of EWSB by exploring di-Higgs production. Focusing on enhancing sensitivity to di-Higgs production in the bbtt channel, which is among the most discriminating channels, it aims to improve our knowledge of the origins of particle masses. Utilizing Effective-Field Theory (EFT) frameworks, it seeks to probe beyond the SM effects that could impact the interactions of the Higgs boson with other particles. Introducing an extended Higgs sector can address several theoretical challenges encountered in the SM, particularly by postulating the existence of particles capable of decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons. This work will significantly extend the reach of searches for heavy particles by searching for new resonances in X->HH?bbtt. The overreaching goal of this proposal is to advance the next generation of HH->bbtt analyses through robust triggers, advanced object identification methods, state-of-the-art analysis techniques, and optimal tools for result interpretation.By the conclusion of 2025, the LHC will have generated over 300 fb-1 of integrated luminosity. In 2029, the HL-LHC program will start to achieve 3000 fb-1 of integrated luminosity by approximately 2040. To maximize the discovery potential of the CMS experiment, the UZH group is actively engaged in the design, prototyping, and construction of the new phase-II pixel detector. This innovative detector, known as the TEPX, extends tracking capabilities into the forward region, reaching a pseudo-rapidity up to 4. Such enhancements in tracking range will significantly improve identification for vector boson fusion processes, enhance missing energy resolution, and mitigate pileup effects for CMS analyses. Part of this proposal is dedicated to the validation and preparation for the construction phase of TEPX, further amplifying the research capabilities of the CMS experiment.",1090983,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Tunable electronic structure of exfoliated 2D crystals,"This proposal builds on the vibrant research into two-dimensional (2D) materials, stimulated by the rapid increase in the number of compounds that can be exfoliated into monolayers (MLs) and the remarkable technical advances enabling their controlled stacking (sequence and twist angle) into tailor-made heterostructures often with unique physical properties distinct from those of their bulk counterparts. Its overarching theme is the characterization of correlated electronic phases in 2D exfoliated materials as a function of field-effect doping, as a function of thickness (i.e. number of layers), and as a function of strain by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Taking full advantage of the immense possibilities offered by 2D exfoliated materials and their heterostructures depends on the detailed knowledge of the properties of exfoliated layers. The aim of this proposal is to deploy new capabilities in STM and STS to characterize exfoliated 2D materials and their devices in ultra-high vacuum. We propose to implement new experimental capabilities to deploy tunable strain and carrier concentration, two very valuable additions to the more traditional temperature and magnetic field variables. We will apply a new scheme to apply a uniform, adjustable biaxial tensile strain to thin exfoliated 2D materials. We also propose to study exfoliated MLs on ionic glasses compatible with STM. This will bring ionic liquid gating, which allows to reach unprecedented carrier doping concentrations up to 10^15/cm^2, into the realm of scanning probes, which require a free, pristine surface that is not available with ionic liquid gating.In the first phase of the project, we will validate the new experimental capabilities mentioned above on 2D materials with which we are very familiar. The strain device will be validated by studying the response to strain of the CDW in 1T-TiSe2 and GdTe3. Field effect doping using ionic glasses will be validated by measuring the semiconductor to metal transition coupled with the appearance of a CDW in 1T-ZrSe2. We have preliminary results demonstrating the feasibility of all these experiments.In the second phase, these capabilities will be applied to topical issues in 2D materials and their heterostructures. We will focus on electronic phases for which STM and STS are particularly well suited, such as superconductivity, CDW, magnetic and topological phases. The high spectroscopic (in direct and reciprocal space) and spatial resolutions of STM combined with tuneable doping and strain will provide unique insights into these fundamental electronic states, into atomic defects and spatial inhomogeneities, as well as into the competition or cooperation of quantum phases. These experiments will contribute to the fundamental understanding of exfoliated 2D materials and provide feedback for understanding results obtained with spatially averaging techniques. We will focus on individual flakes to gain direct insight into how the physical properties of selected materials evolve as they approach the 2D limit, as well as on proximity- and gate-induced superconductivity, CDWs and magnetic phases in the thinnest crystals and in heterostructures. Combining these scanning probe experiments with other techniques, such as transport experiments and ARPES, will provide a comprehensive data set for understanding the rich physics emerging in 2D materials.",1070895,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics

The discovery of the skyrmion lattice has underscored the significance of topology in magnetism. Here we propose a major new initiative to search for topologically nontrivial features in magnetic arrangements and magnon spectra of correlated electron systems. We shall combine our expertise in the symmetry, electronic structure and physical properties of materials. Our research methodology will involve the usage of neutron diffraction and spectroscopy on single crystals as our primary experimental tools for studying the topological behavior in both direct and reciprocal spaces. The outcomes of our project will contribute to advancing the current understanding of magnetic topology and can lead to the development of novel spintronic devices with improved functionalities.",1069039,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Algebraic cycles on moduli spaces: correspondences and structures,"Algebraic geometry is the study of varieties -- the zero sets of polynomial equations in several variables. The subject has a central role in mathematics with connections to number theory, representation theory, and topology. Moduli questions in algebraic geometry concern the behavior of varieties as the coefficients of the defining polynomials vary. At the end of the 20th century, several fundamental links between the algebraic geometry of moduli spaces and path integrals in quantum field theory were made. In Gromov-Witten theory, the integrals are interpreted as intersection pairings on moduli spaces of stable maps. In Donaldson-Thomas theory, the integrals arise as intersection parings on moduli spaces of sheaves.I propose here to study the geometry of fundamental algebraic moduli spaces: curves, sheaves, abelian varieties, and K3 surfaces. The main directions concern cohomology rings, algebraic cycle theory (especially the theory of tautological classes), logarithmic cycles, and the naturally associated generating series of integrals. My perspective is to use deep connections and correspondences between these moduli spaces to prove new results and to find new structures. The basic connections are the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence (between curve and sheaf moduli), the Gromov-Witten/Noether-Lefschetz correspondence (between curve and K3 moduli), and the Torelli map (between curve and abelian variety moduli). In addition, there are fundamental parallels between the geometry of the moduli spaces of abelian varieties and K3 surfaces which will be exploited.The GW/DT correspondence relates the geometry of stable maps of curves to a 3-fold X to the geometry of the moduli spaces of sheaves on X. Virasoro constraints can be moved from Gromov-Witten theory to Donaldson-Thomas theory. I propose to study the Virasoro constraints for the stable pairs theory of 3-folds using both descendent correspondences and wall-crossing techniques for sheaves.The moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian varieties carry Noether-Lefschetz cycles of virtual codimension given by the socle of the tautological ring. I propose to compute the proportionalities of the virtual Noether-Lefschetz cycles and to study the relationship of the actual Noether-Lefschetz cycles to tautological ring. The main new method here is pull-back via the Torelli map (a tool which has recently been made effective by Pixton's relations). For K3 moduli spaces, I propose to calculate the full Chow rings in low degree cases and to prove the socle conjectures in the tautological ring.I propose to study two main topics in the geometry of line bundles on curves: the structure of the logarithmic double ramification cycle and the classification of Picard cohomological field theories.These are new directions connected to recent progress in the study of the cohomology of both the moduli of curves and the associated universal moduli of line bundles.",1066303,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Control of Instabilities in Rotating flows Conducting Electricity: dynamo seeds and subcritical transition to MHD turbulence in stellar objects.,"Modeling magnetic field generation by dynamo instability in stellar objects is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching implications for stellar evolution theory. Underlying motivations are exemplified by the need to understand stellar spin-down and accretion rates in protostellar discs, which are known to be dynamically impacted by magnetic fields. The interest sparked by recurring discrepancies between predictive evolution models and rapidly-progressing observations drives the current research into the characterization of dynamo mechanisms in stellar objects.
This important challenge cannot be solved analytically due to the strong nonlinearities of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. Solving it therefore requires the development of innovative numerical approaches. In many astrophysical flows, infinitesimal magnetic seeds cannot be amplified by the flow, whereas finite-amplitude magnetic seeds with a favourable spatial structure can drive, through the Lorentz force nonlinear feedback, the very flow motions on which they subsequently feed by subcritical dynamo instability. This situation is particularly relevant for radiative stellar layers or for the innermost regions of protostellar discs, where the history of perturbations can thus define the magnetic fate of the object. Yet, classical stability methods fail to systematically characterize subcritical dynamo solutions and identify their critical dynamo seeds. The CIRCE project will tackle this theoretical obstacle by developing the recent mathematical tools of nonlinear stability analysis, based on adjoint-based optimal control, for MHD flows. The aim of CIRCE is to identify the least-energy perturbations that can trigger subcritical dynamos and transition to MHD turbulence in models of (a) radiative zones and (b) protostellar discs, and to predict how the resulting transitions determine rotational dynamics and accretion rates.",1053109,2024,2028,ERC,France,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Low-Background Nuclear Astrophysics Studies a Mile Underground,"Particle interactions of importance to nuclear astrophysics are the priority of the CASPAR (Compact Accelerator System for Performing Astrophysical Research) research instruments. CASPAR is the first and only deep underground accelerator laboratory in the United States and only the third existing in the world. It is located nearly a mile underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. This award will support researchers using gamma and particle detection techniques, to focus on the study of the early stages of light elemental synthesis in primordial stars (the first stars formed after the Big Bang). The nuclear interactions involving light elements in stellar environments are the foundation for the production of all elements in the Universe. This work will provide data to explain the abundance of elements that are observed by astronomers in the oldest stars of our Universe. Additional investigations will study the source of neutrons that drive these processes and will provide a more complete picture of the nuclear burning in stars that facilitates the production of the heavier elements. Understanding these processes is crucial for our understanding of multi-messenger astrophysical sources and thus addresses goals of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. Laboratory studies of nucleosynthesis in stars are difficult to perform near the surface of the earth due to an enormous background from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere that overwhelm the experiment. Therefore, this work will utilize a 1 Mega Volt electrostatic accelerator located 4850 ft underground at SURF to perform experiments that exploit the low cosmic ray background conditions at CASPAR. The acceleration and subsequent bombardment of a range of elements of interest (for example boron and neon) with proton and alpha ion beams, will result in the emission of neutrons and gamma rays to be analyzed with Sodium Iodide (NaI) summing detectors and deuterated liquid scintillator arrays. The facility is nearly unique in the world. It is comparable to the LUNA facility in Italy and JUNA in China. CASPAR is a collaboration between the nuclear astrophysics programs at the University of Notre Dame and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.

Unconventional superconductivity in van der Waals superconductor/magnet heterostructures,"I propose to investigate unconventional superconductivity in van der Waals (vdW) superconductor/magnet (SC/M) heterostructures. Unconventional superconductivity is one of the most attractive topics in modern condensed matter physics because its novel physics poses many open questions and because of possible future applications. One of the promising ways to generate unconventional superconductivity is by fabricating high-quality SC/M heterostructures to control the spin and pairing symmetry of the superconducting state. The discovery of vdW materials and progress in vdW stacking techniques disclose a new route to reach this aim, by combining vdW materials that are intrinsic superconductors and magnets. High-quality heterostructures built with these newly discovered materials allow proximity effects to be realized within nanometer distance in SC/M heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and perfectly defined crystal structures. The project that I am proposing aims at fabricating vdW SC/M heterostructures, to generate and probe exotic properties of unconventional superconductivity. The key goal is engineering spin-triplet and topological superconductivity. To this end, superconducting proximity effect will be realized and detected in multilayer superconductor/ferromagnet heterostructures. A second way is inducing superconductivity in newly found vdW magnetic materials with exotic magnetic structures. For each of these routes, I will carefully choose vdW magnets with specific properties. Some of the materials and heterostructures that I will use are extremely difficult or even impossible to realize with traditional material growth techniques. The unconventional superconducting states will be characterized by performing experiments on specifically designed electronic devices based on vdW staking techniques, such as tunnelling junctions, phase controllable superconducting quantum interference devices, and by scanning tunnelling microscopy. My research background in unconventional 2D superconductors and vdW heterostructures is ideally suited to carry out this project and will give me a head start. The research will be conducted in close collaboration with Prof. Alberto Morpurgo Group in Department of Quantum Matter Physics (DQMP) at University of Geneva. Prof. Morpurgo is one of the top-level scientists in the study of 2D materials, especially in 2D superconductors and magnetic materials. His laboratory is equipped with the facilities that are necessary for my research. In his group, I will gain knowledge of 2D superconductors, 2D magnets and device fabrication, which are important to the success of this project. Part of the research related to scanning tunnelling microscopy will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. Christoph Renner Group in the same department. The collaboration with Prof. Fabian O. von Rohr will provide me with high-quality crystals for building heterostructures. The supportive environment in DQMP will inspire more creative ideas to reach the goals of this proposal. During different phases of the research, I will contact different groups, which are pioneering in the investigation of SC/M heterostructures built by traditional material growth techniques, for collaboration in the theoretical calculation, characterization under special conditions, etc. This project will enhance my skills in carrying out research independently and will allow me to build up a highly attractive profile. Therefore, it will offer me excellent opportunities to search for positions in high-level institutions in Switzerland and other parts of the world to continue my scientific career.",1048398,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Interfacing Integrated Photonics for Quantum Repeaters,"Quantum communication is expected to be a crucial component of future quantum technologies, enabling the transfer of information from one location to another with unprecedented security compared to current classical protocols [1]. In addition, the rapid development of quantum computation and quantum simulation technologies will soon require a reliable and robust quantum network in order to distribute quantum information. Such a network should also allow interfacing between the different technologies and platforms which may be used for these systems, such as trapped ions [2], photons [3], and optical lattices [4]. A key component of quantum communication is the distribution of entanglement through networks, however this comes with several challenges. Direct transmission of quantum information between two nodes via a standard fibre link is unfeasible for transmission distances of more than a few hundreds of kilometres, due to the loss of photons as they propagate through the fibres [5]. As an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned [6], standard amplification techniques as used in classical communication systems cannot be used to overcome this loss. An alternative to direct quantum information distribution is the ‘quantum repeater’ architecture, which transmits information between two nodes via an intermediate repeater node [7]. Current implementations of quantum repeater protocols involve the use of large, bulk optic photon sources which typically require nearly an entire optical table to operate [8]. Such large sources are clearly impractical when moving towards a realistically implementable and scalable quantum network, where the goal is to be as compact and stable as possible. Integrated photonics is a promising solution to this problem, allowing large numbers of components to be packaged together in a compact manner [3]. It has already demonstrated widespread application in classical technologies, as well as showing early success in miniaturising what were previously large, bulk optic experiments such as many-ion quantum logic [9].The aim of this research proposal is to build a key element in order to implement an entanglement-based quantum repeater scheme; namely an integrated photon source. Practically, this will involve using an integrated micro-ring resonator (MRR) based on a silicon nitride (SiN) platform as a photon source [10,11], which will subsequently be interfaced with a rare-earth-ion quantum memory [12]. Integrated MRRs have already demonstrated excellent performance as photon sources [10]. They are compact and highly stable and, importantly, their heralding efficiencies have been shown as comparable to some bulk optic sources [11]. As such, MRRs show great promise as the basis for future large-scale quantum networks. The MRRs which will be used in this project will be fabricated in a collaboration with the Kippenberg Group at EPFL. We will work together on the optimisation and fabrication of suitable chips for this project. To implement the repeater-like structure, the photon source will then be interfaced with a quantum memory. The Quantum Memories group of Mikael Afzelius, also at the University of Geneva, have quantum memories which have already demonstrated the capacity for long storage times with high multimode capacity and bandwidth [12]. As such, this project will bring together three key research groups to implement quantum repeater-like architectures.In the main objective of this proposal, two MRRs will be used to generate photons at 980nm and 1550nm. By storing a photon at 980nm in a quantum memory and interfering the photons at 1550nm, entanglement swapping can be implemented. Readout of the stored photon from the quantum memory will allow a fidelity measurement of the entanglement-swapping scheme. Previous experiments have already shown the ability of MRRs to successfully implement high-fidelity entanglement swapping [10,11]. However, this research proposal will move beyond such experiments due to the challenges which must be overcome in interfacing MRRs with a quantum memory. The quantum memory places very stringent requirements on the bandwidth and stability of the photons, as well as requiring generation of photons at 980nm. Successfully overcoming these challenges means this proposal will make a significant step towards the realistic implementation of a repeater network.An additional benefit to working with SiN MRRs is their potential use in quantum frequency conversion (QFC). The capability for QFC is important when moving to a distributed entanglement network, especially one with multiple different platforms. SiN MRRs have already demonstrated great promise with frequency conversion, including up- and down-conversion between 980nm and 1550nm with over 60% efficiency [13]. Our MRRs will already be suited to frequency conversion, and so a side project will test their capacity for QFC with single photon Fock states. A successful demonstration of QFC will potentially lead to its integration with our quantum repeater entanglement-swapping architecture.The outcome of this proposal will be several different tools demonstrating the utility of these SiN MRRs in quantum communication; essentially comprising a ‘photonic toolbox’. The implementation of the quantum-repeater entanglement-swapping protocol will naturally demonstrate the capability for these MRRs to provide multiple, important elements for future quantum networks. This includes their frequency tunability, generation of photons at very different frequencies, and quantum frequency conversion. Such devices have the future potential to miniaturise what are currently large, bulk-optic experiments into rack-mountable photon sources and systems.[1] M.

Low Energy Particle Physics with Cold and Ultracold Neutrons II,"With this SNSF grant application, I propose to perform a unique and coherent research program in the field of low energy particle physics using slow neutrons. The presented program is divided into three challenging sub-projects which have the potential of substantial scientific implications and discoveries. Sub-projects one and two (SP1 and SP2) concern the measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM). SP1 is focused on research carried out with the upcoming n2EDM experiment within the nEDM-collaboration. Here, we will commission, test, optimize, take, and analyse first physics data with the essential center piece of the experimental apparatus, namely the high-voltage precession chamber developed in Bern. In SP2 we continue a novel and complementary approach to search for a neutron EDM using a pulsed neutron beam, which is ultimately intended for the future European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden. And sub-project three (SP3) comprises the development of a high-sensitivity cold neutron interferometer which will be used to measure the electric charge of the neutron. The project grant will enable us to explore novel opportunities in fundamental precision physics and search for potential new physics beyond the current Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. My group at the University of Bern will be the major driving force in all sub-projects and will be involved in all technical and scientific aspects. The research will be mainly carried out in our laboratories in Bern, where all preparations for the neutron experiments as well as complementing physics experiments will be performed. In addition, we will conduct experiments at national and international neutron research facilities, namely at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland and the Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL) in France.",1028944,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
CAREER: Towards realistic halo-scale constraints on the nature of dark matter and gravity,"The nature of dark matter (DM) and gravity are among the foremost unsolved problems in astrophysics. To distinguish between the possible solutions, astrophysicists compare the observed distribution of galaxies to supercomputer simulations, which follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in “fake” Universes with different DM and gravity models. This team of investigators will create an ambitious simulation suite that uniformly covers an unprecedented range of DM and gravity models. The simulations will be publicly available and will enable detailed comparisons to observational surveys that are expected to release data during the 5-year lifetime of this award, potentially ruling out certain models of DM and gravity. This project will also support the mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, as well as an exploration of novel tools such as 3D printing to teach cosmology to a wide range of learners. Enormous effort has been devoted to finding observable imprints of different DM and gravity models, but the work of different groups is most often impossible to inter-compare because they rely on different cosmological parameters, galaxy formation physics, simulation codes, and analysis tools. As a result, it is still unclear which model signatures are robust and which are degenerate with those of other models, cosmology, or poorly understood feedback processes. This project represents a systematic approach to searching for unique observable signatures on small scales, focusing on the density structure of (sub-)halos, the outskirts of galaxy clusters, and the distribution of satellite galaxies. The resulting simulation suite will be unique in its uniformity, its breadth of models, and its mass range from dwarf galaxies to clusters. The publicly available simulations will enable countless community projects. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1019592,2024,2029,NSF,United States,United States,Particle and High Energy Physics

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Deep Learning on Programmable Quantum Computers (DLPQC),"A central challenge of our time is demonstrating a practical quantum advantage for problems relevant to science and engineering. To address this challenge, the team envisions building an advanced quantum computing laboratory that enables external users to propose and demonstrate quantum information science and engineering (QISE) advances that map these problems to many-body quantum states in neutral atoms. By building a robust infrastructure to create and fault-tolerantly measure quantum many-body states, quantum advantage may be realized across problems in chemistry, materials, and physics, discovering fundamental truths inaccessible with existing classical techniques. The program will simultaneously advance critical hardware, software, and architecture for general-purpose quantum computing as well as other quantum technologies including quantum networks and sensing. This project will make significant advances in atomic physics, quantum error correction, and quantum compilation to meet the requirements of the logical quantum processing unit (LQU) and the analog quantum simulator (AQU), which represent capabilities far beyond the state-of-the-art for any quantum science platform. The project will also develop next-generation integrated electronics and photonics to control large-scale quantum systems at high speeds. These technologies will benefit all quantum science platforms as well as applications limited by today’s optical devices, such as LiDAR and optical networking. Our approach capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in programmable quantum simulators and neutral atom computing to develop an open quantum testbed. This consists of an error-corrected digital quantum processing unit (LQU) with over 100 fault-tolerant logical qubits connected to an analog quantum simulator (AQU) comprising over 1000 physical qubits, and teleportation-based interfaces for loading arbitrary quantum states into the AQU from external devices. By making the quantum computer broadly accessible, the project will enable many research teams to test their algorithms and hardware, overcoming existing barriers to developing or acquiring cutting-edge quantum technology: large capital, labor investments and domain expertise in multiple fields. This NQVL quantum science and technology demonstrator project (QSTD) will democratize access and enable a greater than 10-fold increase in quantum builders and users by 2030 through hardware models (""digital twins""), open-source software, end-to-end system engineering, shared facilities for validation and benchmarking, and community engagement. This interdisciplinary initiative will advance multiple academic fields, enable new hardware innovations and practical quantum advantages through modular software and architecture prototypes. Key beneficiaries are quantum hardware and software developers who will gain access to a centralized infrastructure for component testing and executing quantum algorithms.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Accelerating Fault-Tolerant Quantum Logic (FTL),"The ability of quantum hardware to outperform classical hardware for tasks like computation, communication, and sensing is known as quantum advantage. Quantum advantage promises society-changing benefits including fundamentally secure communication, improved biomedical sensing, and breakthroughs in material and drug design. To date, useful quantum advantage for computation has not been realized. Though there is reason to be optimistic for near term advances, it is widely accepted that useful quantum advantage in computing will require fault tolerance at scale -- an advance that is still beyond the reach of current devices. This project is aiming to accelerate the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation by co-designing error correcting codes and the hardware that will run them. Currently, many quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes have been discovered, and their mathematical structures are becoming better understood. Meanwhile, hardware with a few logical qubits has been demonstrated and, in some cases, a small gain in process fidelity realized. However, the demands on hardware for current QEC codes are severe -- either enormous numbers of qubits are required or native gate fidelities must be extremely high (often, both). By designing QEC codes to utilize the native gates and connectivity of the hardware, while simultaneously optimizing the hardware layout to support the QEC code, fault tolerance can be achieved with the minimum resource cost thereby delivering useful quantum advantage sooner. Of the existing hardware platforms, the trapped-ion QCCD architecture shows a special promise to achieve fault tolerance, especially in view of the recent progress where key problems such as qubit shuttling and wiring have been solved. Further, it currently provides the highest state preparation, measurement, and gate fidelities, and has led to commercial systems with the highest quantum volume. It also natively provides mid-circuit measurement with minimal cross-talk error and has a well understood error model. Finally, it provides all-to-all qubit connectivity. These features are likely to be necessary requirements for realizing fault tolerance in the near term. To accelerate progress in fault-tolerant quantum computing, an interdisciplinary team composed of computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and educators focuses on the identification of the most efficient QEC codes for the hardware and the optimization of their deployment on the QCCD system. Further, they research how to improve gate fidelities while working closely with commercial vendors to realize the assembly of such a fault-tolerant QCCD system. Finally, the team convenes a community of educators, industry and government leaders to chart the optimum route for meeting the workforce needs of the field. This project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Attosecond Synchronized Photonic Entanglement Network (ASPEN-Net),"Quantum information science and technology provides tools that can significantly impact nearly all activities in modern society. Quantum sensors currently allow the most precise measurements possible enabling new discoveries in science and engineering. Quantum computers promise to perform calculations beyond the capacity of any classical device, enabling advances in diverse fields such as medicine, chemistry, manufacturing and security. Quantum networks, which distribute fragile quantum entanglement between multiple parties, permeate the entire quantum technology environment and enable new modalities of both quantum sensing and computation, as well as novel communications capabilities that allow secure communications with no classical analog. This project is developing the Attosecond Synchronized Photonic Entanglement Network (ASPEN-Net), a scalable quantum networking platform capable of distributing entanglement at high rates and over large distances. Three separate interoperable quantum networking testbeds, located in Colorado, Illinois and Oregon, focus on delivering a quantum advantage in sensing and communications applications, while providing user access to the quantum network. To increase the quantum workforce, the project provides a range of on-ramp, training opportunities for pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students and post-graduate training activities. Equitable access to education and workforce development activities is made possible for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups underrepresented in the quantum workforce. Realizing ASPEN-Net requires technical development of the key compatible network components: hardware (high-rate, high-quality single-photon sources; phase-stable all-optical quantum memories; efficient photon-counting detectors; and active, attosecond-level synchronization between network nodes), software (network management and feedback control systems), and interfaces for both physical and remote users. The project has four major areas of scientific research activities required to deliver the full network stack from hardware to control software. 1) Hardware development is focused on the co-design of the core components for the network to deliver the entanglement needs for specific applications. 2) System integration is focused on ensuring interoperability of network devices allowing for scalable and reconfigurable network architecture. 3) Network interfacing, control and error correction develops network-level control and reliability, including application programming interfaces for research and education. 4) Quantum advantage demonstrators experimentally establish enhanced performance of quantum sensing and communications tasks utilizing ASPEN-Net.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Distributed-Entanglement Quantum Sensing of Chemical Properties (DQS-CP),"The emergence of practical applications for quantum information is being hailed as the second quantum revolution due to its potential to transform applications in computing, communications, and sensing. At the root of this revolution is the ability to harness the property of quantum entanglement between two or more quantum systems, or qubits, to push performance beyond the single-state quantum limit. This quantum testbed will work to realize this performance for solid-state quantum sensors capable of measuring molecular structure and dynamics at the single molecule level, validating quantum advantage in applications ranging from materials characterization, to catalysis, to drug discovery. The testbed will coordinate between the quantum creator and end user communities to develop a roadmap to quantum advantage, aligning research activity with critical needs in science and industry. Students participating in the testbed will be mentored within a highly interdisciplinary and convergent environment. The emerging roadmap will be used to inform the development and dissemination of curricular material that will lay the foundation for training the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers in partnership with the QuSTEAM Initiative. Specifically, the testbed is developing a platform for exploiting the entanglement of multi-qubit ensembles to achieve quantum advantage in the measurement of molecular and solid-state systems, including structural, electronic, and dynamic degrees of freedom. This platform allows for the modular deconstruction of the quantum sensor into three fundamental units: (1) a set of molecular targets, (2) a spin-relay layer that directly couples to both the target and readout, and (3) a readout qubit. The power of this modular approach can be seen in the fact that the spin-relay layer can be selectively driven into a metrologically relevant entangled state to enable sensing beyond the standard quantum limit (i.e., sensitivity scaling that surpasses sqrtN). Further, this modularity provides a framework for structuring collaboration and co-design between stakeholders including end users, system manufacturers and quantum researchers across academia, government, and industry. This project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Erasure Qubits and Dynamic Circuits for Quantum Advantage (ERASE),"Quantum computers have the potential to create a revolutionary form of information processing, however current hardware is very prone to errors. A grand challenge is to learn how to correct these errors so that one can build large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. This ERASE project will address this challenge by developing an innovative quantum computing platform based on ‘erasure flag’ qubits that herald when and where errors occur. Erasure flag information will make it easier to correct the errors and achieve fault tolerance. Researchers will have access to advanced tools for developing new algorithms and improving software systems, as well as the opportunity to experiment with quantum error correction and create new quantum algorithms that use mid-circuit measurements and program branching (decision making) based on the measurement results. ERASE is a collaboration between academia and an industrial hardware partner, Quantum Circuits, Inc. (QCI), to drive research towards practical quantum information technologies. ERASE will promote educational initiatives to cultivate a skilled quantum workforce, in partnership with historically black colleges and universities. The aim is to build a vibrant national ecosystem for quantum research, paving the way toward achieving quantum advantage in computation and simulation. Our goal is to deploy novel high performance superconducting hardware whose logical qubit states are defined by a single microwave photon shared between two long-lived resonators. This dual-resonator (‘dual-rail’) logical encoding can detect the dominant error (photon loss) converting leakage out of the code space into a flagged erasure error. Concatenating this dual-rail error detection code into a larger code will allow efficient correction of the dominant errors since their locations are flagged. Because our proposed architecture has unique hardware characteristics, it will enable new types of algorithms and require a rethinking of the systems software toolflow. The ERASE team will form a national community of researchers in applications/algorithms, software, and systems architecture to develop a National Quantum Virtual Laboratory in collaboration with our hardware partner, QCI. QCI will provide researchers with access to this new computational paradigm through an Application Programming Interface (API) into multiple levels of the system stack to: (1) develop and execute new algorithms designed for the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of our novel superconducting quantum computing testbed; (2) contribute to improved middleware design (e.g., error-aware compilers; efficient control flow for mid-circuit measurements and feedforward) ); (3) co-design of improvements in error correction protocols.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Quantum Blueprint: Optimizing Analog Pathways in Diverse Scientific Realms (Q-BLUE),"The Q-BLUE project will support a three-pronged effort to significantly advance quantum computing: (1) analog quantum hardware development, (2) an optimized compilation process, and (3) advances in three applications – quantum chemistry (QC), condensed matter physics (CMP) and nuclear physics (NP). Each of these applications will reap significant benefits from quantum computing. In quantum chermistry time-dependent quantum simulations will enable the exploration of complex molecular dynamics, ushering in a revolution in drug discovery and material design. In nuclear physics, a wealth of unprecedented insights into the behavior of exotic nuclei emerges, with direct implications for nuclear energy and astrophysics, will be obtained. In condensed matter physics, the inner workings of quantum many-body systems will be revealed, potentially paving the way for the creation of groundbreaking materials. The Q-BLUE project will bolster partnerships and cultivate a skilled workforce, particularly excelling in education for both graduates and undergraduates. Nurturing a proficient software engineering workforce plays a pivotal role in advancing the field of quantum computation. The project will actively involve students in research initiatives alongside engineers specializing in the development of trapped-ion quantum computers. This comprehensive educational strategy ensures that our graduates are exceptionally well-prepared to contribute to academic research and industrial applications within the field of quantum computing. Time-dependent simulations on analog Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum computers hold considerable importance in chemistry, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics. Such simulations do not merely provide glimpses into the dynamic behavior of quantum systems but also have the potential to showcase “quantum advantage”; i.e. the ability to solve complex problems exponentially faster or to address computational challenges that are infeasible for classical computers to tackle within a reasonable time. The potential of quantum computing to redefine such applications arises from its inherent capacity to manage the exponential complexities inherent in quantum systems, thereby forging new pathways for scientific discovery and technological advancement, pathways that were once considered unattainable. While the digital approach has proven its universality, the quantum analog mode offers a key advantage by being less susceptible to errors. In the 9th month of our project, the Q-BLUE team will organize a Town Hall, conducted virtually to maximize participation, including by under-represented groups.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Quantum Computing Applications of Photonics (QCAP),"Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) promises to accelerate information processing far beyond classical limits, enabled by the differences in the foundamental natural laws of classical and quantum physics. Currently, state-of-the-art quantum devices are noisy, lack full error correction and fault tolerance, are limited to small prototype devices, and require very low operation temperatures for utilizing quantum effects and fragile quantum states. In that broader landscape, this program rests on a strategy for quantum computing using photonic components that can operate at room temperature. Quantum computing in general is expected to impact areas such as economic forecasting, high-precision climate change modeling, drug discovery, quantum chemistry, and discovery of novel technological materials. The technical activities under this project are accompanied by the economic/technology risk assessment that assists in prioritizing project tasks/risk mitigation and identifies techno-economic directions and opportunities for forging meaningful and lasting strategic economic and industrial partnerships. Academic partners participating in this project are minority-serving institutions, supporting learning communities for increasing equity, inclusiveness, and quantum workforce diversity, consistent with demographic goals of the National Quantum Initiative. A major technical goal of this project is to design a blueprint for building a full-stack programmable photonic Gaussian-boson-sampling (GBS) quantum computer, including hardware selection for quantum light sources (input), interferometer units (compute), and photo-detection (output), as well as algorithm development for the GBS quantum computing platform. The long-term goal for realizing fully error-corrected, scalable, fault-tolerant quantum advantage is assisted by a synergistic hybrid quantum-classical capability for increased programming versatility of the interferometer compute unit. Transformative high-impact use-cases realized with a photonic quantum computer are expected for problems with high-dimensional solution spaces. The goal of developing a full-stack GBS quantum information processing system is bound to advance many aspects of quantum photonics. New and better controllable quantum light sources are imperative for GBS, but are also critical for advancing quantum communication and quantum networking, a prerequisite for distributed quantum computing. The educational goals are to develop new teaching modules to facilitate adoption and adaptation at various educational levels into existing curricula, raising quantum awareness and literacy at 2-year and 4-year colleges, and increasing students' readiness for continued education in the graduate quantum science and engineering degree programs to be developed at the University of New Mexico, the lead institution.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Quantum Photonic Integration and Deployment (QuPID),"Spectroscopic quantum metrologies—the science of using quantum light–matter interactions for measurements—stand at the cutting edge of advancements in high-precision standards, techniques, and applications. Despite representing some of the highest achievements in spectroscopy to date, quantum metrologies have largely remained confined to laboratory settings, leaving their greatest potential––applications outside laboratories––mostly untapped. Following the NSF’s mission to realize practical quantum advantages, the QuPID team, led by the University of Michigan with members from Stanford University, Harvard University, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, University of Arizona, University of Southern California, industry leaders, and national laboratories, is working to remove these barriers. This team is developing groundbreaking chips designed to bring spectroscopic quantum metrologies out of laboratory confines and into the real world while surpassing traditional limits on precision, speed, and efficiency. The resulting scalable technology promises to revolutionize critical industries, ranging from microelectronics and space exploration to healthcare and beyond. These user-friendly, chip-based instruments also streamline education and ignite the imagination of future STEM enthusiasts. By making high-precision quantum measurements accessible and practical, this team is laying the groundwork for a technological renaissance, driving substantial societal progress. The QuPID team harnesses the collaborative power of the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory to develop the first ultrabroad-band Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits (Q-PICs) for field-deployable spectroscopic quantum metrologies. By transforming existing quantum-photonic components and innovating new elements, the team creates Quantum Process Design Kits (Q-PDKs) that integrate ultrawide bandgap III–nitride ferroelectric quantum materials with silicon photonics, surpassing traditional limits on precision, speed, and resource usage. These efforts seamlessly combine coherent, attosecond, and quantum spectroscopies to a novel quantum-sensing tool for imaging quantum dynamics within interacting multi-particle systems. In eight years, the team engineers Q-PDKs that tailor quantum-sensing capabilities for diverse industries, making high-precision quantum measurements accessible and practical.

NQVL:QSTD:Pilot: Quantum sensing and imaging lab (Q-SAIL),"Quantum sensing presents a unique opportunity for early adoption of technology with a true quantum advantage in the market. The Quantum Sensing and Imaging Lab (Q-SAIL) develops high-performance quantum sensors for a variety of applications ranging from frequency metrology and fundamental physics to terahertz (THz) and hyperspectral imaging, based on two-dimensional arrays of trapped ions. Optical atomic clocks based on single trapped ions, for example, are the most accurate sensors of any type, with systematic uncertainties below one part in 10^{18}. This performance has the potential to revolutionize existing frequency metrology applications such as telecommunications and navigation, as well as enable new capabilities such as relativistic geodesy and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Q-SAIL’s sensors leverage entangled ion arrays to improve the bandwidth of optical frequency metrology by an order of magnitude or more beyond what is possible with classical sensors. THz imaging has applications in medicine and astronomy, but current sensors suffer from low quantum efficiency. Q-SAIL THz imaging sensors use molecular ions as pixels to achieve high quantum efficiency, and implement quantum compressed sensing algorithms with entangled arrays of molecules for highly sensitive spatial or spectral pattern recognition. Q-SAIL’s central quantum science technology demonstration (QSTD) is a 128-zone microfabricated surface-electrode ion trap array with integrated passive and active photonics for laser generation, control, and delivery. At each ion trap zone, a single logic ion qubit is trapped together with one or more sensor ion(s), which is a different atomic or molecular ion species for each sensing application, using quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS). The sensor ions in different trap zones are entangled with each other via quantum gates with and between the logic ions, and can serve as individual pixels for imaging applications or combined using multi-ensemble clock protocols, quantum compressed sensing, quantum variational optimization, or quantum machine learning for precision sensing of scalar signals. The Q-SAIL user community is invited to contribute hardware modules, propose new sensing modalities, test new sensing algorithms, and use this flexible quantum platform to explore their own applications of interest.

First, the project formulates the specific ion trap hardware architecture for the device, driven by aggressive performance metrics needed to execute the desired application space. Second, the project innovates on the component technologies of the QACTI system, such as optical control systems including integrated optical devices and ion trap and vacuum packaging solutions. Third, the project identifies a particular class of quantum algorithms to be pursued, likely involving a hybrid compute model that takes full advantage of standard computers. Fourth, the project creates improved software expressions that map high level applications to native architectural elements such as gate protocols, connectivity, and qubit modularity. The project is creating and implementing a workforce development program to train future researchers in quantum information science and engineering. This project advances the objectives of Quantum Information Science and Engineering at NSF in response to the National Quantum Initiative Act for the continued leadership of the United States in QIS and its technology applications.

MRI: Track 1 Development of a quantum scanning near field optical microscope (q-SNOM) for research in quantum materials,"This Major Research Instrumentation award supports Columbia University with the development of a quantum nano-scope (q-SNOM), a unique imaging and spectroscopy instrument with capabilities to measure true quantum coherent properties of the next generation of materials and on-the-chip devices. The most significant novel experiments enabled by the proposed apparatus are the witnessing, verifying, and quantifying of quantum coherence in materials, heterostructures and molecular systems at the native length scales of all these phenomena. The apparatus is designed as a user-friendly instrument and will be made available to research groups within and outside Columbia through established protocols at shared user facilities operated by Columbia Nano Initiative. The q-SNOM project will have multifaceted research and training impacts. The quantum nano-scope will enhance research not only at Columbia but also at several universities in the New York City area extending to Stony Brook University. At the larger national level, the experiments enabled by quantum nano-scope are unique and will address pressing open problems leading to high-impact results in the field of quantum science and technology. Also, the q-SNOM will aid the competitiveness of US companies in the quantum area. Specifically, the project includes industrial partners at Cryogenic Industries, Renaissance Scientific and RHK, government laboratories and in the emerging quantum industry. Finally, the award creates a unique training ground for graduate students and summer undergraduate students within the Columbia-Howard Research Experience for Undergraduates program in a project requiring innovation in optics, quantum metrology, and mechanical solutions. The objective of this MRI project is to develop an entirely novel scanning probe nano-optical apparatus: the quantum scattering near-field optical microscope (q-SNOM), which will enable previously impossible inquiries into quantum correlations in quantum materials at deeply subdiffractional nanometer length scales. The q-SNOM will provide unobstructed access to electron-photon states formed by material excitations and entangled photons. Information on quantum coherence and dephasing effects in materials encoded in the properties of emitted or scattered photons will be readily accessible. Moreover, the q-SNOM offers the means to investigate the properties of quantum emitters and correlated photon waveguides at the nanoscale in the setting of on-chip structures, thus empowering both fundamental and applied advances. Q-SNOM will be a stable research instrument readily manageable by users with minimum experience with conventional SNOMs and broadly accessible as a shared-use tool at CNI-Columbia. The q-SNOM will extend the reach of the quantum optics toolbox to the nanoscale. The immediate impact will be in research in molecular systems, technologically important quantum dots and quantum materials. Once deployed in real applications producing publishable results, q-SNOM is likely to become a standard tool in multidisciplinary quantum research, enabling new experiments in physics, chemistry and engineering with an impact on par with that of its classical predecessor.

BSM-PM: Molecular Lattice Clock for Metrology and Tests of New Physics,"Precise experiments performed with tabletop setups offer remarkable opportunities for exploring physics and probing beyond its known boundaries. These methods, which include atomic and molecular clocks, are capable of testing fundamental symmetries, measuring the constants of nature, and observing subtle general relativistic effects. Such experiments are also crucial for ambitious goals like detecting gravitational waves and hypothetical dark matter. Optical atomic clocks, made highly precise by advancements in optical technologies as well as in laser cooling and trapping of atoms, exemplify this potential. Small molecules, with their more complex structure than atoms, present even richer opportunities but are challenging to control. The PI’s research group has developed a molecular clock that tightly holds diatomic molecules in an optical lattice trap, isolating them from their environment. This setup allows them to use molecular vibrations to precisely sense the force between atoms, potentially revealing modifications to Newtonian gravity at the nanometer scale. Additionally, this research provides outstanding training opportunities for students, equipping them with hands-on skills in cutting-edge fields of science, and supporting innovative educational programs. Investigating gravity-like interactions in the nanometer range, where electrostatic forces strongly dominate, is largely uncharted territory. Vibrating diatomic molecules, especially when used in a clock configuration with state-insensitive optical traps, offer a promising approach to these studies. This technique already allows for a clock quality factor of several trillion, which the PI’s group aims to further enhance with improved cooling of strontium atoms and optimized optical lattice traps. The state-of-the-art molecular clock will utilize multiple vibrational states and strontium isotopes to control molecular bond lengths and nuclear masses, which are key parameters for mapping interatomic forces with unprecedented precision. These experiments will also advance theoretical quantum chemistry, terahertz metrology, tests of fundamental constant stability, ultracold chemistry, and molecular quantum control techniques.

Boosting Single-Molecule Spectroscopy of Rapid Biomolecular Processes  with Microfluidic Mixing and Nanophotonic Enhancement,"The study of biomolecular mechanisms has benefited greatly from single-molecule spectroscopy, especially single-molecule FRET, which allows conformational and kinetic heterogeneities to be resolved across a wide range of timescales. However, many processes have remained inaccessible to detailed investigation, for example because they can only be probed under nonequilibrium conditions, or because they occur too rapidly to be observed by existing techniques. In this project, we will develop and adapt microfluidic and nanophotonic approaches to overcome such limitations.Many important biomolecular systems, such as positively charged disordered or very hydrophobic proteins, have eluded mechanistic investigation on short timescales because of their pronounced surface adhesion in microfluidic mixing devices. We will enable such nonequilibrium experiments down to the millisecond timescale by developing droplet-based rapid microfluidic mixing and fluoropolymer-based microfluidic devices for confocal single-molecule spectroscopy. We will further enhance microfluidic measurements by multiplexed detection with SPAD arrays to increase throughput, extend the available information, and achieve feasibility for nonequilibrium nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which currently has prohibitively long data acquisition times.Based on promising initial results, we will further establish and optimize the use of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) for nanophotonic enhancement in single-molecule FRET experiments to increase photon detection rates and improve the time resolution of correlation measurements down to the low nanosecond range. Finally, we will integrate ZMWs directly into rapid microfluidic mixing devices to enable such nanophotonics-enhanced measurements under nonequilibrium conditions. The combination of novel microfluidic mixing techniques and ZMW-based nanophotonics is expected to provide a substantial boost to single-molecule spectroscopy of biomolecules.",996634,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; Physical Sciences
Ultrasound wave-momentum shaping for precise micromanipulation,"The precise, non-contact manipulation of selective label-free objects using electromagnetic or acoustic waves stands as a central focus in various areas of science, from biology to material science and medicine. The mastery of these techniques holds the potential for groundbreaking and unparalleled advancements across a diverse spectrum of technological applications. These applications span from the realms of biological analysis and tissue engineering methodologies to the refinement of medical protocols for localized drug administration. Moreover, they extend into applications such as screen-free displays suspended in the air, or on-demand reconfigurability in additive manufacturing. Two main approaches have been investigated to date. On the one hand, tweezers based on the formation of potential wells in wave fields have been developed to trap objects and particles. With acoustic waves, which are the focus of the present document due to their biocompatibility, the trapping condition has mainly been achieved using the node and antinode of standing waves or focused vortex beams either in air or water. On the other hand, the combination of acoustics and fluid mechanics in on-chip microchannels, known as acoustofluidics, has been used to leverage biomedical technology applications such as cell and particle sorting, pairing or separation, opening the way to workflow automation. However, all these methods only work in very controlled environments and would completely fail in non-static or scattering media, therefore radically lacking adaptability and reconfigurability.In this four-year intensive research effort, we aim at solving the weaknesses of current technologies by opening a new avenue for acoustic micromanipulation in dynamic and complex media, based on a novel ultrasonic wave-momentum shaping method. We will devote our expertise and workforce to achieve two interconnected objectives: (i) based on a theory validated with full-wave simulations and preliminary measurements, we will design, engineer and fabricate an experimental microscopy set-up combining ultrasonic wavefront shaping and far-field scattering measurements to selectively manipulate small particles and objects ranging in size from micrometres to millimetres, including in dynamic or multiple-scattering environments; and (ii), we will use this new protocol to explore open scientific questions and demonstrate innovative technological applications such as precise drug delivery. To achieve these ambitious goals, we will build on preliminary results from a macromanipulation proof-of-concept experiment developed in our laboratory, and study in detail the limits of the current protocol and set-up, in order to improve the promising manipulation possibilities achieved so far and transpose them to smaller scales. A comprehensive understanding of the scaling effect and potential limitations will be a major asset for the efficient design of the micromanipulation prototype, which will require inventive ultrasonic wave control techniques. The fabricated prototypes and robust protocol will then offer unprecedented manipulation possibilities, enabling the exploration of new physics (dynamics of a wave-particle-environment system, exploitation of reconfigurable thermal properties from microscopic particles mutual interaction) and technological applications (drug delivery, cellular manipulation, etc).",989504,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Austria,Switzerland,Engineering; Classical Physics
Resonant X-ray scattering instrument for exploration of spin polarized quantum matter,"Manipulation of quantum materials by high external magnetic fields - as an external non-thermal parameter - is a well-established route for realizing exotic quantum phases of matter and achieving control over their materials properties, such as inducing transitions between insulating and metallic, or high-temperature (high-Tc) superconducting and charge-density wave ordered phases. Such non-thermal control is also of great importance for the development of future quantum devices. On the other hand, Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is a powerful electronic-state-selective probe of collective excitations involving either lattice, charge, orbital or spin degrees of freedom. RIXS is unique as it provides direct access to these elementary excitations, even of small single crystals and thin films as available at the frontier of quantum materials and device research. However, probing such excitations in high external magnetic fields is so far limited to bulk-sensitive probes with higher penetration, e.g., neutrons or hard X-rays. We propose here to build a dedicated experimental setup for the application of high magnetic fields, connected to an ultrahigh-energy resolution RIXS spectrometer. This will not only allow unique, non-magnetic background-free Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) RIXS, but also to explore unchartered regimes of field-temperature phase diagrams of quantum matter. In particular, the proposed sample environment for quantum materials research will comprise of a novel high-magnetic field 6-axis liquid 4He manipulator (sub-8 K base temperature) that is optimized for RIXS. Using compact superconducting copper oxide magnet coils of ~2 cm diameter, integrated in the manipulator head, magnetic fields of larger than 6 T will be generated. Importantly, our team has recently built up experience with such high-Tc coils in the context of accelerator physics. Within the SLS 2.0 upgrade of the Paul Scherrer Institut’s (PSI) Swiss Light Source synchrotron, a new high-resolution beamline for soft X-ray spectroscopy, ADRESS 2.0, will be constructed, employing state-of-the art optical elements and refocusing to a small X-ray spot size of 1 x 4 µm2. To exploit this scientific opportunity, we propose to combine the high-field manipulator with an ultrahigh-energy resolution RIXS spectrometer of 10 m length, resulting in at least a factor of 5 increased energy resolution matching that of the new beamline from which also chemistry, environmental and energy science research will benefit. The spectrometer will also allow continuous rotation to flexibly access specific points in reciprocal space. The proposed instrumentation enables fundamentally new science and technology by providing direct access to the low-energy properties of spin polarized quantum matter, e.g., chiral and time-reversal symmetry-breaking magnets, and, more generally, the application of quantum materials for future electronic and spintronic devices. To also shed light on respective dynamic effects, the high-magnetic field manipulator will be fully compatible with out-of-equilibrium time-resolved RIXS at the FURKA endstation of PSI’s X-ray free-electron laser Swiss-FEL.",979263,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Endstation for attosecond and nonlinear XFEL science at the SwissFEL Athos beamline,"The scientific frontiers of ultrafast and non-linear X-ray science are expanding rapidly due to the continued development and improvement of X-ray free electron laser (XFELs) sources, which deliver intense radiation in the X-ray spectral range with pulse durations down to the few-femtosecond level. XFEL pulses generated through the process of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) are now routinely employed to follow the dynamic structural response of gaseous, liquid and condensed matter systems in real-time. However, the overall temporal resolution that can typically be achieved in XFEL experiments is limited to >20 femtoseconds, due to intrinsic shot-to-shot fluctuations of the X-ray pulse lengths and arrival times related to the stochastic nature of the SASE FEL process. At present, this random nature of XFEL radiation prevents access to the real-time evolution of transient charge rearrangements in atoms, molecules, solids and interfaces, which proceed on the attosecond (1 asec = 10-18 s) timescale - yet these dynamics underpin almost all fundamental reactions and phase transitions in nature and technological applications.Comprehensive access to these ultrafast attosecond phenomena will become possible with new nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies using fully coherent X-ray radiation. Coherence in the X-ray beam can be imprinted by seeding the FEL emission process with an external laser. SwissFEL Athos is the ideal platform for pioneering such new approaches as its modular design supports progressive upgrade from SASE-type to external laser seeded operation. At Athos, a variety of schemes can be explored for the generation of intense, fully coherent, sub-femtosecond transform-limited X-ray pulses or otherwise tailored X-ray emission. However, precise photon diagnostic tools are prerequisite for the reliable delivery of coherent X-ray radiation, as well as for its successful application in experiments.Here, we propose to develop and implement a highly flexible endstation dedicated to attosecond and non-linear XFEL research at the SwissFEL soft X-ray beamline Athos. The new endstation will be optimized for single-shot characterization of the temporal structure and coherence properties of the seeded XFEL pulses. The unique combination of these pulses together with synchronised external optical laser sources in a single endstation at SwissFEL will enable novel sub-femtosecond time-resolved X-ray studies of linear and non-linear light-matter interaction and coherent field-driven phenomena.",969896,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Chemical Sciences; Quantum Physics
WoU-MMA: Extremely High Energy Neutrinos in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory,"High energy neutrinos are unique messengers to the distant universe. Neutrinos are extremely small and lightweight particles that are created in high energy interactions. They are particularly powerful probes because they are weakly interacting – they can travel vast distances without being stopped, and are not bent by magnetic fields. This makes them complementary probes to the other high energy particles we know of – cosmic rays and gamma rays. This proposal will use the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for the highest energy neutrinos possible – events above 1 PeV. IceCube is a neutrino detector at the South Pole deployed over 2km deep within the glacier in Antarctica. It uses photosensors to measure the blue flashes of light generated by neutrino interactions in the ice. By searching for these extremely high energy (EHE) events, we will study the origin and nature of the highest energy accelerators in the universe. Because neutrinos are expected to be produced in the same locations as cosmic rays and gamma rays, the observations of neutrinos provide definitive evidence of charged particle acceleration. And because they can travel far distances unimpeded, they track how the accelerators are distributed throughout space and time across the history of the universe. Additionally, these EHE neutrinos are hundreds of times more energetic than any particles which can be produced on Earth, allowing us to study physics at new energy scales. The goal of this project is to enhance IceCube’s search for EHE neutrino events. We plan several technical advancements to make this possible. Searching for EHE neutrinos with IceCube is challenging because of the need to reject the overwhelming flux of atmospheric muons that arise from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere. We plan to develop new methods for separating these backgrounds from neutrino signals through use of new variables, such as stochasticity, and new techniques, such as machine learning algorithms. We also plan to improve both the energy and directional reconstruction algorithms used in the detector to account for detector effects such as PMT saturation. With these enhanced capabilities, we will conduct the most sensitive search for neutrinos above 100 PeV, with the potential to observe O(5) EeV scale neutrinos. The search could also yield important insights into the shape of the astrophysical flux in the 1-100 PeV regime. These two measurements combined will indicate whether the PeV neutrino sky is fundamentally different from the TeV neutrino sky, or if nature transitions to new and more powerful accelerators. We will also use these methods to enhance IceCube's realtime follow-up program, boosting its contribution to multimessenger science through improved purity and angular resolution. We will additionally contribute to a program of outreach and education by mentoring an undergraduate scholar through the UMD GRAD-MAP program and other events like “Maryland Day.” The award is aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-messenger Astrophysics as it coordinates the use of multi-messengers observations utilizing cosmic neutrinos and providing alerts to the larger community.

Optical measurements and weak decays searches with liquid xenon detectors,"Currently the main open questions in astroparticle physics are related to the nature of dark matter and neutrinos. To shed light into these, xenon based experiments have been extensively used. The best limits on direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) dark matter candidate and neutrinoless double beta (0vßß) decay are coming from experiments using xenon.The project addresses two important aspects. The first goal is to improve the understanding of the microphysics in liquid xenon (LXe). Many experiments rely on measuring the light produced by the particle interactions scattering off xenon atoms. With detectors requiring larger and larger volumes, up to more than 2 m in one dimension, understanding the light propagation and attenuation in LXe is a bottleneck in providing accurate results, both on the physics of xenon and the detector itself and on the physics results coming from these experiments. Measurements on the light attenuation in LXe are outdated and report different results. Furthermore these measurements were carried out in small setups.Recent results on this topic are coming from experiments using liquid argon as target medium. For this purpose I propose to carry out a new measurement of the light attenuation in LXe with a large setup. The University of Zurich is a unique place for this scope, not only in Switzerland but in the World, as it is the only place where a cryostat with an inner vessel of 312 cm in height and 24.8 cm in diameter, and related infrastructures, as cryogenics and xenon storage, working with LXe, have been already commissioned. The cryostat is now equipped with a purity monitor and soon will be upgraded with a time projection chamber (TPC). The TPC will be equipped with an array of photomultipliers and silicon-photomultipliers at the top and bottom, respectively. The goal of this project is to equip the TPC with a system to shine vacuum ultraviolet light with a wavelength of ~175 nm, corresponding to the scintillation in LXe, and to measure optical properties as the light attenuation in LXe and extract related quantities of interests, such as the Rayleigh scattering, group velocity, Sellmeier coefficients.The second goal of this proposal is to expand the physic reach of the LXe TPC detectors, in particular with the XENONnT experiment, a multi-tonnes scale dual-phase TPC, currently taking data with the main goal of WIMP dark matter search. Its precursor, XENON1T, has already demonstrated the capability for such type of detectors to look well beyond the WIMP energy range and to be able to give substantial contributions to the neutrino field with the first measurement of the two-neutrino double electron capture of 124Xe and a stringent limit on 0vßß of 136Xe. However the latter is still not competitive with dedicated experiments due to the high background rate at the energy of the decay, around 2.5 MeV. Here I propose to extend this work to new physics channels, such as the zero-neutrino double electron capture (0vECEC) of 124Xe, the first of this kind in xenon dual phase TPCs. Due to the complex signature of the resonant 0vECEC, comprising X-rays, Auger electrons and gamma cascades, machine learning algorithms will be necessary to tag signals coming from this decay. Furthermore, background rejection in the region of interest of these processes can also be improved by exploiting these tools, such as the available python packages of sklearn and keras.",961370,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Eyes Wide Open - Searching for Continuous Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter with LIGO,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. Gravitational wave detections from colliding black holes and neutron stars have now become almost routine since the first epochal discoveries in 2015 and 2017, as the number of detections continues to grow. The next game-changing discovery may well come, not from such cataclysmic collisions, but rather from the smooth ""hum"" of a fast-spinning, slightly bumpy neutron star in our own galaxy, one emitting continuous gravitational waves. Such a source could emit detectable radiation for the foreseeable future, allowing follow-up investigations of exquisite precision. It would likely become one of the most studied objects in astronomical history, as gamma-ray, X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio telescopes would all be trained on this nearby, ultimate multi-messenger target. Its study would provide critical insight into the still poorly understood structure of neutron stars, which contain matter in an extreme physical state inaccessible to terrestrial experiments. The research to be carried out will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge. Research will focus on a number of specific areas related to the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) Experiment. Searches for continuous gravitational waves from 1) unknown isolated neutron stars anywhere in our galaxy; 2) isolated neutron stars at the centers of young, nearby supernova remnants; and (as Nature permits) from relatively nearby post-merger remnants or very nearby newborn neutron stars in our own or neighboring galaxies. In addition, detector characterization of Advanced LIGO interferometers focused on spectral line identification and mitigation will be carried out, to improve searches for nearly monochromatic continuous gravitational waves.

A Superconductor-Spin Hybrid Quantum System for Quantum Simulation,"Quantum simulation is based on the idea of using a well-controlled quantum system to reproduce the behaviour of complex and strongly correlated systems that would otherwise be impossible to simulate with a classical computer. Moreover, reproducing in a controlled manner the behaviour of physical systems with extraordinary, exotic properties offers great opportunities for quantum information technology, for example to improve the robustness of quantum communication protocols, or to realize ever more sensitive and precise quantum sensors. Quantum simulators have undergone a rapid development in the last decades, triggering new scientific questions, such as the possibility to engineer new phases of quantum matter.Circuits made of superconducting materials allow excellent control over the propagation of microwave (MW) photons and can implement strong nonlinearities at the single-photon level. Superconducting circuits have thus emerged as one of the most promising platforms for quantum simulation of open, out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. The proposed project aims to develop a new integrated, hybrid quantum system made of optically addressable spin ensembles coupled with deep-subwavelength superconducting microwave resonators.Ultra-compact subwavelength microwave resonators based on superconducting materials such as niobium nitride (NbN) thin films, which remain superconducting up to few K, have recently been developed. They offer great perspective for scalability toward macroscopic numbers of resonators in 2D arrays. On the other hand, nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are impurity spins than exhibit long coherence time and can be optically manipulated and read-out. They are a good candidate for a hybrid quantum system with superconducting circuits, which suffer from short coherence time, and from poor readout-out capability for large, 2D lattices, due to the planar geometry of the system that only allows easy access to its edges.In a first part of the project, I will use NV centers as MW detectors to image the MW field amplitude and direction in ultracompact superconducting resonators. The goal is to provide direct access to the spatial profile of the photonic eigenmodes of a 2D array of subwavelength resonators. The development of MW imaging methods suited to 2D resonator arrays will answer an immediate need and is expected to foster on-chip quantum simulation with superconducting circuits.The second part of the project will be dedicated to demonstrating collective coupling of spatially distinct NV ensembles mediated by their coupling to superconducting resonator arrays. Strongly coupling each MW resonator of a lattice to a small ensemble of NV spins will allow exploration of new superradiant phases that have no counterpart in closed systems. This new platform is expected to bring a broad range of quantum simulation problems within reach and to improve our understanding of correlated many-body states away from equilibrium.",959373,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
CAREER: How does external photoevaporation shape planets?,"Observations have revealed a remarkable diversity of planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. Planets form in disks of gas and dust around newborn stars, but disks disappear as the stars age, limiting the opportunity for planets to form. Disks may spiral into the central star or evaporate from the inside-out via the newborn star’s photons. However, external photoevaporation from a nearby, much brighter star can destroy disks more quickly, reducing the time and materials to make planets. While this phenomenon has been observed in a few objects, this project will quantify whether such external photoevaporation is a major player in this story of planet formation. Leveraging a large dataset of young star clusters, Dr. Megan Reiter of Rice University and her research associates will measure the disks themselves, starlight impinging on them, and matter streaming away from them. In parallel, an educational program to encourage entrance and persistence in STEM fields will be implemented in two parts: an active-learning teacher training and astronomy-inspired curriculum for Houston K-12 schools, and foundational skills will be added to observational lab courses at Rice University; these interventions will preferentially help historically underrepresented groups. To quantify this environmental impact on planet formation, Dr. Reiter has secured more than 100 hours of telescope time using the integral field unit spectrograph MUSE on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. The goal is to observe thousands of low-mass stars and their disks in high-mass star-forming regions of at least 1000 times the mass of the Sun – a sample 100 times larger than existing studies. These data cleanly separate stellar emission from the bright, variable nebular background. Spectral diagnostics indicate active external photoevaporation and quantify the mass-loss rate. A scaling relationship between incident UV flux and external disk photoevaporation will be derived, useful when theorists model the demographics of planets. The methods developed and astronomy professionals supported by this work will be in high demand when 30-meter class ground-based telescopes become available. The educational intervention will include value-engaged evaluation, a new way to test whether updated pedagogy improves retention in STEM courses at Rice and beyond.

Topological phases and phase transitions in frustrated magnets,"I propose to study exotic phenomena, such as topological order and quantum spin liquids (QSL), in frustrated magnetic models and materials. The project focuses on, but is not limited to, the following topics:1. Effective field theories for quantum spin liquids    a) Tensor-network representation of QSL wave functions    b) Chiral topological orders in Heisenberg models    c) Topological band theory of fractionalised quasiparticles, novel paradigms of topological order and transport2. Applications to experimentally relevant systems    a) Quantum spin ice on the pyrochlore and kagome lattices    b) Kitaev honeycomb model and alpha-RuCl3    c) Machine-learning approaches to spin-liquid physicsThese projects reinforce each other but can be carried out with minimal interdependence. Projects in Stream 2, in particular, relate closely to neutron-scattering and muon-spin-rotation experiments carried out at PSI, while theoretical projects in Stream 1 will benefit from collaboration with established groups at UZH, ETH, PSI, and institutions beyond Switzerland.I request funding for a PhD student, who will (at least initially) focus on developing computational approaches using insight from field theories of QSL physics. This background will allow them to broaden their expertise in both computational and analytical directions as they mature.Successful completion of the proposed research would greatly enhance our understanding of topological order in QSLs, yield testable predictions for a range of materials of topical experimental interest, and potentially open novel directions for topologically ordered matter that are not anticipated by the current state of research.",948984,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,United Kingdom,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Kagome lattice based magnetic topological semimetals,"There has been a large interest in quantum materials ranging from 2-dimensional electron gases hosting the quantum Hall effect, high Tc superconductors, to more recently graphene and topological insulators for their intriguing fundamental properties but also for potential applications in electronic devices and information technology.  In many of these systems, the role of topology is believed to be crucial to their fundamental properties. However, large numbers of publications notwithstanding, direct signatures of topology and exploitation of topological properties are still not well explored.The overall objective of the project is to identify and manipulate topological properties in quantum materials with a kagome motif in both bulk and thin film form.  Systems with a kagome motiv are interesting since they are predicted to display flat bands and Dirac points in the ideal case.  In addition, a large number of Weyl systems with broken time reversal symmetry have been identified in kagome lattices.  We aim to study kagome systems that host Weyl nodes that arise from broken time reversal symmetry, i.e., Weyl systems that exhibit magnetic order such as ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism.  By growing thin films as well as fabricating devices, we expect to discover new phenomena derived from underlying topological properties of the electronic states. This will have a great impact in the field where control of topological properties has not been much explored, which as in conventional semiconductors are likely to become the platforms for devices.",925589,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Accurate modeling of dark matter - electron interactions in liquid xenon and argon,"We propose a combined effective field theory (EFT) and density-functional theory (DFT) study of the interaction of light dark matter with liquid xenon (Xe) and argon (Ar). Our work is motivated by the huge global experimental effort to detect dark matter particles through their interaction with nucleons, the null results of which place strong constraints on possible dark matter masses and point to lighter dark matter particles. Such light dark matter particles are now being sought through their interactions with the electronic subsystems of liquid xenon and argon in low-background deep underground detectors. Key to the interpretation of these searches is the response of the detector material to dark matter-electron interactions; the development and application of methodologies for calculating such responses for liquid Xe and Ar is the subject of this proposal.The goal of this project is to develop, numerically implement and apply a theoretical framework to accurately describe the expected DM-induced electron ionisation events in operating liquid xenon and argon detectors by combining a state-of-the-art DFT-based treatment of the xenon and argon liquid phase with a general form of the underlying DM-electron interaction. This timely project lays the foundations for a new, cross-disciplinary line of research that will have the following  outcomes: i) a comprehensive theoretical description of low energy dark matter -- material interactions, ii) publically available computer codes to calculate dark matter -- electron interaction rates that combine this theory with state-of-the-art electronic-structure calculations, and iii) results and analysis of dark matter interactions for liquid Ar and Xe. In addition to their obvious relevance for the Xe- and Ar-based experimental collaborations, our results may guide discussions of possible future architectures and materials for earth-based dark-matter detectors.",918043,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Sweden,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Collaborative Research: The Search for Light Dark Matter with DAMIC,"Dark matter is a ubiquitous yet invisible presence in our universe. It dictated how galaxies formed in the first place, and now moves their stars at puzzling speeds. From these and other colossal gravitational effects the dark matter mass in the universe is known to be five times that of ordinary matter and composed of unknown particles, which interact weakly with ordinary matter. This award will support the Dark MAtter In CCDs (DAMIC) experiment, which searches for dark matter particles with a novel detector technology. The nature of dark matter constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science. Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. This award will enable immersive research experiences for students, engagement of the local community and the general public, and innovative partnerships bringing science to formal and informal audiences. The DAMIC experiment is designed to detect nuclear and electronic recoils induced by dark matter in silicon charge coupled devices (CCDs). Scientific CCDs are commonly used in the focal plane of astronomical telescopes for the digital imaging of faint astrophysical objects. DAMIC has pioneered their unconventional use as dark matter detectors at the SNOLAB laboratory (located in a mine 2 km beneath Sudbury, Canada); with this award a several-hundred-gram detector - DAMIC-M - will be installed at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane in France. Single ionization charges produced by a dark matter interaction will be detected in DAMIC-M with high resolution thanks to non-destructive, repetitive measurements of the CCD pixel charge. With this novel technology DAMIC-M will have unprecedented sensitivity to light dark matter (≈ eV energies are enough to free an electron in silicon). This award will support the participation and leadership roles of the research groups at University of Chicago and University of Washington in the DAMIC experiment construction, installation and commissioning. The award scope includes collecting a data sample corresponding to a target exposure of few hundred g-year and performing a first search for dark matter. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",915152,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Plasma detachment in tokamaks: from the physics fundamentals to real-time control in reactor-relevant scenarios,"Handling the heat exhaust is considered among the greatest uncertainties on the way to fusion energy, one of the few options we have for providing mankind with sustainable power supply. In fact, the thermal load on the plasma facing components may, in high-performance fusion devices, exceed what can be handled by today available materials, a possible showstopper for the entire fusion program. While a number of techniques to mitigate the heat flux are being developed, operation in detachment conditions is currently considered the most promising approach. In detachment, hydrogenic isotopes or gaseous impurities are puffed into the proximity of the divertor targets. This leads to a complex set of atomic processes between the plasma and the neutral species, including excitation, dissociation, ionization and recombination. These processes result in an increase of the radiation from the plasma. Radiation lowers the plasma temperature decreasing the heat flux to the vessel walls. Because of the complexity of the physical phenomena involved in detachment, tokamak wall systems are still designed largely with simulation codes based upon theoretical considerations as well as empirical extrapolations from present-day devices. Despite important progress over the last years, this approach presents significant limitations that can be overcome only through first-principles simulations. The first-ever first-principles simulations of plasma detachment was carried out with the GBS code very recently; however, predictive capabilities necessary for the operation and design of future fusion devices in detachment conditions are yet to be achieved. This limitation stems from the reduced number of species that turbulence codes can evolve and a reduced number of atomic processes they describe. Their reliability is further affected by the limitations of the fluid model they implement that cannot be used to study the plasma dynamics in H-mode conditions, relevant to high-performance fusion devices, and the lack of a detailed description of the plasma-wall interaction. In addition, the cost of boundary turbulence simulation remains high and, while simulations of medium size tokamak are now possible, ITER and DEMO simulations remain a significant challenge. The main goal of this proposal is to overcome the limitations of first-principles codes to enable predictive simulations of tokamak detachment. By building upon the GBS code, we will use a first-principles approach to the plasma and neutral dynamics up to the size of ITER and DEMO, complemented by atomistic, quantum-mechanical simulations of the plasma-facing materials. By developing robust predictive capabilities of plasma detachment in tokamaks, and retaining continual interest in its real-time control, the activities of this proposal will provide an essential contribution to the understanding and control of detachment in future fusion power plant and, ultimately, to the realisation of fusion energy.",911589,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene and beyond,"Background and rationaleIn 2018, experiments on twisted bilayer graphene showed that it is superconducting and the mechanism behind this phenomenon is still unknown. Twisted bilayer graphene is part of a growing class of materials that have flat bands, meaning that the interactions between electrons are enhanced. The materials challenge our usual assumptions about how electrons behave. I will investigate twisted bilayer graphene as the archetype of a flat band material and then move on to other materials as well as proposing new material realizations. Objectives and aimsThe broad questions guiding the project are the following:Q1: What is the superconducting mechanism in twisted bilayer graphene?Q2: What leads to the strange metal behaviour in twisted bilayer graphene?Q3: What is the phase diagram of twisted trilayer graphene with strain?Q4: What is the superconducting mechanism in untwisted graphene multilayers?Q5: How can we efficiently simulate one dimensional flat-band systems?Q6: How can we engineer flat band systems in three dimensions?MethodsThese projects will be tackled using numerical techniques such as Hartree-Fock and functional renormalization group that I have experience with. In the later stages of the project I aim to develop new numerical techniques and propose new materials that should be investigated experimentally. Results and ImpactThe aim of this project would be to identify a mechanism for superconductivity in these flat band materials and find experimental signatures that can unambiguously confirm or refute this mechanism. Furthermore, we aim to develop a unified framework which explains all these materials, and provide a numerical toolbox which is flexible enough to study any material in this class. Strange metals and unconventional superconductivity are two phenomena that already occur in the high temperature superconductors the knowledge acquired by studying flat band systems may be transferable to these materials as well. High temperature superconductivity is one of the biggest unsolved problems in condensed matter physics and it has technological implications. Superconductors already have many practical applications, they are used in medical scanners, to levitate high-speed trains, for lossless electrical transmission lines and for building quantum computers.",909999,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions: Precision cosmology in the light of LISA (PRECLISA),"Understanding the connection between the matter content of the universe and its thermal history is a major challenge in cosmology. A direct observation of the early universe in a broad temperature range is merely realized via gravitational waves (GW). Invigorated by the LIGO-VIRGO detection of GW from binary black hole mergers, GW sourced from cosmological phase transitions could be scoped by future experiments such as LISA. Such a detection could result in discovering physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) by accessing a part of the thermal history that answers the question: is there new physics at or above the electroweak scale?Next-generation space-based interferometers in the coming decade render reliable theoretical GW predictions indispensable. The PRECLISA project delivers the required precision.Existing predictions of a relic gravitational wave background from a cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) suffer from large theoretical uncertainties in the range of a hundred to a million uncertainty in the GW peak amplitude. Such uncertainty creates large ambiguity if a signal is even detectable by next-generation of GW telescopes. Therefore, being precise and reliable is crucial given the prospect of next generations of colliders, and gravitational wave detector experiments as LISA, as well as new substantial clarification of the dynamics of weak interactions at the LHC.(P1) Research problem: Theoretical predictions of gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions are compromised by large uncertainties.For two decades connecting BSM phenomenology and gravitational waves was prevented by these uncertainties. Their root source is the slow convergence of perturbative high-temperature calculations. Only by re-organizing the computations in an effective field theory framework (3d EFT), could we reach the highest perturbative order for any gravitational wave prediction to date. The systematics and rigorous separation of energy scales in such a framework is the backbone to resolve the long-standing research problem (P1).Objective: By upgrading the theoretical 3d EFT framework, the objective of the PRECLISA project is to understand perturbative thermodynamics of cosmological phase transitions at unprecedented accuracy -- and open the door for gravitational wave precision cosmology.Upon completion of the proposed research, gravitational wave predictions will emerge at a newly established standard. The projected precision target is a dramatic decrease in uncertainty. The developed cutting edge techniques will be disseminated to the community via publicly available software that pushes all theoretical stages in the determination of GW signals to their perturbative limits.",909906,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Exploring the magneto-optical response of thin films with a unique broadband generalized ellipsometry technique,"I propose a study of the magneto-optical response of quantum materials on the form of thin film and bulk samples using broadband THz and infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry and polarimetry in magnetic fields.Optical spectroscopy is a valuable tool in the field of condensed matter physics. Particularly infrared (low energy) spectroscopy - combined with cryogenics - brings insight to the lattice, carrier and spin dynamics of unconventional materials (high temperature superconductors, multiferroics, topological insulators and semimetals).However, relatively little attention is dedicated to the corresponding infrared optical response of thin films of such materials, in particular for anisotropic, strain-engineered films on anisotropic substrates, and their magneto-optical behaviour, due to the experimental complexity and lack of methodology. I want to address this and focus on several optically complex systems including thin films, anisotropy, gyrotropy, strong magneto-optic effects and magneto-electric couplings utilizing the existing ellipsometric instruments, some of which I have built and developed myself. Spectroscopic ellipsometry in the IR and THz part of spectrum is rather unique, especially as combination of broad spectral range with high magnetic fields and temperature control that is readily available in our labs.In particular, we will study thin films of complex oxides, such as strained multiferroic RMnO3 (R = Gd-Lu) films to detail the structural changes induced by strain, temperature or magnetic field, and search for signs of a dynamic magneto-electric coupling (electromagnons). Next, we will study the magneto- optical response and spin-phonon coupling in the anomalous Hall antiferromagnet, Ce-doped CaMnO3, for which a giant topological Hall effect has been recently reported. We will also collaborate on interpretation of time-resolved optical pump-probe experiments by providing high accuracy steady-state spectroscopies on thin film systems, such as strained anisotropic NdNiO3.Further, we shall investigate magneto-optic phenomena in topological semimetals in bulk and thin film samples, for instance magnetic field dependence of giant magneto-optics response of Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, or temperature and field evolution of large Faraday rotation and anomalous Hall effect in magnetic semiconductors of EuCd2M2 family, (M=As, P, Sb) in bulk and thin films. Other systems of interest include van der Waals magnetic materials which exhibit variety of magnetic orders and magnon excitations will be explored as a function of temperature.The project funding requested will cover one senior researcher and one PhD student, necessary consumables, travel budged and small parts for 4 years.We expect to gain insight into the dynamics of the quantum materials in the form of thin films that is otherwise barely accessible and/or complementary to other spectroscopies (ARPES, STM, x-ray spectroscopies, confocal Raman). From a more general perspective, this work will bring forward the development of the infrared and THz ellipsometry and spectroscopic Hall effect methodology as characterization tool for novel materials in thin film form relevant for future microelectronics applications.",906889,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Understanding the Multi-Scale Interactions in Turbulent Flows of Astrophysical Relevance,"This award supports an effort to understand the complexities of turbulence in high energy density plasmas, a phenomenon with direct connections to many fields of science such as astrophysics and space physics. Turbulent astrophysical flows are observed to be cohesive across vast distances, and by mimicking similar plasma conditions in a laboratory this project aims to characterize plasma turbulence across different scales. The insights gained within the project may enhance technologies critical to national defense and energy security, such as nuclear stockpile stewardship, fusion energy development, and advanced propulsion systems. The project will also engage students from the University of Rochester and local high schools with predominantly underrepresented minority populations through an innovative outreach program. This program, modeled as an after-hours math club with role-playing elements, will foster practical problem-solving skills and mentorship. Plasma turbulence is known to lead to self-organized spinning flows and rapid transport across multiple scales. In astrophysical plasmas, electromagnetic fields mediate long-range interactions, maintaining cohesive flows across distances spanning light-years. This project aims to measure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent spectrum down to the viscous scale in a magnetized high energy density plasma created within the HADES pulsed power facility at the University of Rochester. Using advanced interferometry and imaging diagnostics, the project aims to correlate turbulent eddies across multiple scales and to evaluate the extension of turbulent scales by magnetic fields. Project's findings will allow theorists to validate MHD turbulence models and will help to better estimate the impact of turbulence on transport, including anomalous heat conduction, magnetic field diffusion, and stability conditions for flows with high Reynolds numbers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",904240,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Probing and controlling emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice materials,"Strongly frustrated insulating magnets have long been suspected to harbor quantum spin liquids (QSL) - exotic phases of matter with fractionalized excitations. While concrete theoretical models exist like the Kitaev honeycomb model, where such spin liquids are known to materialize, the challenge of finding a convincing experimental realization remains highly nontrivial and requires multi-technique approaches. A family of three-dimensional pyrochlore materials based on cerium and praseodymium, partly pioneered by the main applicant of this grant, have emerged as likely candidates for a three-dimensional QSL. These so-called quantum spin ice (QSI) materials have been theorized to mimic the properties of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) similar to our Universe, with both electric charge and light (photon) excitations. Intriguingly, magnetic monopoles that are absent (as far as we know) from our Universe also feature promptly in the theory of QSI. A single spin flip in such materials splits/fractionalizes into a pair of the emergent magnetic monopoles that wander around the crystal and should be ideally probed using inelastic neutron scattering, which is one of the main goals of the project. In rare-earth pyrochlores, correlated phases emerge from degrees of freedom that are Seff = 1/2 pseudo-spins of a spin-orbital-entangled ground-state doublet. The resulting degrees of freedom have different pseudo-spin components that can be magnetic and/or electric, dipoles or multipoles. QSI phases are predicted when a dominant ferro-coupling forms a manifold of ice states governed by a local ‘2-in-2-out’ constraint on each motif of the lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra, while weaker terms in the Hamiltonian endow the system with quantum dynamics.We request a PhD student and a postdoc with complementary skills, who will be able to work together and with the help and supervision of the main applicant. The PhD student will be dedicated to exploring the fine tuning of QSI phases through minute chemical defects and performing neutron scattering experiments including complex multi-parameter sample environments. The postdoc will focus on more challenging laboratory experiments at ultra-low temperatures using magnetic and electric fields to probe and control the emergent QED, which will require some developments at the start of the project. All the proposed scientific goals can be achieved at the PSI using the unique combination of large-scale research facilities, especially neutron scattering at SINQ, and new possibilities offered in view of the Quantum Matter and Materials Center. Dilution refrigerators are available, and we request funds for the fit out of a dedicated probe for the proposed bulk measurements as well as the necessary sensors and electronics.",901233,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Advance Knowledge and Understanding of Multi-Scale Phenomena in a Real Plasma,"This award enables continuation of an experimental exploration of eruptive plasma behavior in a laboratory under conditions similar to those on the sun and in other astrophysical objects. While laboratory plasmas have a much shorter lifetime than the solar and astrophysical plasmas, namely microseconds compared to anywhere from hours to millions of years for astrophysical plasmas, they can model many of the same phenomena in a reproducible and controllable fashion allowing for detailed studies. The present effort will focus on the study of the observed X-ray generation in a magnetized relatively cold plasma, under conditions when such high energy emission is not generally expected. This study has relevance to solar flares which similarly produce X-rays and very energetic particles that can damage spacecraft, and, in extreme cases, are associated with electric power grids disruptions. The project will also continue to engage a local high school with a vast majority of students from under-represented minority groups, motivating interest in science and encouraging them to pursue careers in plasma physics or other science and engineering fields. The ongoing research program is focused on determining how a seemingly benign, cold, collisional plasma can suddenly erupt and generate a burst of energetic particles, extreme ultra-violet radiation, hard X-rays, and high-frequency waves. In doing so, it contributes to the goals of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"" program. The knowledge and understanding being gained apply to many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, such as solar flares, astrophysical gamma ray bursts, X-ray bursts from terrestrial lightning, and dense plasma foci devices. The program employs a well-diagnosed laboratory device in which reproducible arched magnetized plasma structures in the shape of coronal loops are formed and then exhibit kink and Rayleigh-Taylor magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. A sequence of these instabilities pushes the plasma to a regime where the MHD approximation fails and non-MHD phenomena develop. This failure occurs when the electron velocity distribution becomes sufficiently non-thermal, with a significant population of highly energetic electrons leading to the generation of X-ray bursts. The continued investigation of these phenomena will employ high-speed visible and X-ray movie cameras, polarimetry to measure magnetic fields, and direct detection of energetic electrons.

WoU-MMA: Very-High-Energy Neutrino Observations with the Trinity Demonstrator Cherenkov Telescope,"This project will open one of the last unexplored windows on the Universe: the ultrahigh-energy neutrino window. It promises transformative impact, as detection of neutrinos at these extreme energies will answer some of the most profound questions in astroparticle physics and push the boundaries of our understanding of the Universe. This study will prove the concept for Trinity, a future experiment for air-shower imaging. This advanced neutrino instrument would greatly improve US research infrastructure in this field and help to maintain leadership. The award helps to create next-generation scientific leaders by introducing undergraduate students to frontier research, and by training graduate students and early-career postdoctoral scientists. The work will demonstrate the effectiveness of air-shower imaging with compact Cherenkov telescopes for VHE-UHE-neutrino detection. The Georgia-Tech group has installed and operates a small Cherenkov telescope, the Demonstrator, on Frisco Peak in Utah. The Demonstrator is the most sensitive operating air-shower imaging VHE-UHE-neutrino detector. It images the upward-going particle shower caused by a tau neutrino entering the Earth at a shallow angle and interacts to produce a tau that emerges from the ground and decays in the atmosphere. The technique is known as Earth-skimming. The project expects to: observe the first-ever VHE-UHE neutrinos, prove the long-term stability and reliability of the detection technique, demonstrate remote operation of the telescope, and study background events and advanced analysis techniques. This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.

Advancing Coherent XUV Light Generation: Harnessing High Harmonic Generation in Ultrafast Thin-Disk Lasers,"High Harmonic Generation (HHG) in gas targets has been a game-changer in modern physics, enabling coherent, laser-like radiation across ultraviolet to soft X-ray wavelengths. This has been instrumental in the advancement of attosecond science and a plethora of scientific applications. Enhancing flux and repetition rate of HHG systems can significantly improve measurement times, signal-to-noise ratios, and enable frequency comb metrology across the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV). Such enhancements will also have a profound impact on nanoscale imaging, providing promising alternatives to large-scale facilities like synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. High repetition rate HHG systems operating at high photon energies are starting to emerge as promising tools in material science, biology, and the silicon industry, especially in lithography mask inspection and semiconductor analysis for the 13.5-nm wavelength. This research project is designed to further explore and enhance the methodology of high-repetition rate HHG inside ultrafast thin-disk lasers (TDLs). Our goal is to augment the flux and establish the aptness of our system for rapid extreme ultraviolet nanoimaging and comb operation. The scope of the planned work will cover two major technological areas: mode-locked TDLs and high-flux, high-repetition-rate HHG studies.",889554,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
CAREER: Designing and Probing Emergent Phases with Tunable Magnons in Graphene,"Non-technical abstract Magnons are quantum mechanical, wave-like objects in magnetic materials that display fundamentally different characteristics than electrons. Harnessing magnons presents an intriguing avenue for creating synthetic matter not found in nature and developing next-generation quantum devices with unprecedented functionalities. While the properties of electrons have been intensively studied, the investigation of magnons and their collective behavior in solids remains extremely limited. A promising and tunable platform to explore this direction is graphene - a sheet of carbon atoms - placed in a strong magnetic field, where magnons can be efficiently launched and detected. The primary goal of this project is to explore the possible quantum phenomena that can be engineered by using magnons as building blocks and to investigate the feasibility of utilizing magnons to probe the magnetic properties of atomically thin materials. The success of this project promises to advance the frontier of fundamental quantum science and enable innovative pathways to future quantum technologies such as ultra-low-power information devices. This project also connects materials education with the growing societal demand for quantum technology through research-informed education and outreach programs for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Technical Abstract The exploration of correlated and topological states of charge-neutral bosons presents a compelling avenue for advancing our understanding of emergent phases of matter not found in nature and unlocking new opportunities in quantum technology. Magnons, also known as spin waves, in the quantum Hall ferromagnetic state of monolayer graphene, have recently emerged as a versatile solid-state platform for designing and probing emergent phases of bosons, owing to their extraordinary tunability, long lifetime, all-electrical generation and detection scheme and their remarkable sensitivity to the magnetic environment. However, our knowledge about the interaction between magnons and their coupling to the surrounding environments remains extremely limited. The project aims to experimentally address these key questions to facilitate future theoretical analysis and experimental development of emergent phases of magnons and a magnon-enabled spin probe. This investigation is made possible by leveraging recent advances in van der Waals assembly and moiré quantum matter, along with a creative combination of quantum electronic transport and scanning probe microscopy techniques to extract transport and thermodynamics properties of magnons in ultra-high-quality graphene heterostructures. Ultimately, this project provides a new pathway for the design, construction, characterization, and manipulation of correlated and topological phases of bosons in solids and establishes a new, generic, and effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in two-dimensional materials. In addition, this project has a broader impact through research and training opportunities in quantum science for undergraduates, graduate students, and high school teachers, and a new course on two-dimensional quantum materials.

Study of Exotic Matter,"The activities of our group focus on the low-energy/high-intensity particle physics frontier. The aim is to address open questions such as the origin of dark matter and the baryon anti-baryon asymmetry in the Universe.Exotic atoms as a probe of the Standard Model and beyond: A significant part of our research is dedicated to the study of the simplest exotic atoms: positronium (the e+e- bound state), muonium (µ+e-), and anti-hydrogen. These systems are an ideal benchmark to cross-check Bound-State Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and provide values of fundamental constants. To this aim, we developed novel methods for their production and are conducting the Mu-MASS experiment at PSI, for which the PI was awarded an ERC consolidator grant. Moreover, we use these systems for searches of new physics and to test fundamental symmetries. The PI is among the initial proposers of the GBAR experiment at CERN which aims to check the validity of the weak equivalence principle for anti-matter. The PI is responsible for the tracker to detect anti-hydrogen annihilations and proposed to measure the Lamb shift of anti-hydrogen in GBAR which will result in a stringent test of Lorentz/CPT symmetry and the determination of the anti-proton charge radius at a level of 10%.Dark Matter/Dark Sector: Dark Matter (DM) is still a great puzzle, and the understanding of its origin is of massive importance for Cosmology and (Astro-)Particle Physics. A leading candidate for the constituent of DM is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). However, so far despite the intensive searches at accelerators and direct detection experiments, no WIMP has been found. A class of interesting theoretical models introduces the concept of an extended Dark Sector (DS), in which DM is not only composed of a single particle but in which a complete set of dark particles with their own phenomenology is conjectured. This is becoming an extremely fertile domain of exploration, and so we are pioneering DS searches in fixed-target beam experiments at CERN. The PI is among the original proposers of the NA64 experiment at CERN searching for DS at the SPS. He participated in the review process and after its approval in 2016, was elected deputy spokesperson. Our group is responsible for the particle identification system comprising a spectrometer made of Micromegas trackers, combined with a bending magnet and the synchrotron radiation detector. Despite the experiment being quite new, very interesting results were rapidly achieved.This proposal is targeted toward the support of the activities of our Exotic Matter group at ETH Zurich and is the continuation of the ongoing SNSF grant 197346. The main results achieved during the last funding period and the goals set within the time frame of this new application are summarized below. The requested workforce is of utmost importance to fulfill our commitments in GBAR and NA64 and to grant the continuation of Mu-MASS. We include the fourth year salary for the 3 PhD students currently paid through the 197346 grant and the salary for 3 new PhD students and a post-doc (start date 01.01.2024 to ensure one year overlap for knowledge transfer). This funding would allow capitalizing on the main investments of the SNSF and the collaborations done in the past years achieving the physics goals and keeping very high visibility of our Swiss group in the experiments.The very intense NA64 program restarted in 2021 after the CERN long shutdown (LS2) with the installation of the upgraded setup in the new permanent experimental area that CERN allocated to us in the H4 SPS beamline (NA64e). The data taking was very successful and in 2022 the milestone of 1012 electrons on targets was achieved. This allows us to start probing the extremely interesting parameter space for thermal DM models suggested by the observed relic density. New results were published and the analysis of the new data is in progress. In 2021 and 2022, we performed two pilot runs in muon mode using the unique 160 GeV/c M2 beamline (NA64µ). The collected data demonstrate the potential of NA64µ to probe DS in a complementary way to the measurements with electrons and to address the (g - 2)µ anomaly. Our group at ETH is leading this effort and the new prospected PhD student would focus on the data taking and analysis of the upcoming physics runs (starting in 2024).GBAR started data-taking in 2021 when the ELENA ring became operational. In 2022, a major milestone for the experiment was achieved with the demonstration of anti-hydrogen production. This was presented for the first time in public at the Moriond conference by Mr. Blumer (the PhD student financed through 197346). The Lamb shift setup prepared by our group has been commissioned with hydrogen during 2021-2022. The first detection of anti-hydrogen in the 2S state will be attempted in late 2023 once the antihydrogen production is optimized. The main goals of GBAR before LS3 (end of 2025) are a measurement of the Lamb shift at the 100 ppm level and the production of antihydrogen ions required for a measurement of the effect of gravity on anti-matter at the 1% level.Mu-MASS at PSI focuses on studying the spectroscopic properties of Muonium (M). The experiment was proposed by the PI in 2019 (ERC consolidator grant 818053) and since then is running approximately 10 days/year at the PSI low energy muon (LEM) facility. After successfully demonstrating the production and detection of a 2S metastable M beam, the Mu-MASS collaboration could perform the first spectroscopic measurements of different transitions. Since the measured values match the theoretical calculations within one standard deviation, one could set stringent limits on Lorentz/CPT violation in the muonic sector, as well as on new physics coupled to muons and electrons. The requested personnel (1 PhD and 1 postdoc) in this application will allow the continuation of the experiment (the ERC grant ends in 2024) in order to reach the Mu-MASS goal of The requested personnel (1 PhD and 1 postdoc) in this application will allow the continuation of the experiment (the ERC grant ends in 2024) in order to reach the Mu-MASS goal of determining the muon mass to the 1 ppb level and providing, combined with MUSEUM at JPARC (Japan), one of the most stringent tests of bound state QED.",884304,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Upgrading the MKID Exoplanet Camera for Subaru SCExAO,"People from every nation, young or old, are filled with wonder at the night sky and invariably ask “Are We Alone?” We still don't know the answer! Over 5000 exoplanet detections have been confirmed in the last two decades, but finding a planet and knowing if it has life on it are very different things. To find life we need to go beyond the techniques that have allowed us to find these thousands of distant planets and develop instruments and techniques that let us detect the spectral features that are the signposts of life: oxygen, water vapor, methane, ozone, maybe even chlorophyll. In this project, the investigators will upgrade a powerful instrument for detecting and characterizing exoplanets called the MKID Exoplanet Camera. They have also started a YouTube channel, @ExperimentalAstrophysics, to show the world what it is like to design, fabricate, and use astronomical instruments. They will document their progress at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfhgvAdHDxXEzX0E8OX4c8A/ Over the last half decade, the investigators have constructed and operated the MKID Exoplanet Camera (MEC), a z through J band (800-1400 nm) Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) located behind the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) at the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea. MEC uses Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) as the enabling technology for high contrast imaging. MEC is the first permanently deployed near-infrared MKID instrument and is designed to operate both as an IFS and as a focal plane wavefront sensor in a multi-kHz feedback loop with SCExAO. MEC was designed nearly a decade ago using the best MKID technology of the time, but in subsequent years, the team has made significant MKID breakthroughs. Most notable is an improvement in the spectral resolution at 1 micron from R~5 to R~20 (R~35 at 400 nm) in recent lab measurements. This project will upgrade the MEC instrument to use this latest MKID technology, boosting the spectral resolution and array fill factor. This is especially timely as SCExAO has recently been upgraded to use a new 3000 actuator first stage deformable mirror (DM), which allows the full use of the 2000 actuator DM inside SCExAO for coherent differential imaging to reach unprecedented contrast levels at small inner working angles. Students will be a key part of the development program, helping to train the next generation of instrument PIs, and the team have also started a YouTube channel, @ExperimentalAstrophysics, to show the world what it is like to work in an Experimental Astrophysics lab. This channel will document the process of building and installing MEC’, and this work involves undergrads from UCSB's Film and Media studies department as editors.

High-Fidelity Lattice Systems of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules,"Some of the most intriguing quantum phenomena, such as high-temperature superconductivity and quantum magnetism, arise in materials where quantum particles interact over relatively long distances. Both high-temperature superconductivity – the property of certain materials to carry electrical power without loss – and quantum magnetism promise to revolutionize technology, from efficient energy distribution, new kinds of electronics, to quantum computing. However, the physical processes behind these phenomena are not well understood, hampering the targeted design of quantum materials for uses in tomorrow’s technology. In this research program the PI and his team will develop an experimental simulation system to help elucidating physical processes behind superconductivity and quantum magnetism. The new quantum simulator will rely on ultracold polar molecules that interact via long-range dipole-dipole interactions - akin to the long-range interactions between bar magnets, but in a quantum context. Having recently created the first Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of polar molecules, the research team has demonstrated the unique capability to prepare molecules deep in the quantum regime at temperatures of just a few billionth of a degree above absolute zero. By confining the polar molecules in optical lattices, artificial crystals made of laser light, the research team will carefully coax molecular systems to create and investigate new states of quantum matter. The research will be carried out by a diverse team of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. The students and postdocs will receive in-depth STEM education at the cutting edge of quantum science and technology, conveying the perspective that it is not only possible to observe quantum phenomena, but also to build complex quantum systems from bottom up. The project will help growing a uniquely skilled workforce, poised to develop technologies of the future. The team will also make broad efforts to widely disseminate the results in teaching and outreach activities, with a special emphasis on supporting URM students and broadening participation in STEM. Specifically, the PI and graduate students will realize high-fidelity lattice systems of ultracold dipolar molecules to unlock new possibilities for many-body quantum physics, quantum simulation, and quantum computing. Starting from a BEC of sodium-cesium molecules, the PI and the research team will prepare polar molecules in optical lattices with a controlled filling, including unity filling. This setup will enable the realization and investigation of extended Hubbard models and models for quantum magnetism in parameter regimes that have not been accessible with other approaches. Molecular BECs and their ability to realize highly controlled systems of strongly dipolar quantum matter promise important insights into the principles of self-organization of matter.

Frequency conversion in engineered and optically controllable nonlinear Si-photonics microresonators,"An ever-increasing number of demanding photonic applications rely on light generation and manipulation over the entire spectrum, from UV to middle infrared. The generation of coherent visible/near-visible (VIS/near-VIS) light is of interest for quantum optics, metrology, or applications in biology and spectroscopy to name a few. Miniaturizing such sources to the chip level is essential for scalable manufacturing and large-scale deployment. While a direct solution is the development of integrated lasers leveraging III-V semiconductors, their spectral coverage remains restricted to gain media properties. Nonlinear frequency conversion of light, through third- or second-order effects, is a resourceful approach to couple power from an initial laser to new frequencies, that in addition to providing a precise transfer of light properties allows for coherent conversion linking distant spectral windows. Nanophotonic devices are in that regard compelling, owing to tight light confinement in nano-scale structures and lithographic fabrication precision, required for the control of dispersion. However, while tremendous work has been done in the near-IR, on-chip coherent nonlinear translation bridging to the VIS/near-VIS is still in its early stage of development. While second-order nonlinearity (x(2)) has long been exploited in bulk media and tabletop systems for far detuned conversion, it is challenging to exploit at the chip scale, and most particularly so in silicon (Si) photonics which lacks intrinsic x(2).  The proposed project thus aims at further developing nonlinear conversion of spectrally distant coherent beams in engineered high-Q x(2) microresonators. This project aims to answer a critical challenge of resonant x(2) integrated photonics: the need for momentum conservation means that the interacting azimuthal modes inside the microresonators must satisfy stringent conditions, very sensitive to fabrication tolerances, a barrier for large scale development. With this project we will leverage new ways of inducing nonlinearity and new designs, to provide some leeway from fabrication constraints. At the heart of the project lies the in-depth study of photo-induced nonlinearities in microresonators, to efficiently and with versatility bring x(2) to Si platform, and the engineering of optimized structures for the demonstration of versatile second-harmonic and non-classical state of light sources.The first main line of research is on the demonstration of efficient tunable frequency doublers using silicon nitride (SiN) microresonators. Relying on our expertise on photoinduced nonlinearities and nonlinear building block designs, the project will explore the engineering aspects of optimized SiN single microresonator structures. This first requires developing a complete map of operation, lower operational threshold, increase efficiencies and probe operational limits down to the VIS. The final goal is the demonstration of a compact electrically-driven hybrid InP-SiN injection locked dual-wavelength source, coherently bridging near-vis and near-IR. A complementing line of research is on the design of photonic molecules, i.e. coupled microresonators. More specifically, we will exploit the added degrees of freedom in the control of photoinduced nonlinearities to enhance the operation and tunability of the frequency conversion. In this timely line of research, the proposed work will explore the potential of decoupling the linear properties of the pump and its frequency converted component. Our particular focus will be on the study and design of a Si photonics-based system for not only up-conversion, but also down-conversion to the near IR resulting in a simple integrated source of quantum states. This project thus targets critical challenges, engineering and fundamental, of resonant x(2) integrated optics, and extend frequency conversion in microresonators from benchtop testbeds to packaged turnkey devices.",862793,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Collaborative Research: Time Domain Studies of Supermassive Black Holes,"This project seeks to address how supermassive black holes (SMBH) form in the early universe and how they create relativistic jets. The investigators will study two families of SMBHs that are very rare to determine the number of binary SMBHs. They will determine whether the recently discovered gravitational wave background is due to these objects. One early result from the James Webb Space Telescope is that there are far more binary supermassive black holes in the early universe than expected. The existence of so many binary supermassive black holes poses challenges to cosmology. The PIs will use the 40 m telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and the Very Long Baseline Array to study the structure of these objects. The PIs will combine the radio results with optical, infrared, X-ray, Gamma-ray, and gravitational wave observations. The work will be carried out by five graduate students, so this will be important of their career development. In addition, the PIs have started an outreach program, in which they will be studying the jets in these objects, with schools that work with students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The radio jets from SMBHs will be studied in great detail through their varying radio brightness and structure on the scale of light years. One rare class the PIs will study is SMBH Binaries (SMBHBs). About 1 in 100 radio jets is a SMBHB. The PIs have detected two convincing SMBHB candidates through their light curves. Their focused search should at least double the number of strong candidates. Each strong candidate is of great importance to multi-messenger astrophysics, since the SMBHBs produce gravitational waves that will in future be detectable by pulsar timing arrays. They will also study high-luminosity compact symmetric objects (CSOs). The brightest CSOs die out after ~5000 years, whereas most radio jets last up to tens of millions of years, suggesting that a different fueling mechanism drives the brightest CSOs. Astronomers think this is the capture of single stars by the SMBH in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The PI's will test whether these powerful CSOs really do die out at ~5000 years. By studying these two rare classes, each of which probes details of the central engines in a unique way, they will gain crucial insights into the jet formation and launching mechanism as well as into the SMBHs themselves. Most importantly - if the initial results on CSOs are confirmed in this study, then the smallest CSOs will evolve on timescales of a few years. This will make possible the direct testing of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic theory and simulations of relativistic jets.

"Collaborative Research: The Multimessenger Treasure TROVE, a Tool for Rapid Object Vetting and Examination","This award combines novel detections of gravity waves and particles with traditional astronomy observations to better understand the physics of merging black holes and neutron stars. This way of exploring the universe is powerful but presents challenges. Often the direction and origin of the merger is uncertain, and astronomers must search large areas of the sky to identify any explosions that may be related. Response time is also important, as any astronomical signal may only last for hours and may be confused with many unrelated sources in the night sky. To address this challenge, a team led by the University of Arizona and Northwestern University will develop a tool that uses data archives and real-time observations to help astronomers assess incoming candidate counterparts to gravity wave and neutrino events. This product will lower the barrier to enter this exciting field and bring together communities including high schools, smaller institutions and amateur astronomers. This award will fund scholarships for high school students to conduct related research. The team will build the Treasure TROVE (a Tool for Rapid Object Vetting and Examination), which will use the vast stores of information in astronomical archives and real-time searches for supernovae to help multi-messenger astronomers assess and prioritize incoming candidate counterparts to gravitational wave events and neutrinos. For each candidate transient counterpart to a gravitational wave or particle messenger, the Treasure TROVE will crossmatch it with galaxy catalogs, archival imaging, and other public archives to determine whether the distance, variability, and association with other types of transients is consistent with the messenger. This will allow for ~50% of candidates to be discarded without any further need of follow-up, and for the most promising candidates to be prioritized. This program will involve community engagement, providing workshops, tutorials, and public workspaces that will ensure the broadest possible community can use the Treasure TROVE and participate in multi-messenger astronomy. Multi-messenger event localizations can span 1-1000s square degrees on the sky, and follow-up electromagnetic observations can uncover tens to hundreds of transients within that region - only one of which can be related to the gravitational wave, neutrino, or high-energy particle alert. The Treasure TROVE tool will take basic information of recent transients and automatically place each object in context using historical light curves and host galaxy identification, along with cross-matching with image archives and multiple point source, variable, and quasar catalogs. The Treasure TROVE will simplify this task with an easy-to-use software and web interface, optimizing follow-up telescope resources and speeding discovery.

Probing and engineering cavity-mediated vacuum field interactions,"While the effect of vacuum field fluctuations on the atomic levels has been well established since many years, some of its fundamental properties as well as its relevance for solid state physics remain a topic of active research. Indeed, the energy that characterizes the light to matter coupling of atomic physics can be enhanced in solid state systems by many order of magnitudes by the large size and density of collective electronic excitations coupled to a suitable optical resonator. For this reason, there is a strong interest in exploring to which extent engineered vacuum fluctuations are able to control electronic phases in solids, in our case by using Landau polaritons as the material platform. Additionally, novel techniques have now enabled the measurement of vacuum fluctuations directly and therefore go a long way towards probing experimentally some of the still poorly understood aspects. Globally, the project aims at answering three fundamental questions: • Can we harvest entanglement from vacuum?• Are there radiative corrections to the quantum Hall resistance?• Can we uncover experimental signatures of cavity-driven quantum phase transitions? These questions will be addressed using the following approaches. Demonstrate entanglement harvesting in vacuum: Using an electro-optic sampling experiment, we have recently measured vacuum field correlations between two points that are not causally connected. In addition, we have also introduced a new type of generalised ellipsometry correlation experiments that investigates different quadratures of the field and which we used to individually probe vacuum field fluctuations and source radiation terms. Leveraging on these achievements, we want to implement a theoretical proposal to demonstrate entanglement harvesting from vacuum. Cavity-mediated hopping interactions in magneto-transport: With our recent measurements we have demonstrated that vacuum fluctuations are able to break the topological protection of the integer quantum Hall effect, through a mechanism described as an anti-resonant cavity-mediated hopping. We want to study this interaction in more detail by investigating the following topics: •Recent theoretical works have predicted small but measurable deviations from perfect quantization arising at finite and even at zero temperature caused by the radiative lifetime of polariton states. We will investigate the existence of such deviations by an in-situ comparison between cavity and reference samples using a Wheatstone bridge geometry. •We aim at studying and elucidating the effect of this new long-range coupling on electron-electron inter- actions in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We want first to experimentally study how the various Laughlin gaps are enhanced or quenched as a cavity is positioned in close proximity of the Hall bar. •We will also perform the same experiment on a bilayer system that exhibits an exciton condensation, enabling to study how the coupling to a resonant cavity can modify the phase transition. Measuring transport in cavities breaking the time-reversal symmetry: We would like to follow up on our development of cavities that break time-reversal symmetry. Leveraging on our recently demonstrated antenna- based cavities, we want to also explore monolithic cavities incorporating Faraday mirrors. One important goal is to measure the quantum Hall transport in electron gases embedded in such cavities. The project is a continuation of a previous SNF project, lasts 36 months and will be carried out at ETH Zurich. The total requested funding for three years amounts to CHF 748’000.",842298,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Imaging Habitable-Zone Exoplanets With a Quadruple Annular Groove Phase Mask Coronagraph,"A major goal of modern astronomy is the detection of Earth-like exoplanets. To do this, it is necessary to block the light from the central star so that any planets are not lost in the glare. Blocking out this central bright star is a significant challenge that must be met in order to find and study faint Earth-like planets. This investigation will contribute toward this goal by developing a new type of coronagraph, a special device for blocking the starlight, for mid-infrared instruments. The investigators will demonstrate this new technology through a first-of-its-kind observation of a nearby star that could lead to the discovery of new exoplanets. This program will more broadly impact society through student research and education opportunities. In addition, the investigators will help to develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by hosting a workshop on the technique of coronagraphy, and promoting the full participation of women, disabled persons, and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through teaching and inclusive educational programs. This project will result in the manufacture and commissioning of a new type of coronagraph for mid-infrared exoplanet imaging observations: the Quadruple Annular Groove Phase Mask (Q-AGPM). The Q-AGPM builds on the successful design of the classical AGPM. The quadruple-etched design in a single unit will enable the nulling power of the typical AGPM design to be combined with multiple beams and/or multiple beam positions to mitigate the mid-IR background through differential imaging. The investigators anticipate a Q-AGPM equipped 8m telescope to be two and a half times more sensitive–covering an estimated ~60% of the current gap between imaging warm sub-Neptunes and super-Earths around the closest stars. They will demonstrate this gain in sensitivity by conducting a test observation. In a one week campaign (approximately three to six nights, depending on weather), the team will demonstrate the sensitivity of a single-target long exposure, which could lead to the discovery of new exoplanets. This program will more broadly impact the community by creating student research opportunities and by hosting a workshop for advanced undergraduate and graduate students that will focus on the history, modern designs, and important scientific results of coronagraphy.

WoU-MMA Particle and Gamma-Ray Astrophysics with VERITAS and CTA: Understanding the Nature of Cosmic Accelerators,"Gamma ray telescopes explore the Universe at the highest energies, offering a stunning view of cosmic phenomena that occur only under extreme physical conditions.

Surface NMR spectroscopy on a diamond sensor platform,"Understanding molecular interactions and processes on surfaces and at interfaces is important for a variety of chemical, physical and biological processes. One of the most powerful techniques for such analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, is challenging to apply to surface or interface phenomena because of a limited signal-to-noise ratio: since at least 1e12-1e18 nuclear spins are needed to generate a detectable signal, not enough surface area is available within the detection coil of an NMR spectrometer. Therefore, NMR is typically confined to “volumes” of samples unless systems (like nanoparticles) with an enormous surface-to-volume ratio are available.In this SNSF grant application, we propose to explore sub-surface electron spins in diamond (single nitrogen-vacancy centers) as sensitive detectors for surface NMR with sub-nanometer resolution and single-spin sensitivity. In a first part of the project, we will develop the experimental means for performing surface NMR measurements, including a sample chamber allowing for full chemical control over the surface, as well as multi-channel optical and microwave hardware for improved spin readout and advanced nuclear and electronic spin manipulation. In a second part of the project, we will focus on three model applications of the diamond surface platform: (i) dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of surface nuclear spins, (ii) investigation of surface dynamics, including spin and molecular diffusion, surface reactions, and molecular binding, and (iii) structural imaging of surface molecules towards single-atom resolution. Together, our experiments will establish a powerful, versatile and well-controlled testbed platform for studying surface spin dynamics and surface NMR at the single-molecule level.Our project is interdisciplinary in both its experimental and conceptual approach, and if successful, will stimulate further work in several scientific directions: examples are the study of spin dynamics and spin networks in quantum physics, the investigation of surface binding in chemistry and biology (complementing existing techniques such as photo-electron spectroscopy), fundamental aspects to NMR and EPR spectroscopy, and on the long term, as a possible tool for molecular structure analysis. The proposal will allow us to establish a strong research program in surface chemistry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complementing our existing efforts in condensed matter physics and scanning probe microscopy.",828515,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Chemical Sciences; Quantum Physics
Towards QCD at Large Quantum Number,"Understanding strongly coupled models is one of the big challenges of contemporary theoretical physics. These systems are ubiquitous, arising both in the formal study of general QFT, e.g. at the interacting conformal fixed points of RG flows, and in the Standard Model of particle physics which describes the interactions of the elementary constituents of matter. While numerical modeling is often well-adapted to strongly interacting systems, their analytic study is much more difficult.The large-charge expansion, proposed in 2015 by my co-authors and myself, is an approach that allows the analytic study of strongly-coupled systems. In the last eight years, this method has seen many successes: working in sectors of large charge leads to important simplifications in many models at strong coupling, allowing the analytic computation of various observables. Most of the existing work has dealt with bosonic models, such as the O(N) vector model, or supersymmetric models, where a lot of progress has been achieved. Moreover, the bulk of the previous large-charge literature deals with models at criticality, i.e. at the conformal point.Now is the moment to adapt the large-charge approach to more realistic models. This is the task I aim to undertake in the proposed project. My long-term goal is the description of QCD at high density or high baryon number, regimes allowing the theoretical description of objects such as neutron star interiors. This project aims to lay the groundwork for the first steps in this direction.Project objectives:QCD, differently from the models which have been well-understood at large charge, is a gauge theory with fermionic matter. In order to be able to apply the large-charge expansion to it, some necessary building blocks need to be acquired first. The two main objectives of my proposed research are:- I. Understanding the large-charge expansion of fermionic theories.First forays into this direction have been made recently, both by my group and others, but many open questions remain. We need to understand under which circumstances a superfluid-type condensate arises at and how to formulate an EFT at large charge at the Fermi surface.- II. Understanding gauge theories at large charge. The application of the large-charge expansion to gauge theories is a challenge as, first of all, the right gauge-invariant quantities - which are in general non-local operators - need to be identified. Once the initial technical and conceptual challenges have been overcome, applications to color-flavor locked phases and the conformal window of QCD move into reach.Novel aspects and impact:The large-charge expansion has already shown its power by generating results for previously analytically inaccessible strongly-coupled models, sparking interest in a variety of communities, such as formal high-energy theory, high-energy phenomenology, lattice field theory and critical phenomena. Extending the reach of this approach towards theories which have the capability of capturing real-life physical phenomena is a crucial step. This project aims to make a new class of theories accessible to a powerful analytic method, generating important new results in an area of theoretical physics directly relevant to modern-day experiments and our understanding of the fundamental interactions as a whole.",821760,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
CAREER: RACING -- Resolving the Activity Cycle In the Nearest Galaxies,"Principal Investigator (PI) Mills and her team will investigate how super-massive black holes are fed and how stars form in the innermost regions of nearby galaxies.

Students will participate in a remote summer research group project and will be mentored throughout their senior year to ensure a smooth transition to a PhD program. Using a combination of data from ALMA, the VLA, and the James Webb Space Telescope the team will characterize, at the parsec-scale, which physical properties of a galaxy’s central gas and dust reservoir are correlated with central star formation and black hole activity to advance our understanding of the duty cycles of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and central starbursts.

Asteroseismology of transport processes for the evolution of stars and planets,"Stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of our Universe, as sources of radiation, as dynamical engines through their explosions, and as chemical factories to produce the elements necessary for life. Consequently, results from stellar models are central to studies in contemporary physical sciences, from exoplanetary to cosmological research. Stellar physics links fundamental physical aspects to hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic processes, and the validity of stellar models depends directly on our understanding of these complex physical mechanisms. Progress in modelling these processes requires direct observational constraints on the physical properties of stellar interiors. This is now possible thanks to the unique ability of asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, to probe the internal structure and dynamics of stars. Asteroseismology has recently undergone a rapid development with the space missions CoRoT, Kepler, TESS and the future PLATO mission (ESA to be launched in 2026). These asteroseismic measurements have revealed a major shortcoming in stellar physics: the current generation of stellar models cannot account for the internal rotation of stars as determined by asteroseismology. This highlights our poor understanding of the dynamical processes at work in stellar interiors, which has important implications for stellar evolution in general. Indeed, angular momentum plays a central role in the evolution of stars at all stages and for all masses. Incorrect modelling of angular momentum transport implies that all the results of stellar models are uncertain (e.g. lifetimes, chemical mixing, effect of rotation on luminosities and effective temperatures, angular momentum of the core at the time of collapse, stellar yields). Determining the physical nature of this (or these) missing angular momentum transport process(es) is a key challenge in stellar physics, and will be the first objective of the present proposal. This will be addressed by the development of rotating models that incorporate new theoretical prescriptions for angular momentum transport through both hydrodynamic and magnetic instabilities, and by a thorough comparison of the predictions of these models with asteroseismic determinations of internal rotation for stars of different masses and evolutionary stages. The transport of chemicals in stellar interiors is naturally linked to the transport of angular momentum through the different instabilities that can be activated by rotation and magnetic fields. The second goal of the project is therefore to obtain rotating models that can reproduce in a consistent and physically motivated way the observational constraints available for chemical elements in addition to internal rotation. Large grids of models based on these theoretical developments will then be computed to study the consequences of this new generation of rotating models on key stellar properties at different metallicities. These grids, together with the new version of our stellar evolution code that will be developed during this project, will be made easily available to the community through online tools to predict the radiative, mechanical, and chemical feedback of stars in galaxies throughout cosmic history. Finally, these new models with rotation and magnetic fields will be used in the context of star-planet interactions to constrain tidal dissipation in both the host star and the planets, and to investigate the key influence of the rotational history of the host star on the atmospheric evaporation of the planets. The third objective of this proposal is to develop a new theoretical framework for studying the global evolution of planetary systems, based on self-consistent modelling of the rotational and magnetic properties of the host star and their impact on the atmospheric and orbital properties of the planets. The present project will thus lead to important scientific results, while providing the community with the outputs of a new generation of rotating models and the corresponding version of our Geneva stellar evolution code (GENEC).",819055,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
A new generation of ionic gated devices,"We have recently developed a technique that allows the realization of high-quality ionic gated transistors in a back-gate configuration. This technique enables new types of experiments on 2D materials, with independent control of accumulated carrier density and applied perpendicular electric field, over ranges that vastly exceed what is achievable with conventional gating techniques. The goal of this project is to exploit these technical developments, to explore new electronic phenomena in single and double ionic gate devices based on 2D materials. Quenching the band gap of 2D semiconductors. We will use double ionic gated devices to investigate the nature of the electronic state that emerges in 2D semiconductors with large spin-orbit interaction, when their band-gap is quenched by the application of a perpendicular electric field. The closure of the band gap -and its subsequent reopening because of either spin-orbit or Coulomb interaction- can controllably induce a transition from a band to a topological or to an excitonic insulator. If both spin-orbit and Coulomb interaction are present the interplay of the two phenomena can give rise to many possible electronic states, as recent theoretical works predict. We will search for these states in double ionic gated bi/few layer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their vdW interfaces, in which we have recently succeeded in quenching the gap with a perpendicular electric field. Experiments will rely on temperature-dependent transport experiments (performed in different configurations, as a function of accumulated electron/hole density, of applied electric field, and of magnetic field), and will first search for manifestations of topological and excitonic insulating behaviour, which will be subsequently explored in full detail. Because the 2D semiconducting TMDs form a broad family of similar systems with different parameters, comparative studies of different materials can give access to distinct physical regimes, and will facilitate the interpretation in terms of microscopic theoretical models.Probing the gate-induced superconducting state in TMDs. We will investigate the nature of the gate-induced superconducting state in TMDs under strong electron accumulation. Existing experiments indicate that superconductivity is unconventional -with a large subgap density of states (DOS)- but the specific state is unknown. Through an ongoing theoretical analysis with collaborators we have identified a multi-valley s+- state as a realistic scenario that we can now test experimentally. To this end, we will employ tunnel junctions that can now be realized in ionic back-gated devices, and perform tunnelling spectroscopy and supercurrent measurements. Tunneling spectroscopy will have three main objectives: i) compare different TMDs, to understand if the subgap DOS observed in MoS2 is present in all compounds; ii) search for subgap states at sharply defined energies; iii) detect the systematic presence of multiple gaps. In junctions with superconducting electrodes, we will focus on the magnetic field dependence of the Jospehson supercurrent, which for s+- superconductor can exhibit multiple regimes. The measurements of normal and superconducting tunnelling currents will provide experimental indications to validate the s+- scenario or disprove it, in which case we will analyze the experimental results to extract indications for other possible states.Our project explores outstanding questions and electronic phenomena, which can be addressed only now, because of developments in ionic gating that have been reported during the last 12 months. Many aspects of the physical problems that we will investigate are therefore uncharted territory. As such, the proposed research has a pronounced explorative, fundamental character, with great potential to make new, unexpected observations and discoveries.",816261,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
CAREER: Photo-induced Ultrafast Electron-nuclear Dynamics in Molecules,"General audience abstract: When a molecule is subject to a sudden disturbance, such as the removal of one or more electrons, the remaining electrons and atomic nuclei move. In many cases, one can assume that the light electrons adapt themselves instantly to the positions of the much heavier atomic nuclei as the molecule changes shape (the “Born-Oppenheimer approximation”), but this is only approximately true. The electrons, which exhibit both wave and particle aspects, can interfere with each other. The resulting electron wavepackets can oscillate rapidly compared to the motion of the atomic nuclei. Such “electron coherences” are thought to be important in chemical and biological processes such as vision but have been difficult to study due to the extremely short timescales on which they evolve (a few attoseconds, where one attosecond = 0.000000000000000001 seconds). This extremely fast electron motion will be affected by the comparatively slower motion of the atomic nuclei. The PI and her research team will use state-of-the-art lasers and photon sources on the campus of the University of Central Florida to study the evolution of these electron coherences and their coupling to the underlying nuclear motions. Ultimately such studies may advance our ability to engineer reaction products and optimize energy harvesting. This CAREER award supports undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who will be trained in the use of state-of-the-art laser systems and associated advanced spectroscopic techniques. In addition, the award supports an educational and outreach project which includes a summer program focusing on instrumentation training for students, an introductory video sequence on ultrafast science addressing a broader audience, and events for high-school teachers and students, called “Go Ultrafast!” Technical audience abstract: When coherent light interacts with a molecule, multiple electronic states can be populated with specific relative phases, resulting in electronic coherences. In this project, the evolution of these electronic coherences will be time-resolved in a pump-probe scheme with temporal resolutions at the natural time scales of the electron and ion motion. The effect of electron-nuclear coupling on the electronic-coherence properties, such as their lengths, strengths, and revivals, will be investigated. Femtosecond infrared/near-infrared lasers and attosecond XUV/x-ray table-top light sources will be used as the pump or the probe.

BSM-PM: Rare Event Searches at MIT,"This proposal addresses two of the most fundamental questions in nuclear and particle physics: the nature of dark matter and the origin of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry - why does it appear the universe is matter dominated? Axions are a well-motivated candidate for dark matter, while possible Majorana neutrinos are potential sources of matter-antimatter asymmetry. The project will conduct specialized experiments using precision measurement techniques to search for axion dark matter through the DMRadio program and for Majorana neutrinos through the CUPID neutrinoless double-beta decay program. The technical goal is to develop robust quantum-enhanced superconducting readout systems for both initiatives. Additionally, the PI and her team will leverage data from these experiments to create advanced algorithms, including AI and machine learning techniques, to reduce noise. For the DMRadio program, the project will develop real-time SQUID optimization software for frequency scans. For the CUPID program, the project will create a robust multiplexed readout system for TES sensors based on technology developed by NIST.

This project aims at developing such frontier quantum research activities and expanding the quantum education and talent training capacity at North Carolina triad and triangle regions through close collaboration between North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The project investigates optimized high-frequency signals produced collectively from microwave and magnetic samples, and efficient ways to process and interconvert them for electronic applications. The project includes a research and education plan to involve graduate and undergraduate researchers at both institutions, especially students from minority groups. The research activities are also complemented by rich outreach activities to engage with students from local high schools and community colleges, and dissemination plans to share the research findings with the public research community. Technical Abstract: Spin wave(magnon)-based hybrid quantum systems manifest several advantages including low energy loss, novel quantum states, small wavelength, and compatibility with memory architectures. In the past decade, different hybrid magnon-photon coupling systems have been proposed by interacting microwave cavities and transmission line resonators with ferrimagnetic materials to achieve quantum logics, sensing and signal transduction. In this project, an applied physics and engineering approach is taken to develop novel microwave photon-magnon coupling systems based on engineered subwavelength photon resonators and mode-tailored magnon cavities. The project addresses several intellectual challenges: 1) developing novel sub-wavelength microwave photon resonators and periodic waveguiding structures through photon mode engineering for hybrid magnonics systems and their characterization at ambient temperatures; 2) down-scaling of magnon wavelength through research of novel magnonic resonant cavity architectures and excitation of short wavelength magnon modes; 3) developing on-chip, non-reciprocal photon-magnon coupling systems for unidirectional signal transduction through both selectively polarized photon engineering and non-reciprocal properties of magnon-magnon coupling. The project strides a multi-disciplinary research path for quantum system development, and the insights gained from the research have the potential to catalyze advancements in various applications, including spin-based logic and memory devices, magnon-based signal processing, and quantum sensing and information processing.

The strategic emphasis lies in creating internships that blend educational elements with laboratory research, producing STEM graduates with unique skill sets who reflect the nation's diversity. The project offers students various opportunities to connect with local quantum communities through collaborative research projects, internships, and entrepreneurial ventures. Technical Description: The research objective of this project is to develop electrically tunable persistent spin helixes (PSH) and understand their exchange interactions with defect spin qubits as a novel method for quantum information processing. The research team from Hunter College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and University of Maryland pursues a spin defect qubit system that features both long coherence times and electrically tunable coupling between qubits. The collaborative research team explores the epitaxial growth of model cubic materials in quantum wells with specific crystallographic orientations and use electric fields to induce PSH. The team combines optical spectroscopy with electrical transport measurements to understand the spin dynamics of PSH, single qubits, and the exchange interactions between qubits mediated by PSH.

ExpandQISE: Track 1: First- Principles Calculation of Quantum Defects via the Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation Approach,"Solid materials inevitably have defects such as missing atoms and impurities of a different kind of atom. These defects can have discrete energy levels like an individual atom, providing quantum states which can be used for applications in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications. This project uses computational theory to understand the fundamental properties of such defects and identify promising candidates to be studied in the laboratory and considered for future technologies. The research team is developing a new methodology and applying it to a novel class of defects to assess their suitability. The methods developed are being implemented in open-source software, available for the research community at large, and made accessible via tutorials and workshops. The postdoctoral researchers and students are being trained in best practices for code development. The research benefits society and economic development by building the fundamental scientific knowledge for the advancement of quantum technologies. This project brings together faculty members from the University of California, Merced (UC Merced), Florida Polytechnic University, and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara) which has a well-established research program including the NSF-funded Quantum Foundry. The research team is adapting course modules from UC Santa Barbara on Materials for Quantum Information Science for classes at UC Merced and Florida Polytechnic and developing new hands-on web-based simulation tools and exercises about defects. Undergraduates at UC Merced and Florida Polytechnic will take part in the research. UC Merced students will join Quantum Foundry professional development activities, including student-led seminars and engagement with industry through industry internships and the annual Quantum Industry Showcase. An additional element is public outreach with the California Minerals and Mining Museum about how defects create colors in gemstones. The continued development of quantum information science depends on identifying suitable qubits, single-photon emitters, and quantum memories. Point defects or impurities in semiconductors and insulators form an attractive platform for implementing these technologies. Theory can play an important role in identifying suitable new candidates for experimental investigation. However, accurate calculations of defect properties are quite challenging for standard electronic-structure methods. The research team’s recently developed spin-flip Bethe-Salpeter equation approach to this problem has shown success on small molecules and on the NV− and SiV0 centers in diamond. This project is further developing the spin-flip Bethe-Salpeter equation method, to make it more accurate and flexible. The method is then being applied to transition-metal impurities in wide-band-gap semiconductors or insulators, which are a primary target of interest in the field, in order to calculate optical spectra and radiative and non-radiative recombination. The research team brings together expertise specifically in the spin-flip Bethe-Salpeter method from junior investigators at UC Merced and Florida Polytechnic, with expertise in first-principles calculations of defects and recombination processes from a more senior investigator at UC Santa Barbara, to develop research and education in quantum information science at these two emerging institutions. This work advances the spin-flip Bethe-Salpeter methodology and code, providing a new tool for the quantum information science research community to use in first-principles studies of point defects, which overcomes the limitations of some existing methods.

BSM-PM: Novel Experimental Techniques for Neutrino Physics,"Neutrino physics continues to provide a wealth of opportunities for discovery and a deeper understanding of the underpinnings of the Standard Model of particle physics. This work tackles two fundamental questions related to neutrino physics: the neutrino mass and how neutrinos coherently interact with matter. The answers to both these questions remain incomplete despite almost seventy years of the neutrino being discovered. To this day, the absolute mass scale remains experimentally unknown. A discovery of the neutrino mass scale would profoundly impact the field of nuclear physics. Likewise, how neutrinos interact coherently with matter at low momentum transfers remains unexplored and could reveal new clues about physics beyond the Standard Model. The Neutrino and Dark Matter Group at MIT strives to explore the answers to both of these questions using high-precision techniques aimed at measuring the fundamental properties of neutrinos. For measuring the neutrino mass scale, we will continue to lead the Project 8 neutrino experiment, which uses the technique of cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, or CRES, to measure the endpoint spectrum of tritium beta decay. Project 8 aims to construct a next-generation tritium beta decay experiment with a final neutrino mass sensitivity of 40 meV/c2, and over the next few years, will construct the next prototype experiment (Phase III) to demonstrate the scalability of the technique. For the second question, the Neutrino and Dark Matter group will spearhead the Ricochet neutrino experiment. Ricochet uses a combination of Germanium and metallic superconductors to measure coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) from neutrinos created by fission. The use of metallic superconducting bolometers for recoil detection also has a broad reach, having potential applications in nuclear reactor monitoring and direct dark matter detection. Both of these experiments (Ricochet and Project 8) utilize high-precision techniques that operate near the quantum limit of sensitivity. Therefore, a portion of this research will also be devoted to developing high-temperature traveling wave parametric amplifiers, which we plan to use for neutrino physics and other future cryogenic sensor arrays.

ExpandQISE: Track 1: Quantum Correlations in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms and Their Implementation,"As quantum computing hardware develops, exploring practical applications of near-term quantum devices has attracted an increasing interest. This Expanding Capacity in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (ExpandQISE) project supports research that explores the fundamental theory of the potential of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving complex optimization problems and their implementation in near-term quantum devices. The project also develops an undergraduate quantum computing course for STEM students with diverse backgrounds to enter the field. Through these research and education activities, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students are trained in quantum computing for the quantum workforce needs of industry, government, and academia. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), emerge as a potential tool for solving complex problems. However, no speedup of these algorithms over classical algorithms for any practically relevant tasks have been demonstrated. Quantum entanglement, on the other hand, is considered a resource for quantum computing to go beyond classical computing. However, the role of entanglement in quantum-classical algorithms is subtle. In this project, the research team focuses on the role of quantum correlations, including multipartite entanglement and spin squeezing, to investigate the theory and performance of algorithms based on QAOA. The Principal Investigator will leverage the direct access to IBM Quantum Computers at the University of Rhode Island and the expertise and experience of the Co-Principal Investigator and the collaborators in the fields of quantum computing and quantum algorithms to explore 1) theoretical analysis of the performance of low depth QAOA under different variations, including initial entangled states and entangling mixing operators, 2) numerical simulation of the new variations in QAOA using high-performance computers, and 3) experimental implementation of these new QAOA variations on large quantum computing devices with tens of qubits.

The project, led by the University of North Dakota (UND), leverages UND’s new cleanroom facilities to establish expertise in optical thin films and device fabrication, while partnering with the University of Oregon (UO) to benefit from its expertise in characterizing quantum light sources and its strong track record in QISE education. This partnership strengthens existing efforts to recruit, retain, and graduate undergraduate and graduate participants from underrepresented groups in STEM while establishing a framework to train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers. Sources of entangled photon pairs and single photons are critical elements of QISE. To advance the state of the art in sources of entangled photon pairs and heralded single photons based on spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the project focuses on a narrowband, frequency-multiplexed source of photon pairs based on cavity-enhanced SPDC. The semi-integrated design, where nonlinear bulk crystals are combined with dielectric thin film coatings fabricated in-house at UND, can be deployed in relevant environments for telecommunication and sensing. Multiplexing the source across multiple spectral bins addresses the fundamental limits to single pair emission rates. The design integrates with commercial and already deployed frequency multiplexed hardware. Narrowband photons can also be used in ways that differ from those photons generated with the established broadband sources. The pulse shape created by the cavity ringdown is more compatible with several platforms of quantum memories, which mostly require narrowband photons with a Lorentzian spectrum.

However, as AI and machine learning rapidly grow, the associated energy costs and greenhouse emissions are exploding. This massively unsustainable trend threatens to prevent society from achieving a net-zero future. Hence, a paradigm shift for low-power computing and AI processing is urgently needed. This project contributes to tackling this historic challenge by delivering foundational knowledge and technology concerning the fundamental excitations in magnetic nanostructures to create a transformative computing scheme taking inspiration from the brain. Current computing architectures rely on a constant shuttling of data between separate memory and processor, which is highly inefficient. Furthermore, current computing platforms are based on the flow of electronic charges, leading to dissipation in the form of Joule heating. To circumvent these problems, the research team aims to harness the dynamics in networks of interacting nanomagnets for bio-inspired processing by A) alleviating the processor-memory information transfer bottleneck and B) enabling the transport and processing of data based on waves rather than moving charges. The educational outreach component of this project fosters increased public participation in scientific research. The educational goals are designed to engage multiple levels of learning in wave physics: 1) a new course is developed for lifelong learners and 2) training programs are developed for schoolteachers working with a diverse student population by creating an accessible wave demonstration. Technical description: Spin waves, and their quanta - magnons - are the fundamental collective excitations of a magnetic system. Magnons can transport and process information without moving charges, and hence, magnonic devices can be less dissipative than their electronic counterparts. Nanomagnetic arrays are similar to neural networks, providing memory and computing abilities in the same unit: they can retain information stored in their magnetization orientation and process that information by magnonic excitations. This project explores several paths in nanomagnonics by determining the magnon properties in lithographically defined arrays of interacting nanomagnets, where information is passed between nanomagnetic ‘neurons’ via magnon-magnon coupling acting as ‘synapses’. Therefore, advances are needed to understand dynamic mode coupling in networks of nanomagnets. This project addresses critical knowledge gaps in the fundamental understanding of strongly interacting magnetic networks. The four specific aims are 1) controlling magnons in two-dimensional arrays of nanomagnets, 2) manipulating magnon-magnon interactions, and 3) understand nonlinear dynamics in magnetic nanostructures to 4) experimentally realize the next-generation of neuromorphic magnonic computing concepts. The nanomagnetic networks are fabricated by electron-beam lithography, electron-beam evaporation, and lift-off and studied by optical, electrical, and microwave methods. The experimental investigations are supported by micromagnetic modeling.

"ExpandQISE: Track 1: Bright, Highly Polarization-Squeezed Light Beam for Quantum Metrology","Non-technical Abstract: Squeezed light refers to quantum states of light in which the noise fluctuations in certain quadrature components of the electric field amplitude, or the polarization, are squeezed below the shot-noise limit. This enables better signal-to-noise in optical measurements than possible with perfectly coherent light emanating from the quietest lasers. Currently, there is great interest in exploiting this quantum advantage for precision measurement. Optical magnetometers are paradigmatic examples of high-performance magnetic field sensors that rely on the quantum advantage afforded by polarization-squeezed light. In this project, a new device, essentially a modified magnetometer, is built to generate a polarization-squeezed light beam with an unprecedentedly high degree of squeezing. The emerging beam is especially suited for transformatively advancing the field of quantum-enhanced optical magnetometry. The polarization-squeezed beam may also enable significant advancement in many other diverse fields, ranging from gravitational-wave detection to quantum-limited control of mechanical motion, where squeezed light affords quantum advantage. A close collaboration between Miami University, Ohio and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, leverages existing expertise in optical magnetometry at Wisconsin to synergistically engage Masters’ (MS) students and undergraduates at Miami and also students at high schools near Miami in intensive research and education at the forefront of quantum metrology. Concurrently, the project diversifies and expands student and faculty engagement at Miami in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) by a) developing two new QISE-centered physics courses, one at the freshman level, the other at the senior / first-year MS level, and b) incorporating key QISE concepts into multiple existing physics courses at all levels that impact several hundred science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors per year. Technical Abstract: The goal of this project is to create a robust and efficient source of polarization-squeezed light to significantly enhance the performance of two widely-used state-of-the-art optical magnetometers, namely, spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers, which are currently the most sensitive magnetic sensors at extremely low magnetic fields (below one picoTesla), and Bell-Bloom magnetometers, which operate at earth-scale magnetic fields. The Miami-Wisconsin team’s method to create highly polarization-squeezed light relies on exploiting the physics of off-resonant Faraday rotation in dense atomic vapor. The key to this method is that the quantum polarization fluctuations in the light are mapped into effective magnetic field fluctuations via the AC Stark effect, which causes the atomic spins to alter the spin-dependent index of refraction in such a way as to cancel the original quantum polarization fluctuations. This yields highly polarization-squeezed light in a narrow frequency band from near-dc to about a kHz, where SERF magnetometers operate. Next, the Larmor frequency response of the atoms is engineered to produce squeezing centered at a desired radio frequency, which has vital import for Bell-Bloom magnetometers. The polarization squeezing process is modeled, and new theoretical approaches to squeezing in optical magnetometry are developed.

EMERGENT SPIN TEXTURES AND DYNAMICS OF 2D MATERIALS,"Nontechnical abstract The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets opens the door to the exploration of magnetic behavior in these ultra-thin materials. However, it is a challenge to study these thin materials with tools designed for macroscopically large samples, making it hard to create accurate models of their magnetic properties. To tackle this challenge, the research team uses special X-ray and optical techniques that are sensitive to very thin samples, along with theoretical models to understand the properties of 2D magnets. The PI and team aim to focus on two main areas: (1) studying the nanoscale magnetic patterns in 2D magnets; and (2) exploring the low-energy dynamics of 2D magnets. The research work aims to develop electronic and magnetic devices for applications in low-power storage and computing, which are important for creating energy-efficient big data platforms in the age of artificial intelligence. The project includes a program to give research opportunities to college students from schools with fewer science resources, helping to reduce academic inequality and bring more diversity to STEM graduate programs. Technical abstract The study and characterization of the microscopic spin physics in two-dimensional (2D) magnets is a timely topic at the frontier of materials research. The discovery of atomically thin magnets adds a new building block and creates opportunities to realize novel spin phenomena in 2D quantum nanomaterials. However, the microscopic spin physics of this new class of materials in the ultrathin limit is inaccessible to several probes of bulk materials, hindering the development of quantitative models of emergent 2D magnetism. The research team approaches this important challenge using advanced X-ray and optical spectroscopy and scattering probes together with theoretical modeling of the microscopic interactions and magnetic phase diagram using ab initio (DFT) and Monte Carlo methods. The PI and team seek to pursue two main research directions: (1) the study of ground state magnetic textures in 2D magnets and heterostructures; and (2) the study of low-energy spin dynamics in 2D magnets. These activities are poised to significantly advance our understanding of spin phenomena in low-dimensional systems and serve to guide new applications in nanoengineered systems and devices. Additionally, the project includes a pilot program offering longitudinal research experiences to undergraduates from institutions with limited STEM opportunities, aiming to reduce academic inequality and diversify graduate applicant pools, alongside outreach activities for middle school students focused on materials research.

MRI: Track 1 Development and implementation of a fast cooling pulsed magnet design for repetitive operation,"This project will develop special research magnets that will create some of the highest magnetic fields on earth. These high magnetic fields will help scientists understand how magnetism and superconductivity work at the atomic level, and how to make new functional materials that rely on these properties. The development work will include training at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc level. These students will be exposed to complex instrumentation in their home laboratory and at national laboratories where they will be exposed to high level science. New superconducting systems seem to be discovered every few years, and advances in magnetism show no signs of stopping. Developing these proposed research magnets will accelerate discoveries in new materials with magnetic and superconducting properties. Fundamental physics discoveries involving magnetism have led to the rapid miniaturization of everything from earbuds to hard drives. Advances in superconducting materials and magnets have transformed medical imaging, and are at the heart of most successful quantum computers. The use of magnetic and superconducting materials to improve our electric grid, electric motors, and appliances is widely anticipated, but depends on the continued advancement of our understanding of materials with both magnetic and superconducting properties. High magnetic fields and low temperatures are essential to understanding quantum states of matter, the states of matter that give us technologies such as superconductivity, magnetism, and quantum computers. This development proposal will create pulsed magnets in the range of 30 - 50 tesla that will greatly increase the throughput of high magnetic field research laboratories and create magnets that can be used at light sources such as X-ray laboratories. Low temperatures are essential to lower the energy of a system so that the interactions between electrons dominate the physics of materials. Electrons are intrinsically magnetic, so magnetic fields are a natural probe of electron behavior. Given the energy scales of temperature and how an electron interacts with a magnetic field, 10 kelvin is about equal to 15 tesla. Therefore, to study materials, many quantum phenomena require magnetic fields on the order of tens of tesla. The goal of this project is to create a magnet that can be pulsed to 40 tesla once a minute, or 50 tesla every five minutes thus increasing the repetition rate of magnet pulses by a factor of four, greatly increasing the number of experiments that can be done at the university based laboratory. These designs will be applicable to many other pulsed field laboratories, and in particular for the Argonne National laboratory X-ray beam line. The researchers will design a magnet that could be used in the beam line at Advanced Photon Source. Additionally, this research will train scientists at the level of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. These students and postdocs will be directly involved in experiments at our university and national laboratories, preparing them to be the next generation of senior research scientists at leading US research institutions.

ExpandQISE: Track 1: Demonstration of distributed quantum sensing with Heisenberg scaling by creating multipartite entanglement among eight nodes on a commercial quantum network,"Non-technical Abstract: The project aims to establish a comprehensive Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) program at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC). Focusing on research, education, workforce development, and community participation in quantum technologies, the project partners with Texas A&M University (TAMU) to investigate a novel theoretical and experimental scheme for demonstrating distributed quantum sensing on a metropolitan-scale fiber-optic quantum network in downtown Chattanooga. The research focuses on creating and distributing multi-photon entangled states across multiple distant nodes on the quantum network and demonstrating distributed quantum sensing with Heisenberg scaling with the number of involved nodes on the network. In collaboration with several industry partners, UTC has established a Quantum Node Lab connected to the world’s first software-reconfigurable commercial quantum network, powered by Qubitekk, Inc., and deployed by the Electric Power Board (EPB) of Chattanooga. This lab serves as the testbed for the project on the deployed fiber network infrastructure. This cross-sector interdisciplinary collaboration among UTC, TAMU, Qubitekk, and EPB significantly expands UTC’s QISE research capacity and broadens surrounding communities’ participation in QISE. The research findings and results are in turn used to enhance experiential learning experience for students enrolled in the newly launched QISE certificate program at UTC, developed for upskilling technology professionals in surrounding communities. Additionally, PI Li is part of an ongoing NSF ExLENT project to establish an inter-institutional QISE curriculum in the Southeastern US. This ExpandQISE project naturally feeds into the ExLENT effort by offering experiential training to the next generation of QISE professionals to meet the increasing regional demand for quantum talents. Technical Abstract: Most current experimental quantum sensing demonstrations are limited to measuring physical quantities at a single location or distributed sensing of multiple physical quantities within a controlled lab environment. There is no concrete manifestation of distributed quantum sensing on a deployed commercial network infrastructure thus far. The objective of this project is thus to bridge the gap between proof-of-concept in-lab demonstration and practical real-world implementation. Specifically, the project aims to experimentally demonstrate distributed quantum sensing with Heisenberg-scaling among 8 distant nodes on a deployed metropolitan-scale fiber-optic commercial network infrastructure. Theoretically, the project utilizes both Fisher information matrix (FIM) and quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) to provide feasible measurement procedure for attaining Heisenberg scaling with coincidence photon counting. Experimentally, the project creates, characterizes, and distributes a 4-photon entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state across 8 distant nodes on the deployed commercial quantum network, and demonstrates distributed quantum sensing with Heisenberg scaling via measurements of 8 unknown local phases in the 8 nodes. This project serves as an excellent example of advancing quantum information science and engineering (QISE) across both academia and the private sector.

WoU-MMA: Generation of Ultrastrong Magnetic Fields in Nascent Neutron Stars,"Neutron stars (NS), one end product of massive star evolution, are among the densest objects in the universe. Many NS show evidence of extremely strong magnetic fields that can be generated during their birth or in mergers of NS binaries. A theoretical investigation at Columbia University aims to understand the origin of ultrastrong magnetic fields and the diffusive processes that regulate the onset of turbulence and magnetic field generation. Numerical experiments will be carried out in the relevant physical regime. The proposed systematic revision of dynamo mechanisms can have a significant impact on the field and pave the way for realistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars and mergers. In addition, public outreach efforts will be undertaken to present the research in a more accessible form to larger audiences, including high-school students at two existing educational programs. The project will involve training of university students and postdoctoral researchers. The research team will investigate mechanisms generating ultra-strong large-scale magnetic fields in magnetars and NS mergers. A turbulent dynamo inside a nascent rotating NS requires an instability to create turbulence, and the canonical candidates include the Tayler instability and convection. The proposed research has two parts: (1) A crucial revision of the linear stability analysis to correctly capture the interplay of rotation and microscopic diffusive processes (in particular, viscosity and thermal conductivity due to neutrino diffusion). Preliminary results suggest a new picture of marginally stable proto-neutron stars, potentially explaining two classes: ordinary pulsars and magnetars. A similar analysis of mergers will give necessary conditions for a successful dynamo in the merger remnants. (2) State-of-the-art simulations of nonlinear turbulence triggered in nascent remnants. The simulations will model a rotating, stratified, magnetized fluid sphere using a pseudo-spectral code. They will allow direct control of diffusivities and implementation of the correct physical regime of turbulence development. The numerical tools will also be used to investigate a very different origin of magnetic fields: the chiral magnetic effect.

The Origin of Planckian Scattering in Strange Metals,"Non-technical abstract “Limits” play an important role in physics, just like speed limits play an important role on our roads. For example, nothing can move faster than the speed of light. This limit was the basis of Einstein’s theory of relatively, and it governs everything from how we do astronomy to how we build nuclear reactors. Recently, a new type of limit has emerged called the “Planckian limit”. This proposed limit states that electrons can “run into” each other in a metal no faster than an amount set by the temperature of the metal and fundamental constants of nature – Planck and Boltzmann’s constants. This limit, if it holds true, has implications for physics problems as broad as finding room-temperature superconductors to how quickly quantum information can be transported. This project uses the world’s strongest magnetic fields and ultrasound to test whether the Planckian limit really is a limit and, if so, what underlying physical laws give rise to such a limit. This research will train the next generation of physicists in high-frequency electronics and quantum materials and will develop outreach activities for high school-student workshops held at Cornell. Technical abstract Strange metals have electrical resistivity that is linear in temperature (T-linear) all the way down to zero temperature. This distinctive behavior often appears in conjunction with unconventional superconductivity: high-temperature superconducting cuprates, iron pnictides, organics, heavy fermions, and magic angle twisted bilayer graphene all have T-linear resistivity in their phase diagrams near where the transition temperature is maximized. One captivating idea is that of a “Planckian bound” – a universal upper limit on electron scattering in metals. Such a bound, if it exists, could explain why such disparate systems all show universal T-linear resistivity. This proposal combines high magnetic field electrical transport experiments with state-of-the-art, high-frequency ultrasound to uncover what causes T-linear resistivity, why it appears to follow a fundamental “Planckian bound”, and how strange metals evolve into conventional metals as their carrier density is tuned. These experiments will broaden our understanding of how strange metals arise and whether they obey a new fundamental bound.

Cosmology in the Local Volume with Hawai'i Supernova Flows,"The origin and evolution of the Universe on the largest scales is one of the most profound questions in astrophysics today. A team of scientists at the University of Hawai'i will continue and substantially expand the Hawai‘i Supernova Flows survey. They will use than 3,000 new Type Ia supernovae to map the largest structures in the Universe to 300 Mpc, tripling the volume currently surveyed. The survey will enable them to put strong constrains on the expansion of the universe (H0) and the growth of large-scale structure over time. The results of this work will be made accessible to the public through videos, interactive models, and virtual reality. In addition, the team is committed to increasing education and engagement opportunities in Hawai’i by 1) enabling stronger connections to high school students via HI STAR, 2) connecting Maunakea telescopes to undergraduate courses at UH Hilo on Hawai i island, and 3) providing impactful internship opportunities for talented Hawai‘i undergraduates. The Hawai‘i Supernova Flows survey currently combines high-cadence optical light curves from ATLAS with near-infrared (NIR) light curves from UKIRT in the North. The proposed work will add ATLAS and LSST in the South for full-sky coverage. The primary goal of this proposal is to map the largest structures in the Universe to 300 Mpc, tripling the volume currently surveyed.

New Physics in Artificial Spin Ice via Materials Innovation,"Non-Technical Abstract Magnetic materials are extremely important technologically, and magnets that have size scale in the range of nanometers are especially important in a range of applications, such as hard disk drives. The fundamental physics of such tiny “nanomagnets” is also exciting, because collections of them show behavior that cannot be observed in any other physical system and can be controlled very precisely. Collections of these nanomagnets in certain carefully designed arrays are called “artificial spin ice” because they share some underlying physics with water molecules in ice. This research program studies such artificial spin ice composed of carefully chosen materials that result in a wide range of unusual behavior that would otherwise be inaccessible and could have significant technological implications once explored and understood. While the vast majority of prior research in this area uses only simple magnetic materials, this work will introduce more exotic materials to access specific, unusual, and potentially useful physics. Aside from connections to possible technologies, the research will also contribute substantially to the education of both undergraduate and graduate students, and the research efforts will inform the investigators’ work on behalf of the larger research ecosystem in the nation. Technical Abstract The research program will significantly expand the physics that can be probed in artificial spin ice by fabricating arrays from strategically chosen, innovative ferromagnetic materials through a collaboration between two investigators with highly complementary expertise, in materials fabrication and characterization, and magnetic measurements. The research will focus on three thrusts: 1. New artificial spin ice physics enabled by magnetic moments that point out of the plane of the structures, exploring cooperative phenomena that are inaccessible with in-plane moments. 2. Artificial spin ice behavior and superparamagnetism in the regime of strongly-temperature-dependent magnetization. 3. Emergent materials-induced electronic transport phenomena through networks of connected artificial spin ice. The research findings may have technological relevance in new computing paradigms and in magnonics. Undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be deeply involved in the research efforts and will gain a range of skills to advance their professional development. Both investigators will also leverage their involvement in various activities to further support the national research community.

CAREER: Epitaxial stabilization of non-perovskite oxide quantum materials,"Non-Technical abstract: Quantum mechanics determines the properties of all materials at the finest length scales. There exist some materials, however, where the quantum nature transcends from the microscopic to the macroscopic and in doing so produces incredible phenomena. These so-called quantum materials have the potential to revolutionize a number of fields, in applications ranging from low-energy computing to dissipationless current flow. Further advances in this field require the design and discovery of novel quantum materials with enhanced functionality. The research team will synthesize a new family of quantum materials that have not been made previously and probe the atomic structure of these compounds. The team will also develop an elementary science curriculum for a dual language program and support first-generation and low-income undergraduate researchers. Technical Abstract: Complex oxides display some of the most exotic physical states known, with phenomena as diverse as high-temperature superconductivity and ferromagnetism. To date, however, much of the work on complex oxides thin films and heterostructures has focused on the perovskite oxides. Here the research team seeks to develop the synthesis and characterization of a distinct set of oxide materials which could display additional emergent phenomena not present in the perovskite oxides. The materials will be synthesized with reactive oxide molecular-beam epitaxy, allowing exquisite control over the deposited structures. The project will study emergent superconductivity in LiTi2O4 as well as heavy fermion, spin-polarized and possible topological compounds.

A Deep Search for Planets with the Keck Planet Finder,"Starting with the Nobel-Prize winning detection of a “hot Jupiter” in 1995, the Doppler technique based on stellar spectra has been a ground-breaking method for finding planets around stars other than the Sun. This and other techniques have indicated that most stars have planets with masses of just a few Earth masses – small enough to have rocky surfaces – with orbital periods of ~1-300 days. Direct imaging space missions may one day record the light of these planets, but techniques to measure such small masses still need maturation. In this project, researchers in the California Planet Search collaboration will survey nearby stars for these low-mass planets, with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrometer at Keck Observatory. These data will almost surely detect new planets, and they will also allow researchers to learn how to reach Doppler precisions of 10 centimeters-per-second using the spectral features, which is necessary to detect Earth analogues. The project will support student researchers, as well as run an Introduction to Astronomy Research program for less privileged students, allowing greater access to the research skills students need for astronomy or other STEM fields. KPF is a high-resolution, fiber-fed spectrometer on the Keck I telescope, with high thermomechanical and optical stability for precise radial velocity measurements. Its advanced technology includes a laser frequency comb for calibration, exotic materials to reduce thermal sensitivity, and a separate UV spectrometer for stellar activity tracking. Early results demonstrate KPF's high throughput, efficient operation, and impressive Doppler stability, achieving the precision needed for this survey of ten nearby G and K-type stars. Each star will be observed approximately 100 times over three years with KPF, with an expected limiting detection amplitude on month-timescale orbital periods of 50 centimeters per second. To achieve this goal, the team will develop new algorithms to analyze the stellar spectra in a line-by-line approach. Discoveries of new systems of small planets will teach us about the formation and evolution of planets like our own and will be the best targets nearly all future studies of nearby stars. The survey spectra will have SNR = 600-1600 per reduced pixel, a new regime of precision.

Spin lattice and electron lattice interactions in correlated quantum materials,"Spin-lattice and electron-lattice interactions are fundamental interactions in solids. These interactions determine many of the basic macroscopic properties of materials such as superconductivity or the magnetoelectric effect. In this proposal we would like to address these fundamental interactions by a combined approach of experimental x-ray techniques. We propose to use our expertise on resonant x-ray scattering to directly determine the corresponding order parameters of spins and electrons and address its coupling to the lattice. We will combine it with the gained knowhow from studies of ultrafast phenomena at X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL)s, where we can decouple the interaction on ultrafast time scales. The goals are fourfold: (i) Apply these techniques to newly available free standing (FS) ultrathin perovskites, starting with SrTiO3 (STO) and LaCoO3 (LCO) and their trilayers, which can be manipulated easily by strain and other tuning parameters, (ii) quantifying the spin-lattice interaction for an individual mode, e.g. an electromagnon, by exciting it and quantifying the deflection of the atoms and the spins on ultrafast timescales (iii) to manipulate the magnetic exchange interaction through lattice changes and to use it to drive a frustrated material through a quantum critical point. (iv) to study the fundamental characteristics of chiral excitations [1] and to use novel schemes to excite them to change crystal chirality and magnetic properties on ultrafast times scales.  These projects do not only use the whole expertise of the proposer, but is also optimal placed in the collaborative environment of the groups within PSI, connecting SwissFEL, the SLS with expertise in sample growth and characterization. It uses both static soft and hard (resonant) x-ray techniques and the relevant endstations of SwissFEL: BERNINA & FURKA (just came online), the full strength of PSI’s newest large-scale research facilities.

Search for Dark Matter with the LUX-Zeplin Experiment,"This proposal is to request support to carry out a research program in experimental high energy physics as part of the LUX-Zeplin (LZ) direct dark matter search experiment at the University of Zürich (UZH) headed by PI Björn Penning. LZ aims to detect and study dark matter particles, which are believed to compose about 80/% of the mass of the universe. Penning is strongly established in the LZ experiment, the present world's leading dark matter search experiment.

ExpandQISE: Track 1: Topological phonon dynamics and control in quantum materials,"Nontechnical Abstract: This ExpandQISE project at The College of Charleston and The University of South Carolina aims to advance the fundamental understanding of topological phonons in engineered quantum materials by controlling the light - matter interaction in these materials. The research advances the field of integrated quantum phononics by systematically exploring quantum materials that possess the functionalities to develop novel quantum phonoic devices. To maximize the effectiveness of the discovery process, this project combines ultrafast optical spectroscopy and microscopy, materials synthesis and characterization, and computation and modeling to explore the generation, dynamics, and control of topological phonons in quantum materials. The collaborative research will provide necessary education for preparing CofC undergraduate students for the next quantum technology revolution and the needed workforce for economic growth in South Carolina. Special efforts are made to increase the participation of underrepresented minority and female groups in this research through the CofC admissions and institutional diversity offices. Technical Abstract: Topological phonons are lattice vibrations in crystalline solids and a type of quantum information carrier. They advance traditional information processing systems with high frequencies (terahertz), low energy consumption, and the ability to exploit surface or boundary modes that are stable against perturbation. However, their generation and manipulation remain challenging. This project leverages the complementary expertise of two scientists to identify and characterize potential new quantum information carriers in topological materials. Through ultrafast optical spectroscopy and microscopy (Gong group, CofC), materials synthesis and characterization (Jin group, USC), and computation and modeling (collaborators), the research team aims to explore the generation, dynamics, and control of topological phonons in quantum materials. Understanding the relationship between material composition, structure, and properties is essential for controlling material properties. This collaborative effort provides strategies to control topological phonon dynamics, including frequency, amplitude, and damping.

"Collaborative Research: Geometry, Entanglement and the Dynamics of Fields, Strings and Gravity","This Collaborative Grant supports the research of Professors Sebastian Franco, Parameswaran Nair and Alexios Polychronakos at the City College of the City University of New York and Professors Daniel Kabat and Dimitra Karabali at Lehman College of the City University of New York. As part of this research project, the PIs will advance our understanding of the physical world at its most fundamental level by bringing new mathematical tools to bear on some of nature's most puzzling properties. One property, arising from the quantum world, is known as ""quantum entanglement"". Quantum entanglement means that two well-separated systems need not have independent properties of their own. This surprising aspect of nature --- at least in principle --- enables quantum computers to outrace any ordinary computer. Another property crucial to modern astronomy and cosmology is Einstein's insight that gravity is related to the curvature of space and time. This research relates and unifies these concepts by establishing connections between them and by developing new mathematical tools through which to study their properties. This exploration will take place within quantum field theory, the fundamental framework for describing all known particle interactions, and within string theory, the most promising direction for a full unification of the quantum world with gravity. This research will advance the national interest by maintaining US preeminence in the exploration and understanding of physical laws. This project will also involve graduate students, thereby providing crucial research training for young scientists. Undergraduate and high school students --- especially from underrepresented groups --- will also be integrated into the research, further broadening the societal impact of this project. More technically, this project draws on mathematical concepts from geometry, abstract algebra, and quantum information theory to build new understandings of field theory, string theory, and gravity. Specific areas of research include: I) strongly interacting gauge fields, which form the paradigm for nuclear forces; II) the role of boundary effects on quantum entanglement; III) geometric approaches to the quantum Hall effect, a phenomenon of central importance in low temperature condensed matter systems; IV) braneworld dynamics, focusing on phenomenology and cosmology with broken Lorentz invariance; V) chaos and thermalization in multi-matrix models and on non-commutative spaces; VI) brane constructions of supersymmetric field theories, emphasizing models with (0,2) supersymmetry and counts of BPS states; VII) stringy realizations of superconformal field theories in 5D; VIII) statistical mechanics of random walk processes; and IX) statistical mechanics of magnetic systems with higher unitary symmetry.

BSM-PM: A Highly Charged Ion-Based Quantum-Logic Clock for Precision Tests of Fundamental Physics,"For this project, the PI and collaborators will perform high-precision, quantum-enabled laser spectroscopy experiments on trapped, highly charged ions for the purpose of testing fundamental physics at low energy. Highly charged ions (atoms in which several electrons have been removed) are among the most sensitive systems to a possible time-variation of the fundamental physical constants. This high sensitivity, combined with laser-accessible transitions, makes them a unique platform for investigating predicted extensions to the standard model of particle physics. This project will focus on the development of an optical atomic clock based on trapped highly charged metal ions. The experiment will combine techniques that have been developed for ion trap-based quantum computing and optical frequency standards with a compact source of highly charged ions. This project will also provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of experimental atomic, molecular and optical physics, optical frequency metrology, and precision measurements. Several optical transitions in highly charged ions provide both an enhanced sensitivity to possible time-variation of the fine-structure constant (alpha) and favorable systematics as optical clocks when compared to singly charged ions and neutral atoms. In particular, these systems are immune to frequency shifts due to the presence of blackbody radiation (BBR). Using quantum-enabled spectroscopy techniques, the research team aims to develop an optical atomic clock based on narrow linewidth transitions in highly charged praseodymium ions (PrXI). A highly charged ion optical clock with a fractional systematic uncertainty at the level of one part in ten to the eighteen, when compared to an optical clock based on singly ionized ytterbium (YbII), could lead to a factor of one hundred improvement in the current laboratory limit on time-variation of alpha. Either an improved limit on the constancy of alpha, or a non-zero signal of the time-variation of alpha could be used to constrain physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. Results from this experimental work will be analyzed in the context of theoretical extensions to the standard model that propose new dark matter candidates and couplings that would lead to the observation of a non-zero value of the time-variation of alpha.

Cosmic ray electron and gamma-ray telescope in a lake,"The idea of the project is to re-use optical modules of ANTARES neutrino telescope, which has recently finished data taking, in a novel type Water-Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) for detection of cosmic ray electrons and gamma-rays. The spectrum of cosmic ray electrons has been previously measured up to 10 TeV energy by space-based detectors and by HESS Cherenkov telescope. At higher energies, measurements were hampered by the challenge of suppression of proton and nuclei cosmic ray background. WCDAs use the Earth's atmosphere and an array of light sensors immersed in water (tanks, ponds, lakes) to detect high-energy particle Extensive Air Showers (EAS) produced by protons, atomic nuclei, electrons/positrons and gamma-rays with multi-TeV energies. Existing WCDAs have never measured the electron spectrum, because of the same problem as HESS: the presence of background of proton and nuclei induced EAS background. It is possible to suppress this background by adding a second photosensor layer at several meters of depth. Such a layer, optically isolated from the top layer, will be able to detect muons inevitably present in the proton and nuclei EAS, but rarely found in the electron and gamma-ray induced EAS. This “muon tagging” background rejection technique can be efficient already at 10 TeV energy if the muon detection layer is continuous and large (>100m scale). Such a large detector needs to be assembled from smaller optically isolated Elementary Cells (ECs). We plan to design, build and test the EC building blocks of the large two-layer WCDA. Each EC will have two tarpaulins one on top of the other, enclosing ANTARES optical modules. The ECs will be operating autonomously, powered by solar panels. We plan to deploy and test a small WCDA (30-60 m scale) assembled of such ECs in Geneva Lake, to validate our design choices in realistic environmental conditions, to characterize the performance of the WCDA made of such ECs, and to prepare larger WCDA deployment in a higher altitude lake.",759309,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Renewal: Fundamental Physics of Polariton Condensates,"Nontechnical decription: This project, funded jointly by the Condensed Matter Physics and Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics - Experiment programs, supports fundamental physics studies in a new class of superfluids. Superfluidity is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon in which below a certain temperature, many particles spontaneously join together to act as a wave. There are just a few physical systems that are known to act this way. The oldest is superfluid liquid helium, which flows with zero viscosity. Superconducting metals are another example, in which electrons act as a wave, and flow with zero resistance, and ultracold atoms in ultrahigh vacuum, stabilized by laser beams and magnetic field are another. In the past decade, another class of superfluid has received widespread attention, namely “heavy photons” known as “polaritons,” in which photons can flow like a liquid. This project supports basic research studies of these polariton superfluids, made possible by using semiconductor structures, fabricated as part of this project, that are the best in the world in terms of smoothness and lack of impurities. This project can have broad impact in increasing our understanding of universal properties of superfluids, and in making possible new types of optical communications devices. The PI of the project will also continue to collaborate with the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh to educate the public on general quantum mechanics and optics topics. Technical description: This project supports the continuing work of PI Snoke on fundamental properties of exciton-polaritons in GaAs-AlGaAs microcavities. The structures are designed by the Snoke group and then fabricated using molecular-beam epitaxy by two labs, the group of Loren Pfeiffer at Princeton and the group of Zbig Wasilewski at the University of Waterloo. One goal of the project is to advance the quality of these microcavity structures, in particular to make large area structures with a high degree of flatness and very little leakage of light out of the structures, which will allow the possibility of optical circuits on a chip with propagation lengths of hundreds of microns. The Snoke group will use advanced optical methods including picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy, imaging, and interferometry to study polariton superfluids in these structures. In the past year, two breakthrough results have been obtained, and an immediate goal will be to perform followup experiments to fully understand these effects. One of these is the demonstration of a true persistent current of a polariton superfluid in a ring. While indirect evidence for persistent current has been seen in other systems, the microcavity polariton system allows direct, in situ measurement of the phase of the superfluid while it is circulating. The other new result is a highly accurate measurement of the superfluid fraction while the system is in thermal equilibrium. A universal power law has been observed which was not theoretically predicted nor observed in other experimental systems. Ongoing collaboration with many-body theorists will seek to create an analytical model for this power law. In the longer term, this project will seek to make networks of coupled polariton superfluids, which can be used both for ultrafast (~10 ps) optical switching methods as well as novel methods of analog optical computing to solve mathematical problems that are hard for traditional computers.

New vertex reconstruction to search for rare Higgs bosondecays at the CMS experiment,"In particle physics, we study nature at its most fundamental level by observing particle collisions. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN offers the unique opportunity to study particle collisions at highest energies and challenge our current understanding of fundamental particles and forces. The Higgs boson is a central part of the Standard Model of particle physics as it provides the mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking. It is the only fundamental scalar that has been observed so far and might well be the portal toward a wider sector of new particles and fields. Characterizing the properties of the Higgs boson by measuring its couplings to other Standard Model particles is one of the main goals of the physics program at the LHC to explore the possibility of physics beyond the Standard Model. I propose a research program to search for new physics effects in rare decays of the Higgs boson. Specifically I am interested in the decays of the Higgs boson to gauge bosons and pseudoscalar or vector mesons. These decays are much suppressed in the Standard Model such that a potential observation would hint to new physics phenomena. To date the branching ratios of these decays are only weakly constrained experimentally or completely unexplored.  The research program will be carried out with the CMS experiment at the LHC and use the data that has been or will be collected during the LHC Run 2 (2015-2018) and Run 3 (2022-2025). The proposed search channels have complex signatures in the detector and are challenging to reconstruct experimentally. In particular, the measurements rely on an excellent performance of the tracking detectors to precisely reconstruct displaced vertices from the decay of long-lived particles. An integral part of this project is the development of new methods for vertex reconstruction based on state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques. This development will be crucial to exploit the full physics potential of the LHC, especially in view of the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade, where particles from an average of 200 simultaneous collisions will need to be reconstructed.",756781,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
CAREER: Towards room-temperature quantum simulators enabled by halide perovskites,"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Non-Technical Description Quantum effects are any phenomena that typically happen at small scales and cannot be explained by classical mechanics. There are many important research problems involving quantum effects that classical computers cannot fully solve. For example, the rational design of complex materials can require understanding the collective behavior of many atomic components and their quantum interactions. A quantum simulator is a device that can actively consider the complex interactions (quantum effects) to model these real-world complex systems in a programmable fashion. However, traditionally, these quantum simulators have to work at ultralow temperatures, making them expensive to prepare and operate. This CAREER project aims to transform the field of quantum simulators through a combined research and education program focused on novel optical materials and their integration approaches for realizing quantum simulators at room temperature. Specifically, the PI will synthesize novel new optical materials, integrate them with photonic structures, demonstrate functional room-temperature quantum simulators, and use them to study the rich exotic materials properties that are previously challenging to fully understand. An integrated education program will also expand quantum science and technology accessibility in Nebraska by working with teachers via workshops and labs to provide them with a scientific frontier perspective. Additionally, this program will engage undergraduate and high school students in workshops and internships, with a particular focus on first-generation college students and students from traditionally underrepresented groups. These efforts aim to increasing the diversity and competitiveness of the future scientific workforce. Technical description: The goals of this project are to reveal quantum phenomena previously observed only at low-temperature at room temperature (RT) with excitonic halide perovskites materials in the optical cavities and build a competitive quantum optics education program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Strong coupling between excitons and photons in high-quality optical cavities produces a new hybrid half-matter, half-light quasiparticle called exciton-polariton that exhibits ultrasmall effective mass inherited from the photon and significant nonlinearity inherited from the exciton. These qualities allow exciton-polaritons to undergo a transition to Bose-Einstein condensation at RT, potentially enabling a broad range of applications, such as optical analog quantum simulators and low threshold polariton lasers. The project will significantly expand our understanding of how excitons interact at RT and form stable polariton quantum liquid in these new perovskite material systems. It also provides a fantastic photonic platform for exploring the macroscopic quantum phenomenon at RT without requiring complicated and expensive ultracold atoms, cryostats, or molecular beam epitaxy growth vacuum chambers. Lastly, the tunable mode splitting in perovskite microcavities behaves as an effective magnetic field on photon spin, enabling studies on synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields and topological physics at RT. This research, which will utilize nanofabrication, materials synthesis, and optical spectroscopy methods to study halide perovskite materials, promises to transform the field of RT polaritonics and quantum simulators. It will also undergird an integrated education program focusing on quantum photonics. A graduate course, various outreach pathways, and a K-12 teacher workshop, all featuring research frontiers in quantum photonics, will be developed with the ultimate goal of building a diverse, globally competitive workforce pipeline on quantum science, a critical knowledge frontier for the nation.

"Open Mirror Geometry for Landau-Ginzburg Models, Renewal","Mirror symmetry is a modern research discipline that aims to mathematically prove a duality from string theory establishes new theorems in geometry. In particular, mirror symmetry links two areas of geometry by predicting that the symplectic geometry of a given space M is encoded in the algebraic geometry of a so-called mirror space M*. It has inspired deep theorems in mathematics and solved centuries-old problems in enumerative geometry. Moreover, it provided a pathway towards establishing new foundations which encode the study of geometric disciplines like symplectic topology and algebraic geometry using the language of homological algebra, following the ideas of Fields Medallist Kontsevich. Mirror symmetry transcends mathematical disciplines, having used techniques from geometry, algebra, combinatorics, integrable systems, number theory and mathematical physics.

Given a symplectic space M, the first question we have to answer is how to construct a conjectural mirror space M*. Afterwards, one aims to prove that the mirror phenomenon occurs, i.e., the study of symplectic geometry of M are encoded by the algebro-geometric study of M*. Historically these two questions are handled separately, but the modern approach to constructing mirrors aims to build the mirror directly from geometric data of M, handling both steps in realising mirror symmetry simultaneously. 

Broadly speaking, this fellowship develops foundations towards building the mirror intrinsically in the case where M is a Landau-Ginzburg model. Roughly, a Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model is a function encapsulating geometry in its singularity theory. In the last decade, they have become crucial to the understanding of mirror symmetry as they can be found naturally by deforming certain spaces in symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry. However, they are interesting in their own right in the field of non-commutative algebraic geometry. 

In the first part of the fellowship, the open (and closed) enumerative geometry of Landau-Ginzburg models have been explored. Jointly with Ran Tessler and Mark Gross, we established a new approach to construct mirrors for (certain) Landau-Ginzburg models. This is done by building / generalising an open enumerative theory for Landau-Ginzburg models and writing a mirror LG model using the open enumerative invariants computed. 

The primary outputs of the first part of the fellowship included: developing an open enumerative theory in dimension two for Fermat polynomials, proving the first open mirror symmetry theorem for LG models, establishing the first wall-crossing structures for enumerative geometries for LG models, proving a new type of open topological recursion relation, and establishing a formula for primary genus-zero r-spin invariants.

This renewal continues this investigation, breaking past dimension two. This involves new rich mathematical structures and develops closer tether to the approach to mirror symmetry via homological algebra by Kontsevich mentioned above.",754809,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics; Philosophy and Religious Studies
The Universe Connected: Real-Time Analysis for the science drivers of the future,"My Future Leaders Fellowship has proven that analysing data in real-time before it is stored can increase the precision and reduce the costs associated with the enormous amounts of data produced by large-scale, cutting-edge science experiments. In my Fellowship continuation, I will apply the lessons learned in the first fellowship period to the future of Particle Physics experiments, where, in the quest to understand our universe, data rates are expected to be even larger. Traditionally, experiments have reconstructed particle collisions in 3D, providing an image of the collision which can be studied by analysts to look for new physics. As collisions become larger and more complicated, this reconstruction becomes increasingly challenging with current computing technologies. In my continuation I will add a fourth dimension, timing, to the real-time reconstruction of particle collisions in order to reduce this complexity and increase the precision to which we can probe the universe at the smallest scales. I will lead international R&D activities to study the way in which we process this data using commercially available technologies to ensure that future experiments can continue to process the wealth of data they are expected to produce.",753142,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Next Generation Water Cherenkov Detector Technology Development For The Study Of Supernova Neutrinos,"The research proposed for the FLF renewal grant covers and extension of the work originally undertaken in researching and developing new particle detection techniques for neutrinos and then applying them to the exciting study of neutrinos emitted from supernova, particularly those created at the beginning of the universe. These neutrinos are very interesting because they could tell us a lot about the rate and life cycle of star formation and the number of black holes in our universe all the way back to the big bang.

The initial award focused on the development of novel calibration hardware for measuring tiny contamination in water, new ultra-fast photo detector technology, advanced data acquisition systems, improved triggering, and analysis algorithms to exploit a brand-new technique of doping water based Cherenkov particle detectors with Gadolinium (Gd). These advances were then to be used on the current world's largest neutrino detector Super-Kamiokande (based in Japan) to help improve the search sensitivity for these extremely rare and ancient supernova neutrino interactions, allowing us to observe them for the first time ever.

Whilst this is still underway and we are eagerly looking forward to the results, the developments my group have worked on and the technology of Gd doping have also been employed on a number of other neutrino detectors to great success. These experiments with my help have produced multiple publications and advancements in many areas of science covering both hardware and software. We have also been able to produce a suite of novel synergistic software frameworks and tools to advance the field.
 
The renewal proposes to continue to develop these systems both hardware (in terms of calibration systems and photosensors) and software (for triggering, data acquisition, analysis and particle simulation), as well as bringing the current advances and techniques to the next generation of particle physics detectors that are currently being designed and will be constructed and operated in the renewal period. These experiments are based all over the world from the USA, Europe, Japan and even the UK and aim to be technology test beds for new advances in doping materials and photosensor technology, high precision test beds for making precision particle interaction measurements and in the case of Hyper-k the new world's largest international neutrino experiment, giving us the ability to peer deeper into the universe and study the fundamental properties of the neutrinos themselves. 

These detectors provide an invaluable opportunity, to develop ground breaking new tools and physics, furthering our understanding. This is particularly the case with the field of supernova neutrinos, where the FLF renewal grant will allow us to ensure that the technology and hardware is developed and in place for people to study them for decades to come and raise the profile of the UKs research excellence internationally as a founding member.",753142,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Engineering Future Quantum Technologies in Low-Dimensional Systems,"Quantum transport in low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures is a well-established field of research that has resulted in several landmark discoveries in solid-state physics over the past several decades. Among various findings, the one which stands out is the discovery of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) in 1980. The QHE was the first experimental demonstration of the quantum nature of the celebrated classical Hall effect. In the QHE, the transverse conductance of a two-dimensional electron gas is represented as (e^2/h).v, where v is the filling factor. The conductance shows remarkably flat plateaus for integer values of the filling factor. It may be noted that the transverse conductance or QHE is proportional to fundamental constants (e^2/h), and does not depend on the sample geometry or size, so is invariant. A pioneering theorist, R Laughlin proposed a theory describing the integer states in terms of a topological invariant, Chern number. In 1982, physicists working at Bell labs reported in the QHE measurements that new quantised plateaus appeared at fractional values of the filling factor, like 1/3. This remarkable discovery gave birth to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). The observation was due to electron-electron interactions in the two-dimensional electron gas in high-quality semiconductors under the influence of a strong quantising magnetic field. FQHE was the first demonstration in solid state physics that the quasiparticles formed at the extremely high magnetic field and very low temperatures would possess a fraction of an electronic charge, say, 1/3. Following the discovery of the FQHE, several experimental studies resulted in the discovery of more than 100 new fractional states. 

While FQHE/QHE was receiving considerable attention in the 80s, an exciting development took shape when Haldane in 1988 proposed the idea of QHE without any magnetic field using the tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice. He suggested that the existence of quantum Hall states do not necessarily require an external magnetic field, but depends on the symmetries of the system and its topological phases. This important contribution to the knowledge led to various discoveries, including the anomalous and Hall effects and topological insulators. 
 
It was shown in 1988 that conductance through a one-dimensional channel was quantised as (2e^2/h). N, where N is an integer. This was a remarkable observation and one of the significant discoveries in solid-state physics, that the conductance of 2D electrons, when confined to one dimension would quantise in units of fundamental constants (2e^2/h), a behaviour similar to the QHE although without any magnetic field. As FQHE was complementing the IQHE when electron-electron interactions were introduced, physicists wondered if there could be a fractional counterpart of the 1D integer conductance quantisation. This critical question in experimental physics remained unanswered until 2018/2019, when electrons in high-quality semiconductors based on GaAs showed fractional conductance quantisation in units of e^2/h at values 2/5,1/6, 1/2, etc. These new quantum states form when electrons in a 1D channel configure into a zigzag, enabling ""ring paths"" and ""cyclic currents"". These complex quantum phenomena result in fractional excitations which show promise for topological quantum computing schemes. 

This proposal aims to investigate the fractional quantum states formed in weakly confined 1D quantum wires, where several parameters play a significant role in achieving this unexpected quantum behaviour. We aim to investigate the nature of these new fractional quantum states and how their spin and charge phases could be measured and manipulated. These novel quantum states would be utilised to investigate entanglement via Aharonov-Bohn interferometry, spin blockage phenomena, fractional state selection via electron focusing, electronic charge via quantum shot noise measurements, etc.",752420,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics
Zooming in on feedback in active galaxies: The first high-resolution radio survey,"A super-massive black hole exists at the centre of almost every massive galaxy, but what role do they play in galaxy evolution? In about 10 percent of all galaxies, we observe energetic phenomena like outflows and jets of plasma that are powered by these black holes. When a galaxy shows these characteristics we call it an active galaxy, and refer to the black hole and its energetic output as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We know from both observations and cosmological simulations that feedback between an AGN and its host galaxy can have a significant impact on that galaxy's evolution. What we do not know are the details of how this AGN feedback works.

Observations of low-frequency radio emission are a powerful tool to pinpoint what is happening in AGN. This emission traces relativistic electrons in jets launched by a super-massive black hole and winds of outflowing material blown out into the galaxy by the super-massive black hole. However, due to their low spatial resolution, current radio surveys have difficulty distinguishing between this activity and radio emission from star formation. My FLF project overcomes this by using ultra-high spatial resolution radio observations, which rely on advanced calibration techniques I developed for the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), a unique array of radio antenna stations spread across Europe. LOFAR can be a smaller or a bigger 'lens' by using only some or all of the stations: the more we use, the higher the resolution that can be achieved, but this requires specialised calibration techniques. LOFAR is unique in that it can achieve high resolution across a field of view more than 20 times larger than any other similar resolution radio telescope, which is critical to build the large samples necessary to understand AGN activity.

My ongoing FLF project is to enact the first wide area, high resolution survey. I am doing this by post-processing data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The survey is recorded with all LOFAR antennas, but standard processing only uses those located in the Netherlands, providing lower resolution. Already I have demonstrated that we can make small high-resolution images (>20 times better than the standard processing) across the field of view, and guided the development of wide-field techniques that image the full field of view, although at a high computational cost.

Using these exciting new images, my initial scientific results include identifying an entirely new sample of galaxies where star formation and AGN activity have been simultaneously measured using a combination of these high-resolution and standard imaging techniques; this is the largest sample of its kind by two orders of magnitude. From this, we are already learning that the AGN contribution in faint galaxies is higher than previously thought, with implications for our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve, and this project will continue to quantify this to understand the role of AGN in galaxy evolution.

Conducting the first high-resolution survey across the entire Northern sky will allow me to build robust samples, the largest of their kind, to study the physical processes by which AGN produce radio emission, what properties govern these processes across large samples of galaxies, and how these processes impact the typical growth of galaxies through star formation. I will drive forward major advances in AGN feedback studies with my UKRI-FLF project, and push the field to new and exciting territory in answering fundamental astrophysical questions.

Over the next several years, my work will lay the foundation for future scientific surveys with the SKA, in which the UK has heavily invested. I will continue to develop international collaborations with SKA pathfinder teams in South Africa, the Netherlands, and India, while placing Durham and the UK at the forefront of this exciting new revolution in science.",752405,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Stellar Clusters as the Nurseries of Black Holes,"The last decade has seen several quantum leaps in our abilities to study black holes, from the detection of gravitational waves emitted by merging stellar black holes to the images of supermassive black holes taken by the Event Horizon Telescope. As is the case with every major discovery, these breakthroughs raised new questions that we need to answer: How do merging black holes find each other? How do supermassive black holes spring into existence and grow in mass? The answer to these questions may be found in star clusters, dense conglomerations of stars held together by their mutual gravitational forces. We observe star clusters in every major galaxy. In the Milky Way alone, well over a thousand clusters are known, from recently formed open clusters comprised of a few thousand stars to ancient globular clusters composed of several millions of stars. Deciphering the secrets of these star clusters and investigating their link to black holes is the aim of this project.

Black holes form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fusion ""fuel"" and collapse under their own gravity. This final episode in the life of a massive star is often accompanied by a bright supernova, visible across intergalactic distances. However, not every massive star will end its life as a black hole. Some are expected to lose most of their mass through powerful winds, whereas others are completely disrupted in the supernova explosions. To complicate matters even further, many massive stars live in binary systems and their fates are altered when they donate mass to their companions. To advance our understanding of the evolution of massive stars, we study them in their natural habitats, namely young star clusters. By measuring their chemical compositions and their velocities using spectroscopy, we determine whether they live in binary systems and whether they have already shed material to their companions. We are also on the hunt for stars that are paired with black holes, as such systems reveal crucial information about the conditions required to form black holes.

Star clusters are not only considered as a primary site for the formation of black holes, but also for their subsequent growth. In these highly dynamic environments, black holes can pair up and merge, resulting in gravitational wave emission and potentially in the growth of black holes that are heavier than even their most massive stellar progenitors. Such ""intermediate-mass"" black holes are considered as potential seeds from which the supermassive ones observed in the centres of galaxies evolve. This scenario has recently gained in credibility through the discovery that some of the most massive clusters we have found might in fact be the surviving nuclei of galaxies that were accreted by the Milky Way in the past. Indeed, our research has already revealed strong evidence for the presence of a massive black hole in at least one of these clusters. In this project, we are using additional observations to verify this finding and study similar clusters to determine the occurrence rate of intermediate-mass black holes.",752192,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Ionic liquids for subtractive and additive nanomanufacturing,"I propose investigating the use of ionic liquids for materials treatment, specifically in nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at molecular scales close to one billionth of a meter. Progress in manufacturing at this scale has enabled the fabrication of modern electronic and biomedical technologies. However, more advanced processes are required to manufacture even faster computers, better drug delivery systems, and many other future technologies. In this project, ionic liquids will be used to access new options for these manufacturing processes. These exciting new liquids have been developed over the last two decades for a range of chemistry and energy storage applications. Ionic liquids consist entirely of charged complex molecules (ions) at room temperature, which allows for a new approach to nanotechnology manufacturing with a device known as an Ionic Liquid Ion Source (ILIS). In an ILIS, the ionic liquid covers a sharp needle. By applying a high voltage to this needle, it is possible to produce a beam of ions from the liquid. This spray can be directed towards a material for treatment. Different ion combinations would be available for various materials processing applications, as ionic liquids have been extensively studied, and hundreds of stable compositions have been discovered. For example, the beam can contain reactive ions, and can be used to remove material from silicon, a common material used in microprocessors. Varying the beam conditions and composition can allow for both the erosion of material (subtractive method) and the deposition of a thin film on the surface or to create a structure (additive method). I will explore the interactions of the ILIS beam with different materials, study the use of ILIS for material removal and deposition, and investigate the possibility of focusing the beam of ILIS for careful processing of materials at the nanoscale. 

In the first stage of this fellowship (2020-2024) a vacuum chamber was constructed; this chamber is being used for detailed characterization of emission from different ionic liquids. ILIS beams are comprised of several different ion types, and so a filter is being used to separate these components. The separate ion types are being fired towards a variety of materials to understand how specific ions react with different targets. These fundamental studies are being complemented by experiments that use an ILIS to remove material and create a nanoscale pattern. Additional experiments can be performed with an array of ILIS devices, in order to achieve higher throughput. The possibility of depositing thin films of ionic liquids from an ILIS beam is also under study. The fellowship is developing a focused ion beam (FIB) from an ILIS; FIB machines take the beam of particles from an ion source and focus the particles onto a nanometre sized-spot on a target, thus allowing localized modifications to a sample. Computer simulations are being used to design a bespoke focusing setup in which the ILIS is being installed.

In the renewal stage of the fellowship (2024-2027), experiments will be undertaken to quantify how well the ILIS-FIB beam is focused, using different ionic liquids and different operating conditions in the focusing setup. The ILIS-FIB platform will be used in several applications, for instance microscopy or precise milling at the nanoscale. Another avenue of research will be to study the possibility of creating three-dimensional nanostructures by depositing material with the focused ion beam of ionic liquid particles.",752125,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
A Pathway to the Confirmation and Characterisation of Habitable Alien Worlds,"Are we alone in the Universe? Since the confirmation of the first planets outside our solar system in the 1990s, we have made tremendous progress towards answering this question. Yet, the confirmation of a true Earth-analogue still evades us. On top of this, if we are truly to understand the origins of life in the cosmos, we must also create a complete picture of planetary formation, evolution, and habitability.

However, each of these aspects necessitates a detailed knowledge of solar-type stars. This is because we study exoplanets indirectly by analysing their much more luminous host stars. For example, most planet confirmation relies on the Doppler wobble of the host star, induced by the planet. Moreover, we can learn about a planet's dynamical history from mapping its projected orbit as it transits its host star. Hence, stellar surface inhomogeneities can impact planetary interpretations, and can completely swamp the signals from rocky worlds. My research aims to overcome these hurdles. For this, my team studies stellar surfaces from a two-pronged approach: with state-of-the-art 3D simulations and using transiting planets to empirically probe stellar surfaces.

I aim to understand and disentangle a fundamental barrier on the pathway to confirming other Earths: the stellar surface inhomogeneities from convection. Planet confirmation requires a mass measurement, which can be determined from the Doppler shift of the absorption lines in the stellar atmosphere. However, all Sun-like stars are enveloped in boiling plasma, causing hot bubbles of plasma to rise to the surface (inducing blueshifts), where they cool and fall down into the surrounding regions (inducing redshifts). The net result is spurious velocity shifts up to a m/s - completely swamping the tiny signal of an Earth- twin, which is a mere 9 cm/s. These shifts can be even larger if regions of magnetic field concentrate and inhibit the convection. As the next generation spectrographs continue to come online, we are entering an era where it is technologically feasible to confirm Earth-twins. With the launch of the PLATO mission in 2026, primed to provide such candidates, and the Terra Hunting Survey commencing late 2024, equipped to confirm such worlds, this work is extremely time critical.

The Sun has shown us convection does not easily average out; we must disentangle its signature to find Earth-like worlds. To do this, my team uses 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to create realistic model stars. With these, we study precisely how convection alters stellar lines, and work to optimise stellar noise reduction techniques. My present work on Solar- analogues indicates we can use the curvature of the stellar lines to remove this noise, but will this work for hotter or cooler stars? How do noise diagnostics behave if a star has a patchy distribution of magnetic field? Which lines are most sensitive to the convection and magnetic fields? These are some of the questions my research aims to answer.

Of course, these diagnostics are only as reliable as their underlying simulations. I have pioneered a new technique, using transiting planets as probes, to validate these for the first time for main-sequence stars other than the Sun. By subtracting in- from out-of-transit observations, we isolate the starlight behind the planet. With this, we can study the convection behaviour, stellar differential rotation, and determine the 3D trajectory of a planet's orbit - a key feature in understanding its formation and evolution. By applying this technique to a range of systems are able to validate the simulations, quantify the impact of convection on planetary dynamic measurements, and contribute to a more global understanding of planet formation and evolution.

With this 2-pronged approach, I aim to push the frontiers of astronomy towards the future confirmation and characterisation of habitable alien worlds, and help answer whether or not we are truly alone in the Universe.",751883,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Revealing the Pattern of Solar Alfvénic Waves (RiPSAW),"This research proposal aims to advance our understanding of the physics of our closest star, the Sun, and other solar-like stars. The Sun displays a number of fascinating and dynamic phenomena such as powerful solar flares and giant, planet-sized concentrations of magnetic fields (sunspots). It also provides a unique opportunity to examine in detail how other stars behave. The Sun is made of a plasma (ionised gas) threaded by a strong magnetic field. Such magnetised plasmas are common throughout the universe (e.g. active galaxy nuclei, nebula, interstellar medium), hence the research will also aid advances across multiple research communities. 

Many stars possess their own weather systems, although these systems are extreme compared to those we experience on Earth. In our solar system, a hot, million degree wind blows off the Sun at colossal speeds reaching millions of miles per hour, washing over the planets. While we are under the protection of the Earth's magnetic field, that deflects the Sun's wind, other planetary bodies in the solar system have been exposed to its influence. For example, the Sun's wind is known to have stripped Mars of its atmosphere. Scientists are also interested in how these winds will influence the habitability of exoplanets around other Sun-like stars. These winds also contribute to how the stars evolve, with the Sun losing over 10 trillion tonnes of material each year via its winds. 

The objectives of the RiPSAW project are to examine the generation of the hot plasma and powerful winds, focusing on the role of magnetic waves. These magnetic (or Alfvén) waves can transfer energy through a star's atmosphere and are considered an important feature of any magnetic star. During the initial phase of RiPSAW, Dr Morton and his research team pioneered techniques for estimating properties of the magnetic waves. The renewal of the RiPSAW project will see these tools advanced to examine if there is evidence for wave turbulence in the Sun's corona. Turbulence is one possible mechanism for explaining the heating and acceleration of the winds. Hence the proposed work may transform our understanding of how these hot winds behave.

To address the fundamental challenges, RiPSAW makes use of advanced mathematical techniques and cutting-edge computer simulations to create models of the Sun based on magnetohydrodynamics. We combine this theoretical effort with the highest quality data of the Sun available from state-of-the-art solar instruments (e.g. National Solar Observatory's DKIST - the world's newest and largest solar telescope); incorporating information from across the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. infrared, EUV) and analysing this with modern methods drawn from statistics and machine learning.",751819,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
CAREER: New Synthetic Approaches to Engineering Topology: from Quantum Many-Body Rydberg Atom Arrays to Classical Mechanical Networks,"Transport (moving something from one position to another) is central to describing many important phenomena in the physical sciences. In physics, there remain open challenges to understanding how physical quantities like charge, heat, and even information evolve and undergo transport in systems of many interacting particles, especially when quantum effects are taken into account. Recently, new approaches to the study of transport in quantum systems have emerged based on the concepts of ""synthetic dimensions"" and ""synthetic lattices,"" in which our normal picture of transport in real space is abstracted to the transport of population in a space spanned by the internal states of small quantum systems such as individual atoms or molecules. For example, population can ""move"" between the electronic states of an atom (like hydrogen) through the absorption of light from an incident laser field. In this way, a collection of atoms, which is well-understood and highly controllable with lasers or other electromagnetic fields, can be used to ""simulate"" a more complex condensed matter system, and lead to advances in our understanding of the complex system. The experimental effort in the current project will extend this type of approach to the study of transport to a new regime of strong inter-particle interactions. The team will conduct experiments based on samples of atoms that can be individually controlled and detected at the microscopic level. Microwave electromagnetic fields will be used to precisely control the transport of population between states of the atoms, allowing for new kinds of explorations into transport phenomena. Additionally, the team will lead an effort to broaden the scope and impact of undergraduate research opportunities, with a primary emphasis on increasing the participation of members from underrepresented groups. This effort will focus on building a new, undergraduate student-led research project on networks of mechanical oscillators that are coupled by ""synthetic,"" or engineered and indirect, forces. This effort will incorporate undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in cutting-edge research related to new kinds of transport phenomena, and will use these human-scale experiments to generate visualization video content that will be utilized for outreach and instruction. This project builds on previous work designing synthetic lattices in neutral atoms and photons, extending these ideas to a new platform for the exploration of many-body transport phenomena based on the internal degrees of freedom of ultracold Rydberg atoms. By considering the problem of quantum transport taking place in an internal state space (driven by coherent microwave transitions and strong dipole-dipole interactions) rather than real space, this approach leverages the ability to manipulate internal degrees of freedom with spectroscopic control. This spectroscopic control allows for the precise engineering of synthetic lattices with nontrivial band topology, kinetic frustration, and tunable disorder. Resonant dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms will lead to new phenomena with relevance to the interplay of topology and strong interactions, to the study of relaxation and thermalization in isolated interacting disordered systems, and perhaps to the emergence of entirely new forms of many-body phenomena. The research team will explore the ability to engineer novel synthetic lattice models in the internal state space of Rydberg atoms, and will explore how resonant dipole-dipole interactions lead to new many-body phenomena in these synthetic lattices. An additional effort related to broadening the scope and impact of undergraduate research will lead a project to create topological lattice models based on synthetically-coupled oscillator networks. This research effort will enable new functionality of engineered mechanical networks, including new capabilities for designing non-reciprocity, artificial gauge fields, disorder, and strong nonlinearities. The undergraduate led research team will use these newly developed methods to study transport phenomena in new classes of mechanical oscillator networks. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",751751,2024,2025,NSF,United States,United States,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
ABaQuS: Advanced Barium Quantum Systems,"Quantum computers will be able to solve hard computational problems that are beyond the reach of our best classical supercomputers. Over the last 10 years progress on quantum computing has dramatically accelerated and has transitioned from an academic field to a thriving industry. However, we are only at the beginning of the journey towards mass-adoption of large scale, reliable, and high-performance quantum computers.

The great challenge now for quantum computing is to significantly decrease the computational error rate in a way that maintains performance with scale. One of the most promising ways of building quantum computers is with trapped ions - ionised atoms are one of the most perfect quantum systems known, and can be controlled by elements than can be integrated into classical silicon chips.

In this project we will combine a recently identified new barium qubit to tackle three of the major areas limiting significant improvements in quantum computer performance and adoption: We will develop new qubit modalities, and control methods, opening to door to more efficient hardware scaling approaches, we will develop techniques and associated device engineering to integrate these new qubit modalities into chips that can be built in a standard semiconductor foundry, and we will holistically-optimise the compilation of quantum algorithms for these devices in order to maximise the performance we can achieve with near-term hardware.",751615,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Spacecraft Fireball in the Laboratory - Recreating Atmospheric Flight,"This project is intended to enable future space exploration missions into our Solar System that have not been possible before. Re-entering spacecraft are exposed to extreme heat loads, which are mitigated by heat shields that continuously burn-up during flight. However, the physical processes of the extreme high-speed flow around the vehicle, and the influence of the ablating heat shield on the flow are still not well understood and result in exorbitant safety margins for the heat shield mass. Heat shields become too heavy and prevent missions that suffer from high heat loads like planet exploration or sample return scenarios. 

The project will utilise a newly developed ground-testing architecture to re-create this flight situation in a laboratory. A plasma-generator will heat sub-scaled models of re-entry capsules to extreme temperatures, as experienced in flight. After this phase, the model will start to decompose due to pyrolysis reactions inside the heat shield material. As a final step, the model will be exposed to a hypervelocity flow. This retains the characteristics of an ablation-flow coupling and allows for the first time a real ablating scaled model in an aerodynamically similar flow, enabling the investigation of physical effects that were previously inaccessible. The so created laboratory experiment allows us to investigate the flow and material response and therefore gives us insight into the physical and chemical effects occurring during re-entry.

Several of these experiments are planned with varying test model size, temperature, material, and external flow condition. The flow around the models will be investigated using laser absorption spectroscopy and optical emission spectroscopy. The former of these techniques allows the measurement of temperature and concentration of the nitric oxide molecule, which is a strong indicator for the thermal and chemical state of the flow. The latter technique gives insight into various species and enables the measurement of excitation temperatures of different molecules and atoms. The combination of these approaches results a highly detailed characterisation of the flow around ablating test models. These data are extremely valuable for developing physical models of high-temperature flows, which in turn allows a better design of spacecraft and hypersonic vehicles. I will target flow conditions that replicate high-speed Earth re-entry, such as encountered during the re-entry of the US Space Shuttle or the European IXV mission.

The final step in this programme is to use the gathered data of sub-scaled spacecraft models to develop a new theory relating ground-tests to flight scenarios. This endeavor will be accomplished by three interlinked methods. 1) A formulation of an analytical description of the problem utilising first principles of heat and mass transfer, fluid mechanics, and chemical kinetics. 2) The utilisation of the created experimental data spanning a large range of different conditions faced by spacecraft re-entry to ensure generality of the developed scaling approach. 3) A set of detailed numerical simulations rebuilding the experiments and beyond. These simulations will furthermore provide insight into flow physics not captured by the optical diagnostics, complementing the holistic methodology. This methodology will be used to identify dominating physical mechanisms, non-dimensionalise the problem, and generate a new ground-to-flight extrapolation theory that allows us to relate the ablating boundary layer flows directly to flight scenarios.",751605,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Space Sciences
Nuclear deformation and symmetry breaking from an ab-initio perspective,"The nucleus, consisting of protons and neutrons and lying at the center of the atom, is the lynchpin of all elements on Earth. Knowing how those protons and neutrons arrange themselves is important in order to understand our origins. One of the most powerful tests of nuclear physics is how the organization of the protons and neutrons changes as their numbers become imbalanced: when there are many more protons than neutrons (or the opposite). In order to understand this, world-class experimental facilities are being developed around the world. My work will focus on two new facilities based in North America: ARIEL in Canada, and FRIB in the United States. At these facilities ""exotic"" nuclei will be produced, with large differences in the numbers of protons and neutrons. This will be done by smashing together common nuclei, such as isotopes of calcium and xenon, causing them to break apart into the very rare nuclei which I will study. My research will have two primary focuses: how the shapes of exotic nuclei change, and how protons and neutrons behave relative to one another deep inside a nucleus. 

The nucleus can contain many tens or even hundreds of protons and neutrons. These ""nucleons"" can arrange themselves into many shapes, from footballs, to rugby-balls, disks, or even pears. Because these shapes require all of the nucleons to act as one they are incredibly powerful tests of our understanding - we need to know what every single proton and neutron is doing in order to understand the shape. I will measure these shapes for exotic nuclei, helping us understand how the protons and neutrons behave when they are very imbalanced in number. 

The question of how the proton and neutron behave relative to one another inside a nucleus is something else I will investigate. As nuclear physicists we have found historically that the proton and neutron actually behave very similarly inside the nucleus. This means that a nucleus with five protons and four neutrons behaves very similarly to a nucleus with four protons and five neutrons, which is a remarkable result. What I will investigate is how well this behaviour holds up as we add more and more protons and neutrons to the nucleus. This is a very significant question for a number of reasons, with implications for our understanding of how elements evolve when stars explode.

Nuclear physics is a very exciting field, with a number of open questions. The incredibly powerful next-generation facilities that I will be using will shed light on a number of these questions and, in all likelihood, open up a number of new exciting ones in the process.",751462,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Using neutrinos to unravel the mysteries of the universe,"Neutrinos are the least understood particles we know of. They have extremely small mass and rarely interact, yet they are extremely abundant and critical for our universe's evolution. Neutrinos come in three flavours (electron, muon and tau neutrinos), and since the 1990s, we have known that a neutrino can change its flavour as it travels. This phenomenon is called neutrino oscillations. There are still two big questions left to address about neutrinos. The first is that, surprisingly, we do not yet know which is the lightest neutrino-finding that the third neutrino is heavier than the other two would have implications for many Grand Unified Theories that seek to explain particle interactions as different manifestations of a single force. If that is not the case, how we think about the natural forces in the universe will be completely changed. 
The second question is whether neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate in the same way. Answering this question might solve one of the biggest mysteries about the universe's origin: the Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, but today, everything around us, from the smallest microorganism to the largest stellar object, is made almost entirely by matter. If neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate following different rules, they might be the reason why the universe evolved to be dominated by matter rather than antimatter, hence allowing the existence of stars, planets and even us.

This award allowed me to use a coherent strategy to start solving these two mysteries, following the ambitious programme of the two best equipped experiments to answer them: NOvA and DUNE. NOvA is a world-leading long baseline neutrino experiment: an intense beam of muon neutrinos is produced at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), near Chicago, and directed 810 km away towards Minnesota. NOvA uses a near and a far detector to measure the flavour of the neutrinos produced at FNAL, and the flavour of the neutrinos that arrive in Minnesota. DUNE is the future world flagship experiment for neutrino oscillation measurements. It is fully funded, approved by the US Department of Energy, and currently in construction. DUNE will use the intense muon neutrino beam from FNAL and direct it 1300 km away towards South Dakota. DUNE will use a more powerful beam, a much bigger far detector, and better detector technology than NOvA.
While the first part of the fellowship focussed on making neutrino interaction measurements, the renewal proposal focusses on their impact on neutrino oscillation analyses and the development of specific techniques for measuring neutrino oscillation parameters. As neutrinos can only be detected when they interact with the matter in the detector and produce other particles, theoretical neutrino interaction models are currently the cause of the most significant systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation analyses. My strategy is to exploit the measurements made during the first part of the fellowship to make these experiments more sensitive to neutrino oscillation parameters - my team and I will do this both within the NOvA experiment and the NOvA-T2K joint oscillation analysis. With significant more data than the previous version of these analyses, these experiments have the potential to understand which neutrino is the lightest. Focussing on the future of neutrino experiments, my team and I will develop a new statistical technique to extract neutrino oscillation parameters, to ensure we hit the ground running once DUNE starts taking data. Finally, we will play a leading role in the installation of the DUNE far detector and perform checks to ensure the data taken is of the highest quality. All of these objectives will ensure that my team and I are at the forefront of these neutrino ground-breaking discoveries.",751321,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Robust Many-body Quantum Phenomena Through Driving And Dissipation,"The individual electrons in a metal, or the qubits in a quantum computer, are subject to peculiar but well-understood quantum mechanical laws. But metals/quantum computers have many electrons/qubits respectively and they all interact with one another, giving rise to a very complicated system. By implication, if you really want to understand a material or the operations of a quantum computer, you must grapple with the following question: What behaviours emerge when many quantum bodies (i.e., spins, electrons, qubits) interact with one another? The answer is fascinating. Surprising new behaviours can emerge due to both the complexity of many-body systems and the strangeness of the underlying quantum mechanical laws, and the continuing effort to chart this terrain accounts for two vast intersecting fields: condensed matter and quantum information theory.

One insight from the study of condensed matter is that many-body systems are organised into phases. In addition to the prosaic (liquids, solids, gases) there's an ever-growing list of exotic quantum phases including superconductors and topological orders, many of which are useful. Much of condensed matter is dedicated to the search for new phases, and here it intersects with quantum information theory. For example, discovering new phases can help us to design more robust quantum computers, which may one day revolutionise computation (and will produce interesting physics in the mean-time). Indeed, the topological orders mentioned above now form the backbone of the most prominent digital quantum computers.

This fellowship extension focusses on two themes within this area.

1) Find and characterise new open quantum phases

The theoretical search for new phases has tended to assume that they are in thermal equilibrium. We aim to find new phases which emerge when we remove that assumption, and subject the system to driving, measurement, and dissipation. This is a timely question because the resulting so-called ""non-equilibrium"" or ""open"" systems describe well the conditions in a modern quantum simulator. Open systems are relatively understudied, but we already know that they can give rise to qualitatively new behaviours which can neither be realised in equilibrium nor in classical systems. We also now know more about the mechanisms that stabilise these phases, due to progress made in the first part of the fellowship. Going forward, our aim is to find and characterise new open quantum phases. The payoff is that if you find a new phase, then you have identified a new robust -- hence potentially useful -- quantum phenomenon. For example, new such phases may prove useful for protecting quantum information from noise, which is the main barrier to performing useful quantum computations. 

2) Develop and use new classical (and quantum) algorithms for simulating many-body systems 

Transport properties (e.g., charge conductivity), are among the most practically important features of materials. Yet our ability to predict these properties from first principles in interacting quantum matter has until recently been limited. In the first part of the fellowship we used insights gleaned from quantum information theory to develop a new such technique (called `DAOE'), which efficiently simulates quantum transport in a range of systems, and which can probe transport in previously inaccessible regimes. This fellowship extension will further develop the algorithm, make an optimised version of it publicly available, and use it to understand new physics and experiments. DAOE is presently run on classical computers, but we will also explore the possibility of running analogous software on a quantum computer. The result may greatly enhance our ability to use quantum computers to predict experiments and, ultimately, the properties of materials.",751307,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Bcc-superalloys: Engineering Resilience to Extreme Environments,"Nuclear fusion, Generation IV fission reactors and aerospace gas turbines are critical to our future energy generation and transportation. Their operation at high temperatures necessitates construction from a variety of advanced materials. In order to withstand these extreme environments materials require high melting points, high temperature strength and environmental resistance, and, for nuclear, irradiation resistance. There are strong environmental and economic incentives to yet further increase the temperature capability of the materials used, in order to improve efficiency to reduce fuel use, as well as for improve performance, design life and safety. However, while iterative improvements are being made year on year the temperature gains are becoming ever harder to realise. In this Future Leaders Fellowship a step change in temperature capability is sought by the realisation of a new class of body-centred-cubic (bcc, an atomic crystal structure) superalloys based on (1) Tungsten, (2) Titanium, and (3) Steel, for the extreme environments of nuclear fusion and gen IV fission reactors as well as aerospace gas turbine engines.

I have created a close network of industrial, national and international academic partners, that will enable translation of these advanced materials from concept through to scale-up. The collaborations will be split across the bcc-superalloys Work Packages: (WP1) Tungsten, linking in UKAEA, toward nuclear fusion and Gen IV fission; (WP2) Titanium, for aero-engines, working with Rolls Royce and TIMET; (WP3) Steels, part of a collaboration with UKAEA, Bangor University and University of Manchester.

Bcc superalloys comprise a metal matrix, where the atoms are arranged in a bcc crystal structure, which are reinforced by forming precipitates of high strength ordered-bcc intermetallic compounds (e.g. TiFe or NiAl). This has parallels to the strategy used in current face-centred-cubic (fcc) nickel-based superalloys. However, changing the base metal's crystal structure, and therefore also the reinforcing intermetallic compound, represents a fundamental redesign and necessitates the development of new understanding. The key advantage of using a bcc refractory-metal-, titanium-, or steel- based superalloy is their increased melting point(s), which give the possibility of increased operating temperatures, as well as greatly reduced cost for the case of steels. However, the change in crystal structure requires a fundamentally new design strategy. While the limited investigations into bcc superalloys have indicated that they have attractive strength, and creep resistance, they have been held back by their low ductility. During this fellowship, I will thoroughly investigate multiple ductilisation strategies on bcc-superalloys to advance their technology readiness level (TRL) and so remove the current barrier to their commercialisation.",751273,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
CAREER: Correlated Excitons in Semiconducting Moire Superlattices,"Non-technical abstract: Fundamental particles can be classified into fermions and bosons, which have distinct collective behaviors. Interactions between electrons, a fermion, results in now well known emergent properties. On the other hand, creation of unconventional bosonic matter has been challenging since bosons in natural materials are often weakly-interacting and/or short-lived. This project bridges this gap by creating unconventional bosonic matter using excitons in semiconducting moiré superlattices. Compared to existing platforms such as cold atoms and quantum wells, this platform offers orders-of-magnitude higher temperature scale (tens of Kelvin vs. <1 Kelvin) and scalability (>10000 particles vs. ~100 particles). Research is incorporated into a broad outreach plan under the theme of “Science as a Lego game”. Leveraging the Lego-like nature of optical setups, integrated outreach activities are targeted at students at many educational levels to demystify quantum science and introduce them to potential career options. Specific activities include designing a high-school lab-based class series on building optical modules and a Saturday class on optics in quantum science; initiating a summer research intern program for undergraduate students; and organizing a quantum science summer school for graduate students and postdocs. Technical abstract: Condensed matter physics aims to understand how interactions endow simple elementary particle building blocks with complex emergent phenomena. Exotic quantum phases of fermionic electrons have been intensively studied in solid-state systems, including recently in moiré superlattices. However, collective bosonic states have remained the purview of ultra-cold atoms due to the lack of suitable condensed matter platforms and experimental probes. This project aims to overcome both challenges and establishe excitons in semiconducting moiré superlattices -- bosons composed of tightly bound electron-hole pairs -- as a platform for engineering exotic collective states of interacting bosons. The principal investigator is developing a set of novel pump- probe spectroscopies that enables direct measurement of exciton compressibility, isolating low energy “charge” and “spin” excitations of excitons, as well as investigating their dynamics. This allows identification and investigation of a plethora of exotic bosonic phases such as bosonic Wigner crystal, Mott-superfluid transition, valley pseudospin exchange interactions and pseudospin orders, etc. This project forges a path to a new class of “quantum exitonic materials” where exotic properties and novel device concepts arise from strongly correlated bosons, thereby establishing a new fundamental pillar of condensed matter alongside the extensively studied quantum electronic materials.

CAREER: Experimental and Computational Studies of Biomolecular Topology,"NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY Everything we make, we make out of atoms or molecules. We have a good understanding of how atoms and simple molecules behave, but it is harder to understand more complicated molecules. Some of the more complicated molecules are connected in ways that simpler molecules aren’t. Where simple molecules might connect like Lego bricks, more complicated molecules might connect like links on a chain. The challenge is that molecules are very small, too small to see with a microscope, and too fast to record with a camera. We overcome this challenge in two ways. One is by using bigger molecules. DNA is best known for containing our genetic code, but it’s also just an extremely large molecule that we can study in a microscope. We can do experiments with DNA to learn about how molecules behave, and apply those lessons to smaller molecules. For example, we measure how stretchy a single DNA molecule is, and use that information to understand how the molecules that make up rubber become stretchy. The other way is to use computer simulations, which can show us how molecules would behave if we could see them. The main molecules studied in this project are called kinetoplasts, which are like medieval chainmail armor made of thousands of connected loops of DNA. We study these with a microscope, and with computer simulations, to understand how much smaller chainmail-like molecules, which chemists are now learning to make, would behave. In the future, our understanding of chemical chainmail molecules could allow newer, fancier materials and nanomachines created atom by atom, if we first understand DNA chainmail. We will also teach a new generation of students to study molecules, by having them take microscopic videos of droplets full of molecules as they evaporate. Since nobody has observed those specific molecules evaporating in that way before, the students will learn what it’s like to discover something new, in addition to learning how to do the experiments. As part of the educational aspects of this grant, students at a minority-serving primarily-undergraduate institution will carry out original research as part of a course-based undergraduate research experience. The experience of a new discovery will build a sense of belonging in the scientific community and support their identities as scientists rather than just science students. TECHNICAL SUMMARY The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between molecule topology and material properties of complex biopolymers through single-molecule experiments and coarse-grained simulations. Biopolymers serve as a mesoscopic system on the micron scale analogous to synthetic polymers on the nanometer scale. The experiments will largely focus on single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Kinetoplasts, which are planar networks of topologically linked DNA, will be studied as a model system for synthetic polycatenanes and thermalized graphene. In particular, we are interested in how the topology of then network, which can be tuned by the action of enzymes, effects the elastic response to kinetoplasts in microfluidic shear flow. We will also develop assays to use genomic-length DNA as a tracer polymer in active fluids, which drive their own internal complex flows through the conversion of chemical energy. The fluctuations and conformations of the molecule will be used to determine how life-like systems approach and avoid maximum-entropy states, establishing rules that help us understand the physics of life. Additionally, we will explore the use of partial denaturation (a topological change in linear DNA) to improve nanopore genomic mapping technology. Simulations will use Langevin dynamics and gradient optimization to study the relationship between the topology of molecular chainmail and the large-scale structure of the sheets that they form, as well as to investigate the relationship between denaturation transitions and knotted molecular topologies. As part of the broader impacts of this grant, students at a minority-serving primarily-undergraduate institution will carry out original research as part of a course-based undergraduate research experience, initially studying nematic liquid crystals in Marangoni flow. The experience of a new discovery will build a sense of belonging in the scientific community and support their identities as scientists rather than just science students.

Connecting the lifecycles of galaxies and their central black holes,"Understanding why galaxies - including our own galaxy, the Milky Way - look the way they do is a vital part of our mission to understand the Universe around us. At the centre of most, if not all, galaxies (including the Milky Way) lies a supermassive black hole, with a mass that is millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. These black holes appear to be crucial component of galaxies, determining much of their structure and evolution, although how and why is still unclear. As a Future Leaders Fellow, my team and I are determining how these black holes grow, when this growth occurs within the lifecycle of a galaxy, and how these black holes affect the galaxies they lie in.

Galaxies have long lives. They evolve slowly as the gas within them forms stars, these stars age over billions of years, and the overall shape and structure of a galaxy gradually changes. By comparison, the massive black holes at their centres appear to grow relatively rapidly, in short-lived ""growth spurts"" lasting at most a few million years. During these growth spurts, material falls towards the black hole, heats up and can produce huge amounts of radiation spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. A galaxy with such a growing black hole is described as having an ""active galactic nucleus"" or AGN. Over recent years, astronomers have started to understand the structure of the material close to a black hole that forms an AGN and how these structures produce radiation at different wavelengths - including X-rays, optical and infrared light and radio emission. These structures result in a wide range of observed phenomena in different galaxies, all of which can be associated with an AGN powered by a growing supermassive black hole. However, we do not know how these structures change over millions of years or longer for an individual AGN, over timescales relevant for galaxy evolution.

My team and I are developing new techniques to connect the lifecycles of galaxies and their central black holes, probing timescales of millions to billions of years. Our studies reveal how material is brought into the centre of a galaxy, how this material forms an AGN, how the AGN changes and eventually fades over the course of many millions of years, what impact the AGN has on the galaxy during this time, and how often this whole process repeats throughout the lifetime of a galaxy.

Studying processes on such long timescales is extremely challenging. We cannot watch a single galaxy over this time, so instead, we are using new surveys of the sky that provide ""snapshots"" of many millions of galaxies and their AGN, each at a different life stage. We have developed new methods to extract information from these static snapshots and are building new models to describe the lifecycles of individual AGN and explain what we see in these snapshots. We are also studying the properties of galaxies with (and without) AGN to determine whether certain types of galaxies are more likely to have an AGN. In doing so, we can determine which physical mechanisms within galaxies are responsible for driving material into their central regions and fuelling the periods of AGN activity. Our work combines data from an array of new astronomical surveys. We are using new surveys that are underway with the premier ground-based telescopes, measuring the spectrum of light from large samples of galaxies that is imprinted with vital information on their lifecycles, combined with new X-ray imaging of the sky provided by the recently launched eROSITA telescope as well as existing infrared data and new surveys at radio wavelengths that can be combined to track the variation in AGN structure within these galaxies.",750144,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Unique Application of High Energy Density Plasmas for Nuclear Astrophysics Experiments,"This award supports a study of how the nuclei of chemical elements are formed in astrophysical environments by using high energy lasers in a laboratory. Nuclear reactions play key roles in the dynamics and evolution of our universe. They are responsible for forming the basic elements that make up everything we see around us – including the simplest hydrogen atoms, the oxygen we breathe, metals such as iron and heavy elements such as uranium - through nucleosynthesis processes in stars and during the Big Bang. However, nuclear reactions cannot be measured directly in space. To solve outstanding questions about abundances of elements in the universe, we have to know how these reactions happen under different conditions. Historically, experiments to test the likelihood of different reactions have been done using accelerators. However, accelerators use solid or gaseous targets. In stars, matter is found in a plasma state, where the atoms are split into their charged constituents, ions and electrons. Scientists have reasons to believe that reaction probabilities will be different in plasmas compared to solid or gaseous targets. The present work uses large lasers, such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF), to create plasmas where the reactions can be studied in an environment comparable to that in stars. The project will support an international collaboration with Imperial College London and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), training of graduate students and a postdoc, and may advance the development of fusion energy and contribute to national security. This effort is expected to improve the understanding of how elements are formed in the universe by answering questions about plasma effects on nuclear reaction probabilities that have never before been addressed experimentally. In doing so, it will contribute to the goals of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"" meta-program. The project focuses on the use of high-energy-density (HED) plasmas for basic nuclear science experiments relevant to nuclear astrophysics. High energy laser facilities such as OMEGA at the University of Rochester and the NIF at LLNL can create the stellar-like HED experimental conditions in a laboratory setting. Unlike the more traditional accelerator-based approached, the laser-driven HED conditions more closely mimic astrophysical environments in several ways, including thermal distributions of the reacting ions as opposed to monoenergetic ion beams; stellar-relevant plasma temperatures and densities; and, in the case of NIF, neutron flux densities not found anywhere else on earth. This represents a unique opportunity for understanding plasma effects on nuclear reactions. Fully exploiting this platform for nucleosynthesis experiments is anticipated to be a broad, decades-long effort. The goal of the current effort is to advance the frontier through new experimental projects. In particular, four areas will be addressed: (1) using new diagnostic capabilities to uniquely study six-nucleon systems with three particles in the final state, such as those relevant to the solar proton-proton cycles; (2) development of a platform for studying reactions involving mid-Z ions relevant to the stellar carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) catalyzed proton-burning cycles; (3) making strides toward the first terrestrial measurements of plasma screening of nuclear reactions; and (4) development of a platform for use of high-performing NIF implosions to study neutron capture on nuclei in excited states.

Reactor Antineutrino Physics with JUNO,"The primary goal of this work is to play a leading role in the production of the first scientific results from the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) and to involve high school teachers and their students directly in this research. Neutrinos are elementary particles that provide insight into the fundamental makeup of our world and the sources that produce them. JUNO is an international experiment featuring a 20,000-ton liquid scintillator neutrino target observed by over 43,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and surrounded by 35,000 tons of ultrapure water. By studying the disappearance of reactor antineutrinos from eight nuclear reactors at a baseline of about 53 km, JUNO aims to determine the order of neutrino masses and measure three parameters driving neutrino oscillation with approximately one order of magnitude better precision than currently available. JUNO will also break new ground in the search for new physics and the study of neutrinos from the Sun, the Earth, supernovae, and the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, providing complementary information to that obtained via other channels. The JUNO group at UC Irvine is involved in the construction, commissioning, data analysis, and leadership of JUNO. The group co-leads the installation and commissioning of the 25,600 3-inch “small” PMT system and the efforts to get it ready for physics. The group is also co-responsible for planning and deploying a calibration for the 20-inch PMT system’s instrumental non-linearity using the small PMT system, which will directly impact many of the results released by the experiment. The PI co-convenes the working group responsible for analyzing the rich reactor antineutrino dataset collected by JUNO and its satellite detector, TAO. The UC Irvine group actively participates in this work through the development of its own analysis framework and is preparing to play a leading role in the release of JUNO’s first physics results with reactor antineutrinos, some already expected to achieve world-leading precision. This cutting-edge research will train young scientists from diverse backgrounds and develop expertise in areas of strategic importance, such as nuclear physics, data science, and machine learning. Moreover, high school students and their teachers will engage through activities organized in partnership with the QuarkNet organization, including masterclasses, workshops, school visits, and research internships.

CAREER: QFT & beyond: new structures and tools for compressible phases,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award funds research and education into the study of novel materials, where strong interactions between particles give rise to unique and complex behaviors that challenge traditional understanding. Metals are a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science, with wide-ranging applications; their efficient conduction of electricity and heat arises from quantum mechanical laws that create a coordinated, collective motion among particles. However, current theories struggle to explain what happens when particles within these metals interact strongly. Such strongly interacting metals are known to exhibit certain remarkable properties, including high-temperature superconductivity. Yet, the diversity of these phases and their possible behaviors remains unexplored, largely due to a lack of suitable theoretical tools, placing them at the forefront of challenges in theoretical physics. This research will develop new theoretical tools to better understand and predict these unusual states of matter. By building on the latest advances in quantum field theory, it will provide new ways to explore how the structure of these materials affects their behavior. A key focus will be on understanding the unique patterns of correlation that can arise in metals, especially in strongly interacting phases. Some of these correlations involve quantum entanglement, a fundamental property that links particles in ways that classical physics cannot describe. Metals are among the most entangled states known, and understanding this entanglement is crucial, as it serves as a valuable resource for advancing quantum materials and quantum information science. This work will also shed light on fundamental quantum limits to how quickly these systems can reach thermal equilibrium, providing a deeper grasp of quantum mechanics. Ultimately, the insights gained may expand our understanding of the quantum world and open new avenues in the study of exotic phases of matter. The educational aspect of the project focuses on expanding access to education on modern quantum physics. Through the ""TeachQuantum"" program, high school teachers, especially from underserved communities in Chicago's South Side, will engage in quantum research experiences and bring these concepts to their classrooms, inspiring the next generation of scientists. Additionally, the project will revamp university-level courses to make quantum field theory more accessible to a broader audience. These efforts aim to cultivate a diverse and scientifically literate workforce. TECHNICAL SUMMARY The integration of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) into condensed matter physics has profoundly expanded our understanding of material phases and their underlying mechanisms. However, despite significant progress, critical challenges remain, particularly in the experimentally relevant context of compressible phases of matter, such as Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. The combination of extreme gaplessness and strong correlation makes the dynamics of non-Fermi liquids one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics, and constitutes a true frontier in QFT research. This research builds on recent developments in QFT to construct innovative approaches that can handle the extreme gaplessness of Fermi surfaces. It will exploit and refine generalized symmetries and their anomalies to identify the appropriate structure that underpins the nonlinear dynamics of Fermi liquids. It will also leverage recently discovered effective field theories (EFT) for Fermi liquids to establish controlled perturbative and non-perturbative approaches to non-Fermi liquids. One key objective is to understand protected geometric observables in Fermi liquids, and extend these insights to non-Fermi liquids. The proposed research will make use of UV/IR constraints to study these phases and their dynamics, with another goal being to prove the Planckian thermalization bound, a conjectured fundamental limit on how quickly systems can thermalize. It will furthermore investigate thermalization through the lens of quantum information and effective field theory, aiming to propose novel applications of quantum technologies. The educational aspect of the project focuses on expanding access to education on modern quantum physics. Through the ""TeachQuantum"" program, high school teachers, especially from underserved communities in Chicago's South Side, will engage in quantum research experiences and bring these concepts to their classrooms, inspiring the next generation of scientists.

Ponderomotive Optical Traps and Site-Selective Addressing for Rydberg-Atom Quantum Information Science,"Ensembles of Rydberg atoms in laser traps serve as platforms for quantum simulation and neutral-atom quantum computing. Rydberg-atom quantum simulators offer a configurable, controllable and scalable approach to model low-temperature and many-body quantum systems, which are of interest in science and technology across the disciplines, including physics, engineering, chemistry and nuclear physics. Such systems are often too complex to be modeled on a classical computer. By providing quantum modeling capability, Rydberg-atom quantum simulators/computers have the potential to drive societal change. Laser-trap arrays are a versatile platform to prepare and localize atoms in these devices. However, laser beams are subject to pointing and intensity noise. The resultant random forces acting on the atoms cause motional decoherence, which in turn reduces simulator performance. To address this problem, the present project deals with research on Rydberg-atom laser traps that minimize motional decoherence and allow for in-trap quantum simulation by uninterrupted pinning of the atoms at locations where the laser intensity is near-zero, and by ensuring that all atomic quantum states experience the same trapping potential. In this way, the detrimental effects of laser noise are minimized. The traps further enable site-selective quantum-state transitions in individual atoms at randomly accessed locations, as required in certain quantum simulations. The trapping methodology under investigation also promises progress in other fields of science, which include the measurement of atomic constants and the search for light axionic dark matter via microwave photon detection. The project further benefits society through education of graduate students, outreach to the public, and connections with industry. In the work, linear arrays of laser-cooled rubidium atoms are employed. The ponderomotive force that the trapping beams exert on the valence electron is used for both the trapping of the simulator atoms and for driving Rydberg-state transitions in them. The ac polarizability of Rb 5S1/2 and the Rydberg ponderomotive shift match at a “magic” wavelength of approximately 790.14 nm, which is accessed by narrow-band near-IR lasers. The laser traps are formed by a linear, hollow cylindrical beam for radial confinement and an array of transverse beams. The traps have identical potentials for ground- and Rydberg-levels. The magic character of the traps minimizes motional decoherence and allows in-trap quantum simulation over a substantial fraction of the Rydberg-atom lifetime. Ground- and Rydberg-state atoms are trapped at locations of minimal intensity, thus minimizing laser-noise-induced decoherence. The preparation of defect-free atom arrays follows, in part, established protocols. Photoionization only plays a minor role. Transitions between Rydberg states are driven by microwave-modulated ponderomotive tweezer beams that are directed at selected trapping sites. The dynamic variables of the in-trap simulator include Rabi frequency, detuning, phase, and interaction strength. Interactions across trapping sites are afforded by strong dipolar couplings between nS1/2 and n’P1/2 states, which are conducive to fast simulators with interactions that can reach over several sites. Readout methods involve Rydberg-atom ionization and state-selective fluorescence imaging. Optical Rydberg-atom circularization methods will be tested towards future applications, which may take advantage of long circular-state lifetimes and coherence times. The effort overall will lay foundations for ponderomotive Rydberg-atom quantum simulation and processing.

Puzzling Out the Proton with Precision Scattering Experiments,"Protons are one of the basic building blocks of all matter around us. Even 100 years after their discovery, they are still not fully understood. In fact, even the size of the proton has been a puzzle for over a decade now, after an extremely precise measurement in 2010 found a value much smaller than and in strong disagreement with previous determinations. The research supported by this grant aims to resolve this “Proton Radius puzzle”, which has found widespread interest beyond the physics community. The award supports the PI’s activity in the Muon Proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE) at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, which will provide crucial data to resolve the puzzle, and to determine the shape of the proton. The experiment will check if electrons and their heavier cousins, muons, interact in the same way, and will test our understanding of the scattering process by comparing electron and positron scattering. The work of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers is central to these efforts, and they will gain knowledge and experience in precise nuclear physics experiments, modern detector and accelerator techniques, as well as in simulation and analysis algorithms. This international research project will expose them to researchers from all over the world, fostering cultural exchange and giving them the opportunity to develop their communication and leadership skills. The award further supports the group’s involvement in various outreach programs with a focus on high-schools and underrepresented groups. MUSE will make use of the worldwide unique beam available at the Paul Scherrer Institute to measure the lepton-proton cross section. It is the first measurement of muon-proton scattering that is precise enough to address the 4% effect at the heart of the proton radius puzzle. Through the measurement of muons of both charges, as well as electrons and positrons over a wide kinematic range, MUSE will provide crucial data to verify the existing e-p scattering results, test radiative corrections including two-photon-exchange by comparison of the two charges, and search for a violation of lepton universality by comparison of the two lepton families. Dr. Bernauer’s group will play a crucial role in the development of the software and the analysis of the data and support the data taking efforts with shift work.

Superfluid 3He Surface bound excitations and A-B interface dynamics,"Non-Technical Abstract The devices we use every day have enriched our lives immeasurably and are often cheaper and faster than the best available a generation ago. Many of these advances have relied on progress in condensed matter research that has ultimately contributed to the economic well-being of the Nation. This project will demonstrate a significant advance in the measurement of frequency – actualizing a precise clock, with an accuracy approaching that of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The research aims to identify exotic material behaviors or exotic magnetic behaviors that could, in the future, could form the basis of new types of devices for metrology and computation. The research team will accomplish this by designing and fabricating structures that will access new areas of quantum nano-fluidics and enable precision measurements on helium films down a few atoms thick. These films will be contained in specially fabricated silicon nanostructures, under conditions where new phases should emerge that have exotic behaviors such as chirality (where the fluid exhibits a handedness like the spin of a top), or exotic magnetic behaviors, quantized flow or highly conducting “edge states”. The conversion from one state to another (“phase transition”) should reveal whether models of the early universe (important for our understanding of the evolution of the universe) can be tested in the laboratory. Our past graduate students and undergraduates have gone on to productive careers in academia, high-technology industries and the financial sector, and the planned research will prepare a new generation of students for challenging careers. Throughout their tenure, our graduate and undergraduate students will present their findings to both technically advanced and lay audiences to encourage broader participation of junior and high school students in the STEM fields. Technical Abstract Superfluid 3He can inform research activity that extends across many fields in Physics. The project combines nanofluidics (examining fluid behavior confined within silicon cavities with sizes tuned to the scale of the superfluid’s coherence length), high-precision low-noise thermometry with low temperature physics, to expose new size effects. It will require the development of new measurement protocols to utilize low noise capabilities of SQUIDs and enable high precision measurement of frequency (and thus assay mass of ultra-thin films). The experimental activity will probe excitations in these thin films or bound near surfaces using transport (superfluid density and heat conductivity). It is predicted that entirely new superfluid states can be stabilized by such confinement. Confinement and new high precision techniques will also provide the means to study the surface/edge excitations. Furthermore, this research activity will provide a new example of ""cosmology in the laboratory"" where a transition from one superfluid state to another under confinement should proceed only by “intrinsic mechanisms”. The occurrence of such transitions will potentially provide a model of processes during the inflationary epoch of the early universe. New geometries will explore the physics of quantum transport across single and multiple interfaces. Eventually, the new superfluids that emerge under confinement might be of interest in quantum computation. By combining low temperatures, nano fabrication, and high precision measurements, graduate students and undergraduates will be exposed to the exciting training ground that has prepared scientists for leading roles in academia and high-technology industries. Personnel will also work to hone communication skills and enable diverse participation into the STEM fields.

FLF renewal,"Heat engines form one of the cornerstones of classical thermodynamics. By converting heat into mechanical work they powered the industrial revolution in the 19th century. Molecular heat engines have the potential to convert thermal energy to electrical power and vice versa with efficiency close to the thermodynamic limit. The topic of single-molecule thermoelectricity is therefore of fundamental importance for the development of on-chip cooling and heat-to-electricity energy harvesting technologies that could power the quantum revolution of the 21st century. The key challenge in harnessing the thermoelectric energy conversion capabilities of single molecules is gaining a better understanding of the quantum mechanical interactions between molecular electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, which could prove transformative for experiments in the research area of open quantum systems. These experiments will deliver impact in two ways: by exploring new science and by laying the foundation for new technologies.

New science: Molecular heat engines form an ideal platform for exploring the dialogue between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. While some theoretical efforts have been undertaken towards this end, many predictions remain to be verified by experiments. New insights into thermodynamics on the molecular scale will also raise further questions: Does quantum coherence boost the thermoelectric efficiency of single-molecule heat engines? What happens if the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down? Can molecular vibrational modes be electrically cooled to their ground state?

New technologies: Thermoelectrics have a long history of providing simple, reliable power generation. Yet, the use of thermoelectric materials to recover waste heat has remained limited due to their scarcity and toxicity, and the unfortunate fact that the properties that determine their efficiency - the electrical conductance, the thermal conductance, and the Seebeck coefficient - are contra-indicated, meaning that an improvement to one will deteriorate another. Quantum effects in single-molecule heat engines lift the link between these contra-indicated properties, thereby opening up the possibility for highly efficient thermoelectric generators that could provide a low-cost, environmentally-friendly means of scavenging waste heat that would drastically decrease global energy consumption.

This proposal seeks to develop the instrumentation and experimental methodology to investigate controlled thermoelectric heat-to-energy conversion in a single molecule, where the emphasis is on controlling the molecular interactions. This control will be achieved by using two-dimensional networks of nanoparticles linked via molecular junctions. Building on recent ground-breaking experiments, I will use electric-field control to tune the molecular energy level alignment with respect of the Fermi level of the substrate, while simultaneously controlling the tunnel coupling and applied bias voltage. A local heater will drive a thermally generated flow of electrons through a single molecule, which I will be able to optimize thanks to the unprecedented degree of tunability in the system. By probing the thermoelectric efficiency over a wide parameter space, I will establish the intrinsic thermodynamic limits to single-molecule energy conversion.",749874,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Understanding neutrino oscillations and interactions with off-axis neutrino beams,"Explaining the observed excess of matter compared to antimatter in the early universe is one of the biggest questions in physics. Neutrino oscillations can violate the CP symmetry, potentially by an amount large enough to produce this excess. Understanding neutrino oscillations is an essential step to understanding the universe we see today.

Hyper-Kamiokande will use a 200-kiloton water Cherenkov detector to measure neutrino oscillations with unprecedented statistical precision. The challenge is to reduce the systematic uncertainties of Hyper-Kamiokande to ensure the success of its oscillation measurements. Addressing this challenge has been the focus of my fellowship to date and is the continued focus of this renewal.

The dominant systematics in long-baseline oscillation experiments are due to the difficulty in relating what is observed in the detector to the neutrino energy. The IWCD experiment has been designed to measure neutrino interactions over a range of angles off the J-PARC neutrino beam axis. The peak energy of the neutrino beam decreases as the off-axis angle increases, allowing IWCD to directly relate neutrino energy to what is seen in the detector. This link enables IWCD to produce a data-driven mapping between neutrino energy and the signatures observed in the detector, significantly reducing the systematic uncertainty associated with this.

The IWCD method requires a detailed understanding of the water Cherenkov detector, in particular the detector fiducial volume. In the first fouyr years of this fellowship I have designed, produced and characterised a novel optical calibration system that is currently being deployed at the WCTE experiment at CERN. The data from this calibration system and WCTE will demonstrate the ability to achieve percent-level uncertainties in neutrino event reconstruction using a water Cherenkov detector. WCTE will also provide new measurements of lepton scattering on oxygen, a crucial input to producing more the accurate neutrino interaction models required for Hyper-Kamiokande.

This fellowship originally proposed to address the key challenges in neutrino oscillation physics in two new ways: development of a novel calibration system to understand water Cherenkov detectors and the use of off-axis beams to understand neutrino interactions. I have accomplished the first of these goals during the initial four years of the fellowship and this renewal will allow me to accomplish the second. Together these will produce the world's most sensitive search for CP violation in neutrino oscillations.",749637,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Exascale Exoplanet Modelling,"Answers to two of the most important questions facing humankind - Does life exist beyond Earth? and How will Earth's climate change in the future? - are potentially within our reach. These two questions are intricately linked by the requirement of a detailed theoretical understanding of how planetary environments evolve as complete systems, including life itself, and cannot be answered with observations alone.

Huge investment in observational facilities targeting planets discovered beyond our solar system, or exoplanets, is being made with even higher levels planned in the coming decade. This opportunity is concurrent with the realisation that existing numerical climate models are not sufficient to provide the accuracy of predictions required to adapt to, or mitigate for, climate change. This realisation has motivated the Met Office to invest in the development of a completely new, state-of-the-art computational framework (termed LFRic) capable of overcoming current barriers in accurately predicting our own climate. Similarly, solving puzzles hampering our progress in understanding exoplanets also requires a step-change in model performance, particularly in light of the imminent advancement of observational facilities (e.g., James Webb Space Telescope, 2021; Extremely Large Telescope, 2025; Terra Hunting Experiment). My research sits at the confluence of these factors, boosted by investment in a new building housing both the Astrophysics group and the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter.

Using this UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship I will deliver a research programme focused on co-developing the next generation of climate modelling software, launched from a foundation of a strong, and unique, existing knowledge transfer connection with the Met Office, and exploiting the combination of the described large-scale investments. The research programme will be coupled with a coherent programme of innovative engagement activities/resources (e.g., https://tinyurl.com/y48tewug), linking with partners to enhance interaction with research and further study, and enhance pedagogical practices themselves. The unique flexibility, focus and freedom afforded by a Future Leaders Fellowship will allow me, with the group formed as part of the programme, to create a hub of excellence leading exoplanet research intricately linked to efforts to predict our own changing climate.

The breadth of the programme, addressing outstanding issues for both gas giant and terrestrial or Earth-like exoplanets, alongside the unique real-time connection, via software development and exchange of people, between exoplanet and Earth-system science, partnered with the wider impact and engagement programme will make this UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship a unique endeavour. The primary objectives are to adapt and co-develop LFRic, adding capabilities beyond the model's Earth focus, to address key areas of exoplanet research: why irradiated gas giant exoplanets have much larger radii than models predict, combining detailed models of the chemistry (including condensates/clouds and photochemistry), dynamics and radiative transfer (or heating) to interpret the currently confounding observations of exoplanets across the mass range, and finally quantify the impact of processes such as stellar flares, clouds and convection, as well as simple biogeochemical cycles, on the possibility and signposts of life on other planets. The shared development and knowledge exchange will enable progress to also benefit efforts to better predict Earth's climate as it moves beyond the current regime.

Crucially, the developments will be performed following an open-source approach, allowing a wide group of beneficiaries both within Earth system and exoplanet science to benefit. The link of the research with engagement will also benefit students both in the south west and nationally, business partners and teachers and improve the wider perception of UKRI programmes.",749609,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Planetary Original Diagnostics at Extreme Conditions with Raman Spectroscopy,"Jupiter is a planet comprised of more than 87% H2 and He. The deep interior of Jupiter has extremely high temperatures (Ts) and pressures (Ps). Additionally, Uranus and Neptune are known as the ""ice giants"", because their mantle holds large amounts of H2O, NH3 and CH4. These planets have dynamos which generate magnetic fields. In Jupiter, the dynamo can be explained by the immiscibility of H2 and He under conditions where H2 becomes a metallic fluid, while in Uranus and Neptune, the conduction results from the movement of free H2 ions, liberated through the disintegration of molecules into a state known as superionic H2O. These phenomena are caused by the immense P and T in the core of the planets. High P leads to extraordinary changes in the properties of matter: under high P, metals can become insulators, H2O transforms into H3O and H2 gas transitions into a metallic and even superconducting state. Quantum chemistry has revealed that our understanding of planetary materials cannot depend solely on observations made under Earth's conditions. Thus, it is crucial to measure the fundamental chemical changes under extreme conditions.

Standard models in the astrophysical literature often use extremely simplistic descriptions of condensed matter, typically relying on linear extrapolations from ambient conditions. This approach is understandable in the absence of data, but with the experimental data provided by this project, these models will require a more sophisticated treatment. Communication via open literature can be inefficient; so we are participating in conferences, meetings and establishing collaborations with members of planetary research groups to ensure that our findings are adopted by the astrophysics community.

In this project, we have non-destructively created the conditions of these planetary outer layers in our laboratory. We use the diamond anvil cell (DAC), a device capable of generating P exceeding 1,000,000 atm by compressing a tiny sample between two diamonds, combined with resistive heating or pulsed laser to raise the sample T to thousands of Kelvin. The DAC is a portable device, which allows to exploit many different probes appropriate for the study of metallic and superionic hot fluids. 

The aim of this research is to provide a window into the world of planetary interiors, addressing questions such as:

-Are H2 and He immiscible above the metallic H2 transition temperature?
-Are the magnetic properties of Uranus and Neptune exclusively due to superionic H2O?
-Do CH4, H2O and NH3 decompose and react to form superionic compounds?
-Can H2 diffuse into and/or react with the ice layers of the giant planets?

To achieve these goals, we are studying planetary-relevant systems in the DAC at high T, individually and in mixtures. These systems include H2, H2-He mixtures, H2O, NH3, H2O-NH3 mixtures, CH4 and CH4/H2O/NH3 mixtures (H2-H2O, H2-NH3 and H2-CH4). Our experimental setup incorporates resistive, and laser (CO2 or IR) heating methods coupled with the DAC and the dynamic-DAC (d-DAC), which allows compression rates between those of classical static and laser-driven shock compression. 

A significant innovation is the implementation of the novel d-DAC coupled with resistive heating, which helps to overcome the time scales of sample diffusion out of the chamber. We have integrated IR pulse laser heating and d-DAC with time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. We have also performed transport measurements at P up to 200 GPa to investigate how P and T affect the conductivity of planetary ices and the resistance changes in fluid metallic H2. These experiments are extremely challenging and come with a very steep learning curve. To maximise their potential, we are implementing transport measurements to characterise materials synthesised at lower pressures in solid state that are candidates for superconductivity.",748774,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Space Sciences
Terahertz-frequency sensors for atmospheric chemistry and space research (renewal),"When we look into space with existing infrared, radio and microwave sensors, we see less than half the light in our galaxy. Most of this ""missing"" light lies in the terahertz (THz) or far-infrared part of the spectrum (1-10 THz, 30-300 micron wavelength). Indeed, the ""invisible"" gases in the Earth's atmosphere and the ""dark"" dust and gas clouds between stars all glow with distinctive THz fingerprints, providing a wealth of hidden information urgently needed by atmospheric and space scientists.

Despite this great potential, existing THz sensor systems are too large, fragile and complex for most applications outside the laboratory and lack the sensitivity needed for studying reactive gases. Furthermore, this lack of technological readiness limits the prospects for THz systems being deployed in space. A short time-window is available for the UK to invest in real-world demonstrations of key THz components and sensing techniques and secure a place in forthcoming space missions, for example, via the ESA Earth Explorer 12 (or 13) programmes. Without this, the potential for a UK researcher to lead the world in this emerging area will be lost.

In this fellowship, I am overcoming limitations of THz gas sensors by developing high-sensitivity systems based on quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) - highly compact sources of THz radiation, which yield >1000 times the power of any similar-sized device. I have developed new project partnerships to exploit extremely fast and stable TeraFET detectors, enabling tiny changes in gas concentrations to be measured in real time. Unlike previous THz-QCL-based gas-sensing schemes, I am developing high-precision analytical chemistry techniques, and have developed the first custom-made multi-pass gas cell in which THz radiation passes repeatedly through the gas under study, yielding an estimated 100x improvement in sensitivity.

In this Renewal phase of the fellowship, I will adapt my internationally-leading THz gas sensing instrumentation to use an ultraviolet (UV) laser to simulate the behaviour of gases in the upper atmosphere, and ""trigger"" chemical reactions at a precise time. This will allow me to study the behaviour of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde as they react in the atmosphere, and resolve the huge uncertainties in the effect of these reactions on climate change. By developing fast detection schemes, I will provide the means to study the concentrations of industrial and agricultural pollutants in real time, and I will investigate the potential for UV-pump/THz-probe ""step-scan"" detection technique to probe the dynamics of upper-atmospheric reactions on microsecond timescales.

Through my partnership with RAL Space, I have demonstrated the world's first integration of THz QCLs with precision-micromachined waveguides, antennas, and ""on-chip"" stabilisation subsystems. This Renewal phase will provide a further step-change in capability, by developing the first satellite-compatible THz laser stabilisation schemes, through the use of integrated power and frequency control systems, within ""sugarcube""-sized satellite-compatible modules. I will work with RAL Space, and TK Instruments to demonstrate this capability within a space-qualified cryocooler, including bespoke THz optics and calibration targets, on a satellite-test ""breadboard"", underpinning its future deployment on a satellite platform.

To sustain my research vision, and establish THz sensing as a key tool for atmospheric and space research, I will work closely with my project partners to secure follow-on funding for THz chemistry, Earth observation and critical satellite payload instrumentation. I will produce a roadmap for in-orbit deployment, and commercialisation, including developing the science and technology case for a European Space Agency satellite mission through the Earth Explorer programme.",748514,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Forest Formulas for the LHC,"One of the greatest scientific events of the century is the discovery of the Higgs boson by CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Yet the LHCs discovery potential has by no means been exhausted as collisions are now happening with an increasing rate at energies never achieved before by mankind. With more and more data being accumulated over the next 15 years we will obtain measurements at unprecedented levels of precision. This data will put stringent new tests on the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. While the success of the SM is the greatest achievement of particle physics to date, it also poses many mysteries to physicists. For instance, the SM does not explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry, or the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. To overcome these problems new models, featuring as exotic ideas as supersymmetry or extra dimensions, have been proposed. So far none of these models could be detected in experiments, but beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics may still be detected at the energy currently explored by the LHC.
To distinguish new physics from the SM, theoretical calculations must match the accuracy of the experimental measurements. This poses a tremendous challenge since it is impossible to calculate general observables exactly in quantum field theory. Instead, theoretical physicists resort to what is called the perturbative expansion; this is a systematic way to expand the complicated functions, which describe the scattering rates, in a series in the interaction strength, where each successive term is smaller than the preceding. By calculating enough terms in this expansion one can thus obtain increasingly reliable results. Especially in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the dynamics of the constituent quarks and gluons of the proton, the convergence of this expansion is relatively slow and in certain cases computations with three or four terms are required. The problem with this approach is that the Feynman diagrams, which appear in the individual terms of this expansion, rapidly increase in both number and complexity. To make matters worse, these Feynman diagrams also contain complicated infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences (singularities) which are of long- and short-distance origin.
While the problem of UV divergences has been solved already half a century ago by the procedure of renormalisation, the situation is very different for the IR divergences. Calculating higher-order effects in QCD requires the combination of two separate contributions: real corrections (due to emissions of observable particles) and virtual (loop or quantum) corrections. While it is well known that the divergences of the real emission corrections cancel with those of the virtual corrections, the cancellations only happen after all the different loop and phase-space integrals have been performed.
A rigorous approach to renormalisation is given by the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann (BPHZ) scheme also known as the ""forest formula"", where the term forest refers to sets of nested or disjoint divergent subgraphs. The key idea of this project is to develop and use ""generalised forest formulas"" for the subtraction of IR divergences. While this proposition is far from trivial, recent breakthroughs which I have made in my recent research have already proven the concept, obtaining a plethora of new results which could not have been achieved by other means. The future potential of this approach is great, as it opens the door for new ways of calculating quantities, which are desperately needed to improve the precision of current theory predictions, such as the 4-loop splitting functions, which govern the energy dependence of partons in the proton, and the 2-loop anomalous dimensions which govern the energy dependence of coupling parameters in the SM EFT, a general model-independent framework to BSM physics.",747819,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Radiation-hard digital analog silicon photomultipliers for future upgrades of Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors,"Two of the leading experiments in the field of experimental particle physics are the LHCb spectrometer, which detects particles produced by high-energy collisions at the LHC accelerator, and the Belle II spectrometer, which operates at the SuperKEKB accelerator. Of key importance to both experiments is the precise identification of the resulting particles, for which Ring Cherenkov (RICH) detectors are used. Accelerator upgrades planned over the course of this decade will greatly increase the luminosity, and thus both the rate of detection of true events and the level of ionizing radiation to which the detectors will be exposed. Therefore, it will also be necessary to upgrade some subdetector systems of the spectrometers.Such upgrades of the RICH detectors will require photodetectors that will be able to efficiently detect single photons with high spatial and timing resolution, and retain such abilities over several years of operation despite exposure to high levels of radiation. The combination of all these requirements is not met by any of the currently available photodetectors, so dedicated technology development is required. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a relatively new light sensor, with excellent performance but insufficient tolerance to radiation. In this project, we propose the development of SiPMs that will meet all of the requirements of next-generation RICH detectors, including radiation hardness. This will be achieved by developing and integrating dedicated electronics, and combining several radiation hard techniques in the design of SiPMs.",745458,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Individualising Radiotherapy Through Mechanistic Models,"Radiotherapy treats cancer through the precise delivery of high doses of radiation to tumours, killing cancerous cells by damaging their DNA. Radiotherapy is highly effective because radiation can be accurately targeted to tumours while avoiding normal tissue, preventing the unwanted side effects which would result from killing healthy cells. The introduction of new advanced treatment techniques and better imaging to improve tumour targeting has significantly improved patient outcomes following radiotherapy. However, while radiotherapy benefits from a high degree of physical personalisation, more can be done to improve treatment outcomes. 

Cancer is a highly complex disease, associated with a large number of different types of genetic mutation. These mutations can significantly affect the radiation sensitivity of a given patient's cancer. Despite this, all patients with cancer in a particular organ are typically treated with the same dose and treatment schedule. While these doses have been tailored to cancer at a population level, this almost certainly under- and over-treats some patients. If individual radiosensitivity can be precisely defined before treatment, significant improvements in outcome could be achieved, in terms of improved tumour control or reduced side effects, depending on the patient's particular genetics. 

This fellowship seeks to address this challenge by developing models of how cells respond to radiation, which can accurately predict the sensitivity of an individual's disease based on the mutations present in their particular cancer. In work to date, we have developed models and characterised responses related to DNA repair, and shown that we can effectively predict and quantify quantify how DNA repair failure impacts on radiosensitivity. 

However, this work has also shown that although loss of DNA repair is important, it only explains a small fraction of the variability between the responses of different cancers and different patients. As a result, this approach needs to be expanded to better understand the range of responses seen in the clinic.

In this renewal phase, we will work to better characterise these differences, measuring the impact that changes in other biological processes - such as those related to cell growth and cell death - have on radiation sensitivity, and integrate this into a combined model. We will demonstrate the efficacy of this model using new data generated locally, and then develop a method by which these predictions can be applied in clinical treatment plans, to enable its predictions to be tested in real patient data.

If successful, this research programme will deliver a unique tool to enable the tailoring of radiotherapy using both physical and biological factors, offering more personalised therapy and better treatment outcomes for patients suffering from cancer in the future.",745339,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Exploitation of High Voltage CMOS sensors for tracking applications in physics experiments and beyond,"Silicon tracking detectors sit at the core of many particle and nuclear physics experiments to measure the trajectory of charged particles produced in collisions or decay processes. The specifications for these detectors are many and often extremely challenging, as they need to track with the highest possible accuracy the many billions of charged particles that are produced every second in an experiment. The state-of-the-art in silicon tracking detectors for the current generation of physics experiments consists of hybrid sensors in planar processes (combined with a separate readout chip) and monolithic sensors in industry-standard CMOS processes. While both approaches are successfully deployed in current experiments, such as the ATLAS and ALICE experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, they are not able to meet all the requirements of future experiments in a single device. Monolithic silicon sensors in industry-standard High Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) processes, a variant of CMOS, are the strongest candidate to meet all the specifications for the next generation of physics experiments. HV-CMOS sensors integrate the sensing cell (i.e. the pixel) and the readout chip in a single device (i.e. a sensor chip) that can be as thin as 50 micrometers. HV-CMOS sensors provide good spatial resolution, fast time resolution, excellent radiation tolerance, all at very competitive cost per area. They were first proposed in 2007 and have matured significantly since then. Upcoming experiments that have selected or propose HV-CMOS for their silicon tracking detector, such as the Mu3e experiment at PSI in Switzerland and the Mighty Tracker upgrade for the LHCb experiment at CERN, will showcase its use for large tracking systems for the future.

In this research, I propose to deploy the highly-performant HV-CMOS sensor chips I have developed already in the first phase of my research programme in two physics experiments that will lead to the discovery of exciting new physics. I will target the proton Electric Dipole Moment (pEDM) search proposed by the JEDI collaboration at the COSY synchrotron in Germany initially, followed by the LHCb VELO detector upgrade at the High Luminosity LHC at CERN. Using my highly-performant HV-CMOS sensor chips, I will assemble technology demonstrators and evaluate them in the Liverpool clean rooms and international facilities to demonstrate they meet the specifications required by these experiments. I will seek the commercialisation of my highly radiation tolerant UKRI-MPW sensor technology for commercial applications beyond physics. To benefit the wider society, I will target applications in particle beam therapy, electron microscopy, nuclear facility monitoring and space. I will also deliver large area highly-performant HV-CMOS sensors that will incorporate all the lessons learned during the first phase of my research programme.",741798,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Information and Computing Sciences; Data Management and Data Science; Nuclear and Plasma Physics"
BSM-PM: Precision Measurements of Weak-Force Induced Parity Violating Transitions in Atomic Cesium,"The Standard Model of particle physics is the most successful physical model describing the structure of the known matter of the universe and the interactions between these particles. Still, we know that the Standard Model is not complete, in that there are several features of the universe that it cannot explain. These include the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter, the identity of dark matter and dark energy, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. A variety of theoretical models that extend the Standard Model, so-called beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics, have been proposed. Precision atomic, molecular, and optical physics measurements can be used to test the predictions of the Standard Model in small scale, table-top experiments, validating the standard model in this energy range, or helping elevate one of the various proposals for BSM physics. The goal of the proposed work is to precisely measure the strength of an extremely weak optical interaction in atomic cesium. This interaction is permitted only through the influence of the weak force interaction between electrons and the cesium nucleus, or between the nucleons themselves. A precision measurement of the strength of this interaction provides a precise value of the weak charge of the cesium nucleus, which in turn is used to determine a quantity known as the electro-weak mixing angle. The goal of the present program is to improve the precision of the value of the electro-weak mixing angle in the low energy range, testing the level of agreement with the Standard Model prediction, and possibly discriminating between various BSM models. In addition to its impact on our understanding of the universe, this program provides a valuable laboratory experience for graduate and undergraduate students. Students gain strength in physics knowledge and technical skills in lasers and optics, vacuum techniques, electronics, data acquisition and analysis, and technical writing, which they can apply to solving other important technical problems in industry or academics. One set of measurements proposed in this program will be carried out on the optical transition from the ground 6S state to the excited 7S state in atomic cesium. The weak force interaction, which is not symmetric upon spatial inversion, slightly mixes atomic states of opposite parity (S- and P-states, for example), and introduces a weak electric dipole (E1) transition moment between the 6S ground state and 7S excited state. Using a two-pathway coherent control technique, and applying a uniform static electric field to the atoms, the investigators will drive the transition concurrently with two optical interactions, one a linear interaction with 539.5 nm light (the weak-force allowed transition and a Stark-induced transition); the second a two-photon interaction with light at 852 nm and 1470 nm. The laser beams are phase locked to one another, assuring mutual coherence between the optical interactions. The interference between the strong two-photon interaction and the weak linear interactions can be controlled by varying the optical phase difference between the various laser beams, resulting in modulation of the total excitation rate. Precise measurement of the amplitude of the modulation allows a precise determination of the ratio of the E1 moment for the transition and the Stark transition polarizability. The goal of the measurement is to reduce the uncertainty of this ratio to a value approaching 0.1%. A second measurement is based on the extremely weak E1 transition between hyperfine components of the ground state. The largest contribution to this nuclear-spin-dependent interaction is due to the anapole moment of the nucleus, which results from a parity-odd nuclear current produced by the weak force interaction between nucleons.

CAREER: Energetic Electron Trapping and Acceleration in Magnetized Plasma with Magnetic Islands and Field Stochasticity,"This award supports a study of energetic electron acceleration and transport in magnetized plasmas in geospace and in a laboratory. Solar flares directed toward the Earth are known to cause massive radio outages, interference with GPS systems and aircraft communication, damage to spacecraft and to threaten astronauts’ safety. It has been shown that up to 50% of the energy released during solar flares can be carried by energetic electrons (EEs). However, the mechanisms for the observed electron acceleration and transport remain unclear. This project will investigate how EEs get trapped, accelerated and de-trapped in magnetized plasmas with magnetic islands and stochastic fields both in space and in laboratory experiments. The scientific goals of the project will draw together the fields of space physics, solar physics, and plasma physics, while also connecting to the development of models for space weather prediction and fusion energy reactor disruption mitigation. In addition, the project aims to establish the first plasma-focused professional development certification program in the state of Alabama, called “Gateway to Plasma”. The curriculum development includes writing an Introduction to Plasma textbook appropriate for students with little or no background in physics and mathematics. The content of the online lessons will be focused on plasma basics and teaching industry-relevant skills. Observations suggest that energetic electrons can be trapped and accelerated in regions of the Earth’s magnetosphere where the magnetic field forms islands, or twisted magnetic flux tubes. It is hypothesized that when such islands merge or break apart, the EEs are de-confined through the formation of chaotic and random, or stochastic, magnetic fields. This project will investigate the following specific questions: (i) What is the characteristic scale of islands needed to trap EEs? (ii) Can island contraction and expansion lead to diffusion regime switch? (iii) How do stochastic fields affect electron diffusion? (iv) How do changes in the disorder regime affect electron diffusion? (v) Which processes are universal and scalable from lab to space? These questions will be studied using a spectral approach where probability for transport in a given magnetic field topology is calculated from the energy spectrum of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator. The spectral model will be informed from and validated against laboratory experiments, spacecraft measurements, and tracer particle simulations. This work is expected to advance knowledge relevant to space weather forecasting, as well as the operation and safety of future fusion energy reactors. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.

DARK MAtter for Precision experiments (DARKMAP) Renewal,"Our best understanding of the inner working of the Universe demands that Dark Matter contributes about 80% of the total mass of the Universe, shaping its form at all astronomical scales. 
However, the composition of Dark Matter in terms of fundamental particles remains a puzzle
and all attempts to solve it through measurements or direct observation have failed to date.
Established experiments have focussed on searches for Dark Matter that scatters off heavy atoms in deep underground labs, assuming it behaves like slowly moving particles. This type of Dark Matter is called Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) and its mass is a multiple of the proton mass. 
For Dark Matter masses below the mass of a Carbon atom the momentum of the slowly moving WIMPs drops below the recoil threshold of the heavy nuclei used in these experiments and it cannot be detected anymore. 
If Dark Matter is much lighter, its properties are fundamentally different, and it would be better described as a homogeneous fluid-like substance instead of a cloud of massive particle. Experiments searching for elastic scattering are entirely insensitive in this case. This very light Dark Matter behaves more like a new force acting very weakly on electrons and nuclei or affecting their spin. In this case the expected effects are tiny and can only be observed in extremely precise measurements of fundamental constants and interactions.

This project is a truly multidisciplinary effort to enable the search for dark matter with high-precision atomic physics experiments. Many of these experiments have made enormous progress during the last decades, increasing their sensitivity by many orders of magnitude. These high-precision experiments can potentially measure the very minute effects exerted by interactions of light and very light dark matter. The theoretical mechanism underlying the production of this type of dark matter in the universe helps, because it predicts resonantly enhanced time-dependent signals, if the experiment can be designed to pick it up. Depending on the specific interaction, one dedicated or a variety of experiments might be the right strategy.
In order to answer this question a consistent theoretical framework will be developed taking into account the complex structure of quantum field theories necessary to describe dark matter at high energies. Even though high-precision experiments are performed at rather low energies compared to collider experiments or even some astrophysical processes these calculations are necessary to correctly derive observables and correlations between observables for these experiments. This framework further makes the different experimental approaches comparable and existing limits can be used to optimise future experiments. With this in hand we can collaborate with atomic physicists throughout the UK to design an experimental programme exploiting the untapped potential of high-precision experiments to search for and potentially discover dark matter.",740622,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
CAREER: Engineering topological order in tunable artificial ruthenate heterostructures,"Non-Technical Abstract: Topological phases in condensed matter systems have emerged as a fascinating new paradigm in the past few decades. Such phases are of great interest due to their fantastic potential for numerous quantum information science applications, including as building blocks of quantum computers. Complex oxide materials have been predicted to host such phases, in some cases at elevated temperatures suitable for broad practical use. In this project, the research team aims to develop the synthesis and characterization of such materials using several approaches to maximize the probability for discovery of unique topological phases. Success of this research will establish a new class of topological materials and determine their potential for applications. This project also addresses the current need for increased educational activity for both topological physics and materials science. For the former, the principal investigator is developing two new courses focused on topological physics for both undergraduate and graduate students. For the latter, an annual week-long summer camp for middle-school students is being held in the research laboratory. Technical Abstract: Complex oxides host a variety of fascinating properties with many possible applications in quantum information science. Unfortunately, many of these efforts are stymied by the difficulty of the required synthesis and characterization techniques. In particular, strontium ruthenate has received heavy scrutiny in recent decades due to its unconventional superconductivity and ferromagnetic instability. The controversial superconductivity was until very recently believed to be odd parity with potential for hosting Majorana fermions. Furthermore, theoretical calculations also predict topological phases in ruthenates when confined along atypical crystallographic orientations. In this project, the research team is investigating both behaviors by synthesis and band structure characterization of geometrically engineered ruthenate heterostructures. Innovative pulsed laser deposition techniques are adapted to stabilize the materials in the required orientations despite the polarity mismatch between layers. Surface preservation and cleaning procedures in combination with state-of-the-art characterization techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy are implemented to study these materials. Realization of topological phases in geometrically engineered oxides would provide key insight into their properties and facilitate their utilization in quantum information devices.

CAREER: Fundamental phenomena in magnon condensates,"Non-technical abstract: Bosons are particles of integer spin that allow for the fundamental quantum effect of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC), which manifests as the spontaneous formation of a macroscopic coherent quantum state in an otherwise incoherent multi-particle system. The project will improve understanding of the BEC phenomenon in magnetic quasiparticles – magnons. This work may have a transformative effect on the fields of quantum information science, solid-state physics, and modern magnetism, as well as help maintain US leadership in the area of quantum information science and technology. This CAREER project explores ferromagnetic structures to understand magnon BEC properties and interactions with a dense magnon gas existing alongside it using state-of-the-art nanofabrication, optical, and microwave characterization techniques. The educational component of the project integrates contemporary research themes into existing graduate and undergraduate courses, creates new quantum physics and quantum information science lab courses, provides access to scientific developments to a broad community, and increases the number of students in STEM through the organization of scientific tournaments. Technical abstract: Despite many achievements in the field of magnon gases and condensates, like the observation of magnon supercurrents, Bogoliubov waves, Josephson effect, and second sound, there are many intriguing fundamental questions still open. One of them is how these phenomena are affected by boundaries or geometrical confinement, and what are the critical sizes of the system to support magnon BEC in ferromagnetic materials. The project combines state-of-the-art micro- and nano-structuring with optical Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and introduces optical heating techniques at room as well as cryogenic temperatures. The project's aims are: (i) Experimentally observe and compare magnon BEC dynamics in conventional 3D, quasi-2D, and quasi-1D structures; (ii) Create a persistent condensed phase and determine its areas of existence; (ii) Study properties of magnon BEC in systems with periodic boundary conditions (rings); (iii) Create a complete joint model of magnon second sound and Bogoliubov waves in continuous and confined samples; (iv) Experimental observe and study magnon thermodynamic lasing effect.

CAREER: Chiral Phenomena of Excited States in Spintronics,"Nontechnical Abstract: Chirality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, ranging from elementary particles to chemistry and biomolecules. Most studied chiral phenomena rely on a static view of chirality, that is, whether an object can be superimposed on its mirror image. In fact, the concept of chirality can be extended to moving objects: rattleback, for example, is a spinning top that only rotates in a preferred direction. In condensed matter systems, dynamic chirality can lead to a variety of interesting phenomena and applications. Here, the research team focuses on the chiral interactions between structural, electronic, magnetic dynamics in atomically thin van der Waals materials. The research project brings together advanced spectroscopy and modeling techniques to investigate the optical and transport properties emerged from chiral interactions. These properties hold the promise of producing circularly polarized light and realizing unidirectional dynamics of electrons, which can be implemented into novel opto-electronic device applications. The research aspects of this CAREER plan are integrated with extensive opportunities for education and outreach activities. Graduate and undergraduate students are not only trained in materials science, nanofabrication, and laser physics in the principal investigator’s lab, but also involved in spectroscopy experiments using national lab facilities. Also, the research team actively engage the K-12 students and general public to convey the concept of chirality and the beauty of symmetry by developing new STEM demos and games. Technical Abstract: In condensed matter systems, the concept of dynamic chirality expands the scope of spintronics with various intriguing properties. In this process, chirality plays a critical role in the energy and angular momentum transfer among different degrees of freedom. The objective of this project is to study novel magneto-optical effects and nonreciprocal transport properties that emerge from chiral interactions between magnetic, phononic, and photonic excitations in two-dimensional materials and van der Waals heterostructures. The research team are seeking to address several most current and relevant scientific problems in spintronics: 1) How to coherently excite chiral phonons and lift chiral phonon degeneracy in an achiral material? 2) How does chirality mediate the magnon-phonon coupling in the two-dimensional limit? and 3) How to implement chiral interactions in a phonon diode device for nonreciprocal signal operation? A battery of state-of-the-art experimental techniques at the home institution and the national laboratories such as nonlinear optics, helicity-resolved Raman scattering, and ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy are employed to carry out the research tasks. This research project shed light on the emergent chiral phenomena in a broader class of materials and advance spintronics towards the interdisciplinary regime with quantum information science.

Building Habitable Worlds,"The Solar System formed from the collapse of a molecular cloud of gas and dust ~4.6 billion years ago. But how did that gas and dust coalesce into the Sun and eight planets that we see today? What processes and events led to the formation of habitable planets like the Earth? And how do conditions at the birth of the Solar System compare to what we see in other planetary systems? I will answer these questions by studying meteorites and extraterrestrial samples returned by space missions, rocky time capsules that can be used to probe the earliest stages of Solar System formation and the evolution of planets.

Water may have been delivered to habitable planets by asteroids. Two space missions, JAXA's Hayabusa2 and NASA's OSIRIS-REx, have successfully returned to Earth with samples of the water-rich asteroids Ryugu and Bennu, respectively. In addition, the fall of the Winchcombe meteorite provided the UK with complementary materials from the early Solar System. I will study the mineralogy and composition of Ryugu, Bennu, and fresh hydrated meteorites to understand the aqueous and thermal history of primitive water-rich asteroids and constrain the nature and distribution of volatiles in the protoplanetary disk.

In the last decade new computer models and the detection of exoplanets have shown that planetary systems are dramatically shaped by giant planet migration. In the Solar System, the inward and outward movement of Jupiter and Saturn caused turbulence and widespread mixing of materials from the inner and outer regions of the protoplanetary disk. I will use hypervelocity impact experiments to reproduce this mixing and determine how much water was retained in planetary surfaces following asteroid impacts.

Some meteorites come from asteroids that have remained dormant throughout their history and preserve minerals that were once swirling around the newly forming Sun. I will investigate presolar grains that condensed around ancient stars to understand their role in the formation and evolution of organic matter in interstellar space and the first stages of accretion within the Solar System.",732707,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
CAREER: Multiferroicity in van der Waals Heterostructures,"Nontechnical description: Ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials can be used to build novel quantum devices, utilizing their magnetic properties even in absence of external fields. When ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials are integrated together, forming the so-called “multiferroics”, the material functions are largely enhanced beyond the simple combination of two materials, leading to novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Especially when these materials are atomically thin, their interactions become even more exotic. The emerging ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials provide intriguing building blocks for layer-by-layer assembling of novel multiferroic heterostructures. Understanding the fundamental magnetoelectric physics underlying the multiferroicity in such heterostructures and thereby developing effective approaches to manipulate the multiferroicity, have foundational significance for advancing these emerging heterostructures for ultracompact, energy-efficient spintronic devices. This project studies the effects of electrostatic doping, electric field, interfacial chemistry, and lattice strain on the resultant multiferroicity, potentially leading to the development of engineering approaches to advance human control of the new class of functional heterostructures. Students of various levels, including graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, from all backgrounds, are trained with a broad range of expertise in 2D heterostructure assembling, nanodevice fabrication, cryogenic hardware manufacturing and operation, and a variety of microscopies and spectroscopies. This project can help strengthen the future workforce for the quantum information science and technologies in the U.S. and raise the public literacy of quantum technologies by the development of new course materials and local and regional educational activities. Technical description: The recently emerged ferromagnetic and ferroelectric 2D vdW materials are atomically thin crystals with long-range ferroic orders, providing ideal condense matter platforms for exploring the low-dimensional spin and dipole physics. When 2D ferromagnets and 2D ferroelectrics are integrated to form multiferroic heterostructures, the interplay between the disparate ferroic orders can generate a plethora of emergent magnetoelectric phenomena, potentially leading to novel low-power spintronic devices. The research objective of this project is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the magnetoelectric multiferroicity in vdW heterostructures, including charge transfer induced doping, built-in electric field, interfacial hybridization, and piezoelectric strain effect. Given these factors are ubiquitous in heterostructure systems, understanding their roles in the resultant multiferroicity can provide critical insights for designing functional vdW heterostructures, which potentially transforms the landscape of ferroic quantum heterostructures and enabling disruptive spintronic and quantum technologies. Based on these fundamental understandings, effective engineering approaches can be developed to create heterostructures with desirable magnetoelectric physical properties. The main research approaches include assembling various types of vdW multiferroic heterostructures and fabricating these heterostructures based devices, which are further engineered by electrostatic doping, electric field, and piezoelectric strain.

SWIFT-SAT: Observational Data Sharing,"Radio astronomy observatories have dealt with the impacts of radio frequency interference (RFI) since their earliest days. The realization that powerful broadcasts and sensitive scientific instruments could not easily coexist led to the creation of protected frequencies for radio astronomy and to the establishment of the National Radio Quiet Zone. These protections have been expanded over time. Nevertheless, the expansion of wireless communications to ever higher frequencies, and the advent of globe-spanning low earth orbit networks of satellites, have resulted in RFI at many more frequencies and in remote locations. The astronomy community needs solutions that enable these communications capabilities while protecting the viability of terrestrial radio telescopes. Building on prior NSF-funded design and planning work, this project will construct an Operational Data Sharing (ODS) system that supports automated, real-time spectrum sharing between radio astronomy observatories and satellite constellations. The project will deploy ODS and experiment with spectrum sharing between the Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the Starlink constellation operated by Space Exploration Technologies, Inc. (SpaceX). Students from diverse backgrounds will take part in this work as summer interns, and public awareness of spectrum issues will be enhanced by integrating real-time updates derived from the ODS system into the existing public-facing telescope status display. The planned ODS system transmits information about the radio astronomy observatory’s status and plans to the satellite operator, including the antenna pointing direction or phased array beam direction, receiver center frequency and bandwidth as a function of time. ODS is structured as a database queried by the satellite operator, so only the information needed by that operator is transmitted. The observatory and the operator mutually agree on sharing approaches. For example, that satellites pointing phased-array beams into a specified zone near the observatory will only transmit in a subset of the operator’s licensed frequencies when the observatory is actively sensing in that band. The project explores methods that enable the operator to use more spectrum than is available under current static protection approaches when the observatory is sensing at other frequencies. The initial deployment and experiments focus on the 10.7-12.7 GHz band.

Bloch wave interferometry in semiconductors and correlated insulators,"Nontechnical description: Meeting society’s future demands for information technology requires ever-increasing control over semiconducting materials, from which electronics are made, and light, which transmits vast quantities of information at continually-increasing speeds. Quantum mechanics tells us that electrons in semiconductors should behave like waves. A detailed understanding of these electronic waves is required to engineer the next generations of electronic and optical devices. Recently, using a powerful, building-sized laser to rapidly accelerate charges in a semiconductor and smash them back together before they can collide with anything else, the principle investigator’s group has been able to observe two kinds of accelerated electronic waves interfering with one another, analogous to the interaction of ripples from two stones thrown into a pond. From the pattern of the interference, the principle investigator’s group has been able, for the first time, to reconstruct directly from experimental data the mathematical form of interfering electronic waves in a semiconductor. In this project, the research team leverages the interference of electronic waves to develop a method to precisely measure important parameters that govern both the motion of charges in and the absorption and emission of light from semiconductors. The research is carried out by graduate and undergraduate student researchers who, in the process, get rigorous training in semiconductor physics, optics, and, most importantly, solving hard problems that have never been solved before. With this training, these researchers will be well-positioned to contribute to developing future information technologies in industry, academia, or government. These researchers also participate in the PI’s popular educational outreach program that has, since 2005, brought attractive, engaging and robust ""Questboards"" to local community science nights for K-12 students to get hands-on experience with electrical circuits. Technical description: Interferometry is a powerful tool for measuring information encoded in waves of all sorts. Charged quasiparticles in solids have a wavelike character that is captured in their Bloch wavefunctions. In 2011, the principle investigator’s group reported the experimental discovery of high-order sideband generation, in which a semiconductor driven simultaneously by a weak near-infrared laser and a strong THz laser can emit many dozen near-infrared sidebands in a comb-like spectrum with comb teeth separated by an integer multiple of the THz frequency. Recently, the group reported that the polarizations of sidebands emitted from bulk gallium arsenide (GaAs) can be viewed as interferograms from a Michelson-like interferometer for Bloch waves, and calculated using a simple analytical model. This project uses quantitative Bloch-wave interferometry in three ways: (1) reconstruct the effective Hamiltonian, precise band gaps, and de-phasing processes of electron-hole pairs in bulk GaAs. This will open the door to much more precise electronic structure measurements in the technologically-critical direct-gap semiconductors; (2) measure anomalous displacements (transverse to the direction of the accelerating electric field) of holes in GaAs quantum wells caused by extremely large valence band Berry curvatures. This will be among the cleanest demonstrations of anomalous velocity—first predicted nearly 70 years ago—and may enable a direct measurement of the local Berry curvature of a band; (3) extend Bloch-wave interferometry to Mott insulators, beginning with the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS3, a promising candidate because of its extremely bright and narrow exciton, opening a new window into the electronic structure of strongly-correlated insulators.

WoU-MMA: Cosmic Ray and Background Identification with RNO-G,"Neutrinos are unique messenger particles that can carry information about some of the most energetic astrophysical sources in the Universe. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) has very successfully detected astrophysical neutrinos, and discovered sources that expand our knowledge of physics at very high energy scales. There is more to discover, but a larger detector is needed to discover neutrinos at even higher energies. Measuring both cosmic rays and neutrinos at extreme energies will answer questions about both particle physics and astrophysics. This is the purpose of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) which looks for the flash of radio emission caused by an extremely energetic neutrino slamming into glacial ice. RNO-G’s full detector will cover dozens of square kilometers; at present, seven of 35 stations are taking data, and more are being built every summer. The greatest challenge is to classify and reject radio backgrounds, especially signals created by cosmic ray particles. This work involves critical simulation and classification development for RNO-G, efficiently separating out the neutrino signal. Building on knowledge from other fields, including machine learning and glaciology, the tools developed for this project will improve our ability to detect neutrinos with RNO-G. The included education and outreach efforts will make this research accessible to a broad range of scientists and to the general public. Over the course of the project, the team at Ohio State will compare leading time-domain classification techniques and build a library of analysis tools. This work will: (1) develop high-end simulated models including neutrino- and cosmic ray-induced radio emission, (2) classify the flux of cosmic rays into in-air and in-ice categories, likely detecting in-ice Askaryan emission for the first time, and (3) use machine learning to categorize backgrounds with much higher efficiency. The team will conduct both data-driven and simulation-driven studies of cosmic ray signals, comparing to neutrino simulations to optimize classifiers, and thus maximize the separation between neutrinos and backgrounds. Developed tools will enable a future successful neutrino search. This study will transform RNO-G into a true neutrino observatory for energies above 10 Pev, perhaps even above 1 Eev. This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.

Spin Quantum Dynamics in Molecular Magnets,"Non-technical abstract: This proposal seeks to consolidate an integrated experimental and educational framework for the study, understanding, and dissemination of knowledge that details the quantum magnetic properties of single-molecule magnets. The control of quantum properties of nanoscale materials has led to the appearance of new emerging technologies, such as quantum information and computation processes. Nanoscale molecular systems have great potential for ultra-high-density integration and quantum information processing, which are technologies based on the fundamental properties studied in this project. Along these lines, this project will advance a conjunction of experimental realizations to study the coupling between photons and ensembles of molecular magnets, in view of application in quantum information, molecular spintronics and related emerging quantum technologies. The research activities planned in this project will open the door to explore the quantum dynamics of spin in an energy and temperature range never explored before. This project aligns well with current national efforts on quantum technologies, as illustrated by the National Quantum Initiative Act. The proposed research is strongly integrated with a series of educational activities ongoing in the group of the principal investigator. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamental and applied physics, and exposed to a large, interdisciplinary net of collaborations worldwide that the principal investigator has established over many years of research on this area. Technical abstract: This project seeks to consolidate an integrated experimental and educational framework for the study, understanding, and dissemination of knowledge that details the magnetic properties of single-molecule magnets under a broad range of experimental conditions. The main scientific goal of this project is to study the nature of light-matter interaction in single-molecule and single-ion magnets and achieve quantum coherent control over the molecular spin. The planned studies of spin-photon interactions in low-nuclearity single-molecule magnets, including mononuclear molecular systems and single-ion magnets, where the magnetism arises from a single magnetic ion, will allow to coherently control the time evolution of the molecular spins upon application of fast pulsed microwave irradiation in the weak coupling regime at sub-Kelvin temperatures (>50 mK), for which dipolar dephasing will be suppressed due to polarization of the spin bath without the need of large magnetic fields. This will open a window into the fundamental sources of decoherence in single crystals of molecular spins in an energy range never explored before. The enhanced spin-photon couplings factors of mononuclear molecular magnets together with the enhancement of the microwave magnetic field expected from nanoconstricted superconducting resonators of extremely high quality factors may allow demonstrating the strong coupling between a vacuum photon mode and a single molecular spin, a milestone not yet achieved in magnetism. The proposed investigations have great potential to advance ultra-high-density integration and quantum information processing technologies, and therefore the outcomes arising from the proposed studies may lead to new and revolutionary quantum technologies. This project aligns well with current national efforts on quantum technologies, as illustrated by the National Quantum Initiative Act.

Bridging the Gap Between Particle-Based and Continuum Hydrodynamic Descriptions of Dusty Plasma,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize science by uncovering new physical laws governing natural systems. From the inner workings of the human brain to the chaotic patterns of Earth’s weather and climate, AI will play a role in how we make new discoveries. However, we are just now learning how to adapt AI to do this. This award supports an effort aimed to tackle a piece of this problem using data from the motion of many interacting individuals, be it planetary bodies, flocks of birds, or charged particles within a plasma. In a plasma, electrons are separated from their atoms, and any present dust particles become charged and interact through electric forces. Such ""dusty plasmas"" are common throughout the universe and our solar system, from the surface of the moon to the rings of Saturn. In a laboratory, the complex motion of the dust particles is monitored using modern high-speed cameras and lasers. With this data, the following questions can be answered: What are the forces driving these particles? How can their states (liquid, solid, etc.) be classified? Can AI be used to derive a simple mathematical understanding of dusty plasma? In addition to the research, this award facilitates many educational activities and public scientific outreach, such as an after-school science club for 4th and 5th graders at a local elementary school. Physics-inspired machine learning (ML) is an emerging field in physics and computer science. The dynamical collective motion of many elemental constituents, such swarms of microorganisms or particles in a plasma, are often influenced by unknown, local interactions between the constituents and couplings to external fields. Yet, most state-of-the-art ML techniques are tested on simulated data. In recent years, ML has successfully inferred parsimonious equations describing simulated complex systems where the underlying physics is known. However, few new laws of physics have been inferred from experimental data. Dusty plasmas (DP), composed of micron-sized particles immersed in weakly-ionized plasma, provide the ideal bridge between theory and real, noisy data. This project uses a custom scanning laser-sheet tomography technique that tracks the motion of particles in three dimensions for tens of minutes. Importantly, the symmetries that govern this DP system are built into the ML models. Environmental and interparticle forces can be teased apart in DPs dominated by 2-body interactions, and statistical approaches that seek lower-dimensional representations of the physics can be used for highly dynamic systems of many particles. These lower-dimensional representations are used to seed ML approaches that can discover equations of motion from experimental data, thereby facilitating the discovery of new physical and statistical laws in regimes where simple approximations commonly used in DPs break down.

High energy Intelligence,"Understanding the basic building blocks of Nature has led to the Standard Model, a non abelian quantum field theory with particles and glue that explains within a single framework the forces between the basic constituents of matter. However, the description of strongly coupled emergent phenomena has remained a hard problem to solve, especially with traditional methods. In recent years, new techniques have challenged this difficulty by showing that an optimized knowledge of symmetries and consistency conditions actually leads to unprecedented quantitative results. Both the conformal and the amplitude bootstrap have proven this idea to be successful. A first objective of the High-energy Intelligence -HeI- project is to extend the horizon of applicability of bootstrap methods by finding better constraints and more rigorous predictions, eg. as path towards quantum chromodynamics (QCD) study the conformal window of QCD-like theories, study integrable and supersymmetric theories, and for quantum gravity, study those theories that have a gravitational dual within string theory.  A second objective of the HeI project, specific and original, is to push the boundaries of our understanding of QCD physics, by obtaining the most refined partonic distribution functions of quarks and gluons in nuclear matter. A third objective, timely and novel in the proposed approach, is to combine an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning training with cutting-edge research in theoretical physics, having in mind neural networks designs that can be trained on partial data sets, and at the same time, solve the non-perturbative constraint equations coming from theory.

CAREER: Design and synthesis of functional van der Waals magnets,"Non-technical abstract: Understanding and controlling the physical properties of materials is important for both scientific research and technological advancement. This project conducts a comprehensive experimental investigation to unveil the underlying magnetic energy scales that affect long-range magnetic ordering in van der Waals magnets. The successful acquisition of this information is pivotal to the fundamental understanding of magnetism in low-dimensional systems and broader progress in quantum materials. The novel materials design and synthesis part of this project aims to generate a large pool of newly available compounds that exhibit a wide range of magnetic properties. These new magnets further contribute to the emergent field of quantum magnetism, essential for realizing the quantum revolution in future technologies. The education plan integrates with this research project by broadening education in magnetism and condensed-matter experimental techniques at multiple levels to benefit graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students. The education plan also promotes the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion in physics consistent with the University of Arizona’s institutional commitments and designation as a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Technical abstract: Magnetism offers a unique avenue for manipulating physical properties at the nanoscale. However, the development of low-dimensional magnetism faces significant constraints due to a limited understanding of magnetic properties and a lack of available layered magnetic materials. The goals of this project are to advance the understanding of low dimensional magnetic ordering through systematic thermodynamic characterization, and to synthesize new magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials that will play a major role in future electronics. Experimental efforts focus on systematically characterizing the magnetic exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropy of bulk vdW magnets through low-temperature magnetization and heat capacity measurements. These experimental results are crucial for a quantitative understanding of the key factors that influence the magnetic properties of layered magnets in both bulk form and at the two-dimensional limit. The project team also aims to design and synthesize new functional vdW magnets that exhibit a controlled magnetic behavior and high magnetic ordering temperature by integrating chemistry and physics guiding principles. This project taps into underdeveloped areas that include rare earth magnetism and perovskite-type structures, which offer a wide tunability in both electronic and magnetic states. Results from exploratory synthesis experiments are made publicly available, contributing to a balanced training dataset for future machine learning developments aimed at accelerating new material discovery.

MRI: Equipment: A New CeBr3 Gamma-Ray Detection Array (CeBrA) for Particle-Gamma Coincidence Experiments at the FSU Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph,"This award provides support for Ursinus College, a primarily undergraduate institution, to upgrade the particle-gamma ray coincidence capabilities at the John D. Fox Laboratory at Florida State University (FSU) by expanding the existing array of low-background CeBr3 scintillation detectors used to measure gamma rays in coincidence with particles collected by Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SE-SPS) following nuclear reactions. This combined setup will enable selective and detailed studies of nuclear-structure phenomena, of which many are also relevant for understanding nuclear reactions taking place in explosive stellar environments. The development of this array, known as CeBrA, will be performed by the PI and undergraduate students at Ursinus College in collaboration with co-PIs from Florida State University (FSU) and Ohio University (OU). This new instrument will be a significant upgrade of present particle-gamma coincidence capabilities at FSU, will enable access to low-energy nuclear science facilities, and contribute to the education and training of the next generation of nuclear scientists. Those involved in this project will gain skills in using radiation detectors, troubleshooting, gathering, and analyzing data, and preparing results for publication. The funds from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will create an instrument for the measurement of gamma-rays in coincidence with charged particles detected in the SE-SPS. The planned CeBrA will consist of 14 low-background CeBr3 scintillation detectors with Hamamatsu photomultipliers read out with CAEN digitizers. The energy resolution of the CeBr3 detectors is sufficient to disentangle g decays leading to different excited states, enabling experimental programs complimentary to those at rare isotope facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. The initial testing and characterization of the CeBr3 detectors will be performed at Ursinus College. This stage will provide a unique possibility for the undergraduate students to get exposed to modern g-ray spectroscopy techniques and instruments at their home institution. At the same time, a GEANT4 simulation of the different detectors will be developed at Ursinus with support from FSU and OU.

THz integrated platform for coherence distribution and quantum materials spectroscopy,"THz radiation generation and detection is nowadays at the centre of intense theoretical and experimental efforts. Spanning from 0.5 to 10 THz, this frequency range holds significant importance in fundamental research and practical applications alike. Telecommunications, spectroscopy, bio-imaging, non-destructive evaluation, radio-astronomy, condensed matter spectroscopy, frequency metrology are just some of the areas where THz radiation is largely employed. Compact, coherent, powerful and frequency agile sources of THz radiation are especially important in all these contexts.  In our previous  Project (200021_212735) we laid down the foundations of a THz integrated photonic platform: as a result, we have presently developed powerful frequency comb sources  are now operating with high powers (>10 mW), displaying broadband comb bandwidths (>850 GHz), above liquid nitrogen temperature (>110 K) with a low-diverging beam.In the present proposal we will leverage on our advancements and branch out on three main research lines that address particularly important areas of THz science and technology. We believe that the proposed activities will have an tremendous impact on fundamental research (laser physics, combs, low temperature spectroscopy)as well as on applications (telecom, high resolution spectroscopy ).We plan to organize our work along the following research directions: 1. Broadband, high-performance combs and lasers and coherent THz Frequency synthesis with arbitrary repetition rate} Leveraging on the ultrafast gain dynamics of the QCLs combined with the microwave characteristics of the double metal resonators we will develop fully-controllable, monolithic frequency combs where /the repetition rate is not anymore related to the physical dimension of the cavity but solely determined by the RF modulation frequency. Such devices will have a disruptive impact in spectroscopy and in dual comb spectroscopy as it will unlock the pairing of different lasers in a dual comb setup. Pulses with arbitrary repetition rate will be produced from an on-chip device.  2. THz integrated optics and THz combs onto telecom carrier for coherent THz distribution. In this section we will expand the development of integrated THz optical components. We will especially develop antennas, couplers and WDM's to bridge THz combs and telecom photonics. As an integrated THz source we will develop circular racetrack resonators coupled to active bus waveguide to route and amplify THz solitons demonstrated in the previous proposal.    We will then upconvert the THz combs with optimized output beam profile onto a telecom carrier using Lithium Niobate modulators for coherent THz distribution and locking. First we will rely on free-space coupling, moving later to on-chip integration. Such a tool will have important impact on applications as THz high precision spectroscopy and THz telecommunications.       3.  Planarized THz lab-on-a-chip platform for low temperature THz spectroscopy experimemts (Cryo-SNOM, high resolution spectroscopy)  We will develop THz QCLs for applications in nanophotonics and near field THz nanoscopy. Low dissipation, planarized devices will be the stepping stone for developing a low-temperature lab-on-a-chip  THz platform. By moving the THz source inside the cryostat, we aim at producing, routing and delivering THz signals to specific interaction regions. A carefully engineered near-field profile will provide efficient coupling to a variety of highly relevant quantum materials as multilayer 2D structures (twisted bilayer graphene, TMD's, Van der Waals heterostructures, single molecules etc...). We envision and target the development of two experiments: (i) background-free THz cyro snom and (ii) on-chip dual comb spectrometer.The project will last 36 months and will be carried out at ETH Zürich at the Institute for Quantum Electronics.",719343,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
CAREER: Integrating Magnetism into Noncentrosymmetric Frameworks for Spin-based Electronics,"Non-technical summary Imagine smart, compact notebooks with more space to store games, photos, and videos, sleek cell phones with quicker-loading apps and longer battery life, and powerful, unparalleled computers that can solve complex problems much faster than today computers. While such innovative computers and memory devices could revolutionize our lives through energy savings, environmental conservation, national security, and healthcare, it is difficult to unlock the potential of magnetic materials that are the basis of the next generation of electronic architectures. This CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to develop a deeper understanding of the chemistry-function relationships of solid-state materials potentially hosting tiny magnets, which can twist and turn in a unique way. The twisty dance of these small magnets could enable higher data storage capabilities, faster data access, and more efficient spin-based logic devices. The PI and her team will focus on a particular class of magnetic compounds that lack inversion symmetry in the structure and study how chemical bonding in these materials determines their physical properties. In addition, this CAREER award seeks to improve student STEM competency and promote solid-state materials through the design, refinement, and dissemination of inquiry-based animation called Adventures in Materials Discovery. Technical summary Noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials hosting topological spin textures (skyrmions) are at the forefront of new technological advances in quantum information science and spintronics. This is owing to topological protection, a strange state wherein the physical properties of electrons are insensitive to defects and noisy environments such as lattice imperfections and room-temperature operations. While impressive achievements have been made in skyrmion materials research, a significant challenge remains as to how chemical bonding and electronic structures give rise to the emergence and intentional modification of skyrmions. The research goal of this CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), is to provide an efficient set of fundamental chemistry-property guidelines for new noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials that facilitates (or hinders) the formation of skyrmions. To achieve this, the PI and her team adopt combined experimental and computational approaches using state-of-the-art synthetic techniques, magnetic and heat capacity measurements, X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, and density functional theory calculations. The education goal of this CAREER award is to improve student learning and promote interest in quantum STEM disciplines. The PI and her team will design, refine, and disseminate inquiry-based activities called Adventure in Materials Discovery with five animated modules (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Silicon Age, and Quantum Age) that will engage and excite students and the public about the impacts of solid-state materials in addressing real-world challenges.

The Origin of Massive Stars (ORMAS),"High-mass stars, although less common than Sun-like stars, have a profound impact on their galaxies. These stars end their lives in supernova explosions, creating heavy elements necessary for life, creating turbulence, and even causing large-scale movements known as galactic fountains. The ORMAS project team will investigate two critical questions: How do high-mass stars form? and What determines their mass? ORMAS will use advanced supercomputer simulations to explore supernova-induced turbulence, which might compress interstellar gas enough to form these stars. ORMAS also aims to reduce the environmental impact of computational science by developing energy-efficient computing strategies and promoting carbon-neutral data centers through outreach and education. The goal of the ORMAS project is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the origin of massive stars and to derive a general model of their mass function. Because stellar luminosity, chemical yields, and mechanical feedbacks are non-linear functions of stellar mass, massive stars have a disproportional impact on galaxy evolution. The growth of a massive star is a problem involving turbulent mass transport through a wide range of dynamically coupled scales. ORMAS will take advantage of recent advances in task-based asynchronous computing (the new DISPATCH code) to address this problem with computational models covering 9 orders of magnitude in spatial scales, from 0.1 AU to 250 pc, simulating the formation and evolution of realistic stellar clusters, including stellar outflows and photo-ionization regions, under a self-consistent, large-scale turbulent driving by supernovae. Through a detailed analysis of the interactions between the stellar feedback mechanisms and the turbulent mass transport during the growth of a massive star, ORMAS will identify the basic ingredients for a new model of the stellar mass function. ORMAS's legacy will also include large catalogs of synthetic observations of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters with up to a million stars.

CAREER: Tunable Connate Topological Superconductivity in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides,"Non-Technical Abstract: Superconducting and quantum-based technologies are promising avenues for realizing faster and more efficient computation, energy-efficient transport of electricity, and novel methods that enhance the capabilities of materials metrology. One scheme for realizing robust reading of quantum states for such technologies is to combine superconductivity with electronic states that only exist at the edges of materials, resulting in a special state that merges these two properties: connate topological superconductivity. Few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides are a promising subclass of materials that have been predicted to exhibit connate topological superconductivity and are highly tunable with moderate changes to the electrostatic environment. In this project, the research team aims to discover, develop, and electrostatically control connate topological superconducting behavior in semimetallic and superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. The success of this project will introduce new methods with which to probe novel forms of superconductivity and lead to greater insight into the general mechanisms that govern superconductivity. In addition, this project integrates graduate and undergraduate students into the research effort and develops and runs outreach activities for K-12 students in collaboration with teachers from local school districts. Technical Abstract: A two-dimensional connate topological superconductor is a unique system where the bulk interior of a two-dimensional material exhibits superconductivity while the edge simultaneously hosts a topologically nontrivial state. As a result, the bulk superconductivity induces superconductivity in the nontrivial edge states, giving rise to superconducting edge states. The goal of this project is to discover, develop, and electrostatically control connate topological superconductivity and the concomitant superconducting edge states in noncentrosymmetric, T’ and Td, two-dimensional superconductors. Connate topological superconductivity has been proposed for a number of bulk materials, but the experimental evidence for and manipulation of connate topological superconductivity has remained limited due to strong electronic screening caused by a large concentration of charge carriers across many atomic layers. Atomically thin T’ and Td superconductors with moderate charge carrier concentrations offer an opportunity to better understand and control connate topological superconductivity phenomena. Because of the low electronic screening, the behavior of two-dimensional connate topological superconductors may be tuned without introducing disorder via electrostatic gating. Realizing a connate topological superconductor and the associated superconducting edge states, which are beyond the scope of standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, would give crucial insight into how superconductivity can emerge without strictly being facilitated by phonons and could be useful for engineering qubits with long coherence times.

CAREER: Investigating Fluid Surface Dynamics in Constrained Geometries,"Non-technical Abstract: When a pipe springs a leak, or raindrops leave streaks of droplets on a windshield, or Cheerios spontaneously clump together in a bowl of milk, we see everyday examples of the dynamics of fluid surfaces. This research project seeks to understand the fundamental science behind these dynamics and related phenomena by developing an experimental laboratory program for exploring and controlling the interactions between fluids and solid surfaces. Using high-magnification microscopes, high-speed videography, and digital image processing, the research team captures complex interactions between surface tension, viscosity, and flow speed as pipes leak, liquids break up into droplets on surfaces, and solid particles form patterns and shatter on the surfaces of fluids. By coupling the experimental observations, data analysis, and theory, this research yields novel insights into the fundamental physics of everyday phenomena that have potential applications in a range of scientific fields and industries. This project also has significant educational impact by affording dozens of undergraduate students opportunities to engage directly in cutting-edge research at a critical stage in their college careers. Technical Abstract: This research program investigates how geometric constraints—both local and global—interact with and change the dynamics of fluid surfaces and their instabilities in two main contexts. The first aim seeks to understand the fundamental physics that governs flow transitions in partially-wetting, thin fluid “leaks,” including rivulet breakup and oscillation cycles between flow start and spontaneous arrest. The second aim explores capillary-driven interactions, spontaneous pattern formation, and Marangoni-driven surface fracture on flat and curved fluid surfaces with adsorbed species from the granular to the macromolecular scale. The research team employs imaging, microscopy, and high-speed videography, and digital image analysis to quantify and understand fluid surface dynamics in custom built, tabletop experiments. Each experimental system is chosen to exemplify key aspects of the overarching research questions, unified by common experimental techniques and governing physical principles.

CAREER: One-Pot Synthesis and Optical Spectroscopy of 2D Heterobilayers,"Nontechnical Description New technologies benefitting society depend on developing novel materials. Monolayers, materials composed of layers that are only one molecule or one atom thick, have shown promise for next-generation electronics and computing. Heterobilayers made by stacking monolayers with different orientations or chemical compositions have led to materials with novel properties such as unconventional superconductivity. However, current approaches based on producing bulk materials and then isolating thin layers from them cannot be easily scaled. The aim of this project is to develop new pathways for assembling atomically thin bilayers that are free of wrinkles and impurities at the interfaces. The principal investigator (PI) takes advantage of the most stable configurations that arise when bilayers are built by a bottom-up approach. This approach consists of putting atoms together one by one to form a crystal. In addition to fabricating novel bilayers, investigators will optically study novel phenomena that can arise by changing the substrate upon which heterobilayers are built. This research goes hand in hand with the goal of forming the next-generation physics and material science workforce through a comprehensive educational program that broadens the workforce base and improves recruitment and retention of undergraduate students in related fields. The PI is working with an outreach team to design and build demonstrations targeted to K-5 students, with the goal of reaching over 500 students per year. This project implements two Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences that are closely integrated with the research objectives to improve the recruitment and retention of undergraduate students and broaden the future workforce base. Educational activities also include communication workshops to increase students’ science communication skills. Technical Description Two-dimensional (2D) materials hold great promise for positive impacts on technology and society, including innovations in electronics, clean energy, photonics, and quantum information. Individual 2D layers can be stacked to assemble artificial bilayers bonded by van der Waals (vdW) forces. A critical challenge in heterobilayer development is the elimination of bottlenecks associated with top-down mechanical exfoliation and stacking, including the need for interfacial impurity mitigation protocols. The first research objective of this project is growing heterobilayers using combinations of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with different bandgaps. In this TMD heterobilayers, moiré patterns originate from the difference between lattice parameters among the constituent layers. The second research objective is to identify optical spectroscopy signatures, including moiré phonons and electronic transitions, displayed by the heterobilayers for each TMD combination–including those with type-I and type-II band alignments. The research approach is based on a single-pot chemical vapor deposition route to grow heterobilayers with a thermodynamically preferred stacking order, in the absence of mechanical exfoliation and transferring techniques. Strain in heterobilayers is controlled through the difference in the lattice parameter of the constituent layers and the coefficient of thermal expansion of both TMD layers and the growth substrate. This enables the study and understanding of the changes in TMDs’ resonant Raman spectra and the energy variations in interlayer excitons in 2D heterobilayers driven by strain.

Quantum Simulation and Collisions with Ultracold Triatomic Molecules,"Atoms and molecules are the microscopic building blocks of the world. Their behavior and interactions are governed by the theory of quantum mechanics, which describes at a fundamental level much of modern science and technology. Advancing quantum science and technology with atoms and molecules requires cooling to temperatures around one millionth of a degree above absolute zero and exquisitely controlling their structure in the quantum mechanical realm. Over the past several decades, powerful laser cooling techniques have been developed to reach these “ultracold” temperatures with atoms; in turn, a number of discoveries were made that shed light on the intricacies of quantum physics in complicated systems and made progress toward the creation of a useful quantum computer. These techniques have more recently been extended to diatomic molecules (containing two atoms), and very recently to larger, “polyatomic” molecules. Now, Professor John Doyle and his research team of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers will use laser-cooled CaOH (calcium monohydroxide) molecules to study the complex physics governing polyatomic molecules at ultracold temperatures. There are two primary aims of the research. The first is to study collisions of ultracold CaOH molecules, which will shed light on the quantum physics underlying molecular interactions and ultracold chemistry. The second is to control arrays of CaOH molecules at the level needed to build a quantum computer, both by controlling individual molecules in the array and by engineering their interactions. The resulting quantum computer could be used for powerful quantum simulations, e.g. for the development of new technological materials. Additionally, students will be trained in advanced, highly technical experimental methods, adding to the scientific human infrastructure of the nation. Professor Doyle and his research team will carry out this research using ultracold CaOH molecules in optical traps (bulk optical dipole traps as well as individual molecules in optical tweezers), using experimental techniques recently developed by the team. They will study the collisions of triatomic molecules in detail and develop techniques for quantum control of collisions, in particular by using the specific structure of polyatomic molecules to shield molecules from lossy short-range interactions, with the vision of carving a path towards a degenerate quantum gas of polyatomic molecules. Direct tests will be made of theory, leading to a better understanding of the relatively unknown territory of quantum-controlled collisions of polyatomic molecules. Researchers will also develop methods to control polyatomic molecules in optical tweezers for use in analog quantum simulators and as qubits in quantum information processing systems. The specific goal is to first characterize the coherence time of potential qubit states that take advantage of the unique structures present in polyatomic molecules. Professor Doyle and his research team will then use dipolar interactions to entangle CaOH molecules in adjacent optical tweezers and use these interactions to engineer quantum gates between polyatomic molecules.

ADMIRA: Adaptive Dynamic and MIxed-beam RAdiotherapy,"1. Summary of the research plan1.1. Background and rationaleAdaptive radiotherapy (ART) is rapidly advancing clinical radiotherapy (RT). We plan to maximize the therapeutic benefit of next-generation cancer treatments by developing novel adaptive strategies for dynamic and mixed-beam RT. Delivering accurate RT is challenging because normal physiological processes and treatment change a patient’s anatomy. For example, patients with head and neck (HN) cancer lose weight during treatment, so non-adaptive RT eventually delivers higher doses than needed to their healthy tissues, causing salivary and swallowing dysfunction after RT. As another example, in patients with esophageal RT, digestion and respiration shift the position of the tumor from day to day. To account for anatomical changes, treatment plans typically irradiate volume centimeters larger than the visible tumor to ensure it will be completely irradiated, so these plans also deliver high doses of radiation to the lungs and the heart, which frequently causes pulmonary and cardiac toxicity that reduces quality of life and can sometimes be fatal. Today’s ART platforms allow to create a new plan for each day of treatment, increasing our confidence that we are irradiating the tumor and minimizing the dose to organs-at-risks (OAR). But these specialized platforms use only one photon energy and the plan configuration is limited to simple coplanar beam direction. Our group has developed novel dynamic and mixed-beam RT treatment techniques that optimize beam directions for individual patient anatomy and combine photon and electron beams. We used planning image datasets to demonstrate that dynamic and mixed-beam RT better spares OARs and limits irradiation to the tumor more effectively than standard photon-only coplanar techniques. We next intend to improve on existing RT treatments by developing adaptive solutions for dynamic and mixed-beam RT. We need to translate the benefits of dynamic and mixed-beam RT from treatment planning images to real world scenarios in which patient anatomy changes daily and to exploit advanced treatment techniques for ART, where we can adjust beam directions and combine photon and electron beams during treatment adaptation.1.2. Overall objectivesOur overall objective is to improve RT treatments in the adaptive era by developing cutting-edge tools and workflows for efficient adaptive dynamic and mixed-beam RT. Specifically, we will determine if our improvements increase the efficacy of cancer treatment for HN and esophageal cancer under real world conditions.1.3. Specific aimsAim 1: Devise advanced adaptive strategies for dynamic and mixed-beam RT.Aim 2: Develop fast, automated tools that allow efficient adaptation of treatment plans.Aim 3: Test the benefits of adaptive dynamic and mixed-beam RT for large clinically motivated cohorts.Aim 4: Verify and perform risk analysis for adaptive dynamic and mixed-beam RT.1.4. Expected results and impactWe expect that dynamic and mixed-beam RT will make treatment plans more adaptable than current techniques. To test our theory, we will use dosimetric endpoints and toxicity prediction models to determine if adaptive dynamic and mixed-beam RT is effective for large clinically motivated cohorts of HN and esophageal cancer patients. We anticipate that this project is going to significantly improve adaptive RT treatments; our results will help more cancer patients live longer, healthier lives.",699394,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
BSM-PM: Investigation of the Low-Lying Nuclear Isomeric Transition in Thorium-229,"This award supports the development and exploration of the low-lying nuclear isomeric transition in the A = 229 isotope of thorium. This transition is expected to allow the construction of a nuclear optical clock with performance exceeding that of current atomic clocks. This enhanced performance will allow improvement of global positioning, communication, inertial navigation, and sensing systems. It will also provide the most sensitive test to date, by several orders of magnitude, of the variability of the fundamental constants of nature as well as new methods for searching for ultralight dark matter. The main research objective of this project is to develop techniques, including laser systems, crystals, and protocols, for using the nuclear transition for these goals as well as to understand the effects of the crystalline host on the nuclear transition. This project thus has the ability to aid the progress of science and in the near-term bolster national prosperity and security. Very recently, with NSF support, the PI demonstrated laser excitation and measurement of this nuclear transition at 8.355733(2)stat(10)sys eV in a 229Th-doped LiSrAlF6 crystals. The PI and his group observed a radiative lifetime for this transition of 568(13)stat(20)sys s in the crystal. This lifetime is sufficient for a high performance, solid-state based nuclear optical clock. Through this award, these researchers will further refine this measurement by use of a narrower laser system, study the effects on the nucleus due to the crystalline environment, and begin preparation for a measurement of the variability of the fundamental constants. Further, the group will work to explore alternative crystal hosts to the currently employed LiSrAlF6 crystal that may offer improved performance as well as novel, improved laser systems for creating the necessary 148 nm photons for control of this transition. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to break open a new field in nuclear physics by providing means for full quantum control of a nucleus. Finally, this proposal will also allow the training of several high school and undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher in state-of-the-art techniques and modern science. Past students have gone on to careers in the quantum workforce, government labs, and the private sector. The PI anticipates the current students will have similar broad impacts on our country’s workforce.

Interacting Atoms in Optical Lattices,"The PI and his group will perform a series of experiments with gases of atoms confined in one dimension (1D). 1D gases are the rare many-body quantum system that can be accurately modeled theoretically, even when they are taken out of equilibrium. Their out-of-equilibrium behavior can also be precisely measured experimentally. For two decades, parallel progress in 1D gas experiments and theory have increased our understanding of many-body quantum systems, especially out of equilibrium. Such understanding is increasingly important for quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum sensing. These new experiments will expand the reach of 1D gas models by controllably relaxing the aspect of 1D gases that has made them so amenable to theoretical study, a feature called “integrability”. The 1D gases will be taken from nearly integrable to non-integrable, along a path that retains the experimental precision and explanatory clarity that has characterized previous 1D gas studies. Success will bring us closer to a universal understanding of many-body quantum dynamics, deepening our understanding of nature and likely impacting emerging quantum technologies. Work on these experiments will teach graduate students cutting edge technologies and physical theories and prepare them for future work across the gamut of quantum science and technologies. The PI and his group will make a series of measurements of 1D Bose gases, which consist of ultra-cold 87Rb atoms trapped in a 2D optical lattice, which forms a 2D array of tubes for the atoms. Specifically, they will superimpose an additional 1D lattice onto the 1D gases, creating a 1D lattice-gas. The additional 1D lattice turns the system from nearly integrable to non-integrable. The group will measure the 1D lattice-gas analog of well-studied quantities of the 1D gas, both in an out of equilibrium. These quantities include momentum distributions and distributions of rapidities, which are the momenta of the quasiparticles that account for interparticle interactions. The lattice-gas versions of these quantities are well-defined operationally in much of the non-integrable regime. The goal is to use them as the basis for modeling dynamics. The overarching goal is to create as universal a framework as possible for the study of out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Understanding the dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is important for validating quantum simulations, especially with atoms in optical lattices. The understanding gleaned could also be relevant to other closed or nearly closed interacting quantum systems, including quantum computers and quantum sensors, especially those that involve squeezing or other particle-particle interactions. The training in experimental physics obtained by undergraduates and graduate students working on this experiment is comprehensive; it is good preparation for many different types of experimental work.

"Synthesis and curvature-controlled properties of superconducting nanotubes, helices and interconnected 3D networks","Superconducting thin films have regained an enormous interest in view of the ongoing quantum revolution in information processing and computation. For the high-density integration of future circuits, three-dimensional (3D) architectures of nano-structured superconductors become particularly important. However, the on-chip fabrication and investigation of 3D superconducting nanodevices and networks are not yet state of the art. Recent theoretical and experimental studies show that unconventional properties appear when a superconductor is patterned into surfaces with curvature radii below a few 100 nm. Unique functionalities for dissipation-less electronics and sensing are expected. However, superconductor structures with nanoscale radii have only rarely been created and explored. Studies on multiple-connected 3D nanoarchitectures await their realization as an appropriate nano-technology is not yet available. In this project, we plan to advance atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nitride superconductors and thereby create unprecedented topological 3D nanostructures which exhibit curvature radii down to about 10 nm. By means of sequentially injected precursor materials and self-limiting chemical reactions, ALD provides the conformal coating of arbitrarily curved nanotemplates (scaffolds) with a precision of a mono-molecule layer. To our knowledge, such a process has not yet been established for curved superconductors and 3D networks of multiple-connected nanotubes. By optimizing the materials synthesis via ALD we aim at precisely controlled compositions, homogeneous thicknesses of superconducting shells and granular structure. In particular, we plan to optimize the ALD growth of NbN, TiN, and NbTiN on high-aspect ratio nanotemplates and 3D polymeric nanoscaffolds realized by two-photon lithography with high spatial resolution. As type-II superconductors, they offer a wide range of coherence lengths and London penetration depths. Their critical temperatures vary from about 4 to 14 K. Depending on the composition, we expect to induce either global or local effects on identically curved nanotemplates in differently applied magnetic fields. The addressed effects and phenomena range from the creation and dynamics of chain-like topological defects (Abrikosov vortices) via topologically nontrivial screening currents and curvature-induced phase slips of the superconducting order parameter to phase transitions in the destructive regime of Little-Parks oscillations which might give rise to topological superconductivity. We expect the proposed synthesis methodology to open completely new experimental avenues for the exploration of topology-controlled superconducting properties in individual 3D nanodevices and frustration effects in large-area networks of 3D interconnected superconducting nanotubes. Beyond that, we plan to optimize the granular structure of NbN such that DC and AC Josephson effects occur at specific nanoconstrictions in a 3D network. The corresponding Josephson junctions will be novel and key elements to create functional 3D quantum circuits. They will allow one to produce superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in a 3D architecture giving rise to e.g. nanoscale magnetic field vectorial quantum sensors on a chip.",694207,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics
Microscopy of Frustrated Quantum Gases in Optical Lattices,"General audience abstract: New materials are a primary driver of new technologies. Quantum materials are promising for applications in computing, power storage and transfer, and low power electronics. In quantum materials, the electrons interact strongly with each other giving rise to new forms of matter. Simulating the physics of these materials is important for designing their properties. However, studying large quantum systems with computer simulations is an extremely difficult computational problem. The PI and his team will instead use programmable simulators based on vapors of atoms and molecules cooled to very low temperatures and trapped in a vacuum chamber using interfering laser beams. This approach, known as quantum simulation, has already provided valuable insights into the physics of quantum materials, enabling the exploration of microscopic processes that give rise to their unusual properties. In this project, the research team will focus on studying quantum systems that are “frustrated”. In such systems, there are competing constraints that make it difficult to reach the lowest energy configuration. The investigators will explore new phases of matter that appear in frustrated systems such as magnets that are robust to very high temperatures. The main outcome of the project will be to advance our fundamental understanding of the microscopic physics of frustrated quantum systems. Additionally, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students in techniques of atomic and molecular physics and prepare them for careers in the emerging quantum industry, academia and national labs. Technical audience abstract: Frustrated systems are a frontier research area in quantum many-body physics. In such systems, various contributions to the energy cannot be simultaneously minimized. This leads to novel ordered states of matter and exotic phases such as quantum spin liquids. The PI and his students will use ultracold gases of atoms and molecules to perform microscopic studies of various phenomena in frustrated systems, exploring two different kinds of frustration: geometric and exchange frustration. In one line of experiments, they will study doped fermionic Mott insulators in a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice, where they have previously observed kinetic magnetism resulting from the formation of a novel magnetic polaron. The team will perform a spectroscopic study of this system to test theoretical predictions of particularly large binding energies for such polarons. They will also search for related polarons with more complex internal structure which may facilitate hole-pairing at high temperatures. They will study manifestations of spin frustration in the equation of state of the triangular Hubbard model, looking for signatures of a Pomeranchuk effect near half-filling. In another line of experiments, the investigators will develop a platform to study frustrated magnetism with polar molecules induced by their dipolar interactions, even in the absence of geometric frustration. Long-term impacts of the proposed work include: the identification of potential new routes to high-temperature superconductivity in kinetically frustrated materials, advancing polar molecules as a platform for quantum computation and understanding spin liquid states which may be used as robust quantum memories with a high degree of immunity to environmental noise.

CAREER: Robust Coherence and High Sensitivity in Metal-Ion Nuclear-Spin Qubits,"In this CAREER grant, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Joseph Zadrozny of the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University aims to develop new classes of molecules with environmentally sensitive quantum properties. Such fundamental research lies at the core of efforts to establish new systems for quantum sensing and/or quantum computing. The goal of the research is to understand how to amplify environmental detection by the quantum states of metal-ion magnetic nuclei, which would be essential for the development of next-generation quantum bits or magnetic resonance imaging sensors. The project lies at the interface of coordination chemistry, physics, and quantum information science and will thus educate scientists at all levels in these areas. Outreach activities with a local science museum and through a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) kit are planned as new ways to expose students at an early stage to the exciting but complex quantum world. The quantum states of nuclear spins in metal complexes are generally long-lived owing to weak environmental sensitivity. Understanding how to amplify this sensitivity may lead to systems that are highly environmentally sensitive yet with long-lived quantum states, which is a fundamental challenge. In this project, Dr.Joseph Zadrozny and his team will study hybrid electronic/nuclear spin systems in order to understand how to control environmental sensitivity. Three specific classes of hybrid electron/nuclear complexes will be prepared to answer the following questions: 1) Can spin-crossovers be harnessed to amplify the environmental sensing by metal-ion nuclear spins? 2) Can valence tautomerizations be used to effect environmental detection capabilities by a metal-ion nuclear spin? 3) What are the design principles for a radical satellite to best amplify the response of metal-ion spin dynamics to changes in local chemistry?

Polarized Electron Physics,"Electrons have the fundamental property of “spin,” which is analogous to that of a spinning top, and is associated with their angular momentum. This project studies collisions between polarized electrons, which have their spins aligned in one direction, and chiral, or “handed” molecules. Such molecules, of which DNA is an example, are characterized by a spiral, or helical geometry. These experiments address physics questions about the dynamics of electron-chiral molecule scattering, particularly with regard to the magnetic effects caused by the electron spins. They will also provide important clues about the origins of biological homochirality – the fact that all naturally-occurring DNA spirals in the same direction. A source of polarized electrons called a rubidium spin filter is being used in this work; it has the advantage that it is insensitive to the contamination by chiral target molecules that has plagued earlier experiments using polarized electron sources based on photoemission from GaAs. Molecules of hydrogen (that are not chiral) are also being studied. Hydrogen is the simplest molecule, but its interaction with very slow electrons is poorly understood. This project will use very slow electrons that have very well-defined energy and that are spin polarized to provide stringent tests of theory calculations that consider spin-dependent effects in such fundamental collisions. Improved sources of polarized electrons are also being developed that use multiphoton ionization of sharp metallic tips or chiral metallic nanostructures to give the photoemitted electrons a preferential spin direction. This research on polarized electron technology holds the promise of providing new high resolution analytical tools that can be used for biological and materials research, and for industry. The experiments involving collisions between polarized electrons and chiral molecules will extend previous work that showed chiral effects with halocamphor targets. The goal is to now demonstrate such effects in molecules that have biological significance, such as selenocysteine, and to study the effect of the maximum target nuclear charge and location of the target’s chiral center on chiral scattering asymmetries. The scattering of electrons by simple atoms is well understood, but the theory for electron scattering by even the simplest molecules such as H2 is in its infancy, especially when one considers processes involving electronic excitation. The H2 experiments will focus on the energy region just above the excitation threshold for specific processes, where the theory is particularly difficult, because the excited molecule and the receding electron, which has almost no energy, interact strongly for a long time. These studies will rigorously test new theories being developed for such collisions. Ideas for novel sources of polarized electrons based on multiphoton ionization of metallic nanotips and chiral structures will be studied. The goal of this work is to make pulses of electrons that are “fast,” i.e., that have a duration comparable to that of the light pulses producing them, so they can time-resolve processes such as chemical reactions and magnetic wave motion in solids. Experiments will be done to learn if current-carrying nanostructures of tungsten can produce polarized electrons when struck by short light pulses. This work, based on the spin Hall effect, will provide a bridge between the field of spintronics and the production of free polarized electron beams.

CAREER: Emergent quantum phenomena in epitaxial thin films of topological Dirac semimetal and its heterostructures,"Nontechnical description: Topological phases of matter have attracted great attention in condensed matter physics due to their rich physics and possible revolutionary technological applications. Three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals are of great interest due to their intriguing electronic band structure and are an ideal platform to realize emergent quantum phases, dissipationless transmission of electrons, efficient generation of spin current for spintronics, and advanced quantum device concepts such as the topological field effect transistor. The goal of this research project is to explore emergent topological phenomena in a three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetal as tuned by film thickness, external electric field, and magnetic interactions. The principal investigator and research team plans to synthesize high quality epitaxial thin films of a topological Dirac semimetal candidate, Na3Bi, and its heterostructures with magnetic insulators using molecular beam epitaxy. Employing in-operando nano-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the research team plans to directly probe, with no assumptions, the complex electronic band structure that is ultimately responsible for novel phenomena in this class of quantum materials. This project plans to support the doctorate dissertation of a graduate student, through training on different experimental techniques, critical thinking and solving complex research problems. The principal investigator also plans to provide research experience for undergraduate students in her lab every summer, for multiple years from a minority serving institution. The recruitment of the undergraduate students is facilitated through the existing tie-ups with the minority serving institutions. By taking advantage of this research program, the principal investigator proposes to design and implement a new advanced lab course to provide hands-on lab experience to students on research-grade equipment. Also, the plans to develop educational initiatives for a diverse population including an outreach program targeted towards middle and high school students belonging to underrepresented minorities in southwestern Pennsylvania. Technical description: The principal investigator proposes a comprehensive research project to study emergent quantum phenomena in epitaxial thin films of a topological Dirac semimetal and its heterostructures. This research is enabled by a unique home-built ultrahigh vacuum cluster system comprising of experimental capabilities of molecular beam epitaxy, in-situ thin film patterning, and in-situ cryogenic magnetotransport, which allows the research team to synthesize and measure thin films of a topological Dirac semimetal in pristine conditions.

CAREER: Operating an Optical Atomic Clock Beyond the Laser Coherence and below the Projection Limit,"Optical atomic clocks are mankind’s most accurate metrological tool with fractional instabilities at the 10^-18 level. This corresponds to losing less than one second in the entire age of the universe. Such accuracy not only enables incredible timing precision, but also facilitates the study of phenomena that may affect the passage of time such as gravity, dark matter, and the variation of fundamental constants. Research on future generations of optical atomic clocks is focused on further improving accuracy and/or allowing a comparable accuracy to be achieved in deployed systems operating in real-world environments. This work will draw from the toolbox of quantum information science to improve the resource efficiency of optical clocks by using on-the-fly measures such as those found in quantum error correction and by using programmable entanglement generation. This research will provide undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in precision metrology and atomic quantum science. This experience, along with curricular innovations and outreach to the broader community, will help promote the growth and diversity of the American quantum workforce. The operating principle of optical clocks involves comparing a sub-Hz-linewidth laser oscillator to an ultra-narrow atomic transition to correct its frequency fluctuation and drift. The main limitations on clock performance stem from (1) the baseline stability of the laser oscillator, and (2) the atomic resources needed to correct laser frequency fluctuations whose accuracy is hampered by the projective nature of quantum measurements. This work seeks to address both issues by enabling independent operation of two atomic array optical clocks within the same apparatus and by using an optical cavity to engineer spin squeezing that mitigates projection noise. Specifically, by levering the rich atomic structure of ytterbium-171, one clock subsystem will be used for real-time correction of the laser phase during the interrogation of the other clock subsystem via ‘mid-circuit’ operations, enabling nearly a 10-times extension beyond the laser coherence time. This work merges the capabilities of neutral-atom quantum computers, optical atomic clocks, and quantum networking devices into one system. It will thus lead to advances of broad societal impact such as fault-tolerant quantum processors as well as quantum networks of optical atomic clocks that can provide quantum-secured timekeeping and the ability to search for new physics.

Jets as a Tool to Study Hadronization at RHIC and the EIC,"This award supports three separate experimental programs, each aimed at exploring the structure of our universe at the most fundamental level. The first two programs will investigate how the quarks and gluons that are liberated in high energy proton-proton and electron-proton collisions spawn new quarks and gluons that eventually combine to form the particles that comprise the visible universe. These studies will shed light on the nature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), a theory that describes the strong force, one of the three fundamental forces that are in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The third program aims to discover signals of new forces and particles that are not yet included in the Standard Model. The g-2 experiment at Fermi National Laboratory is on track to make the world’s most precise measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment (𝑎𝜇) of the muon, a particle very similar in nature to the electron, but a factor of 200 times heavier. A discrepancy between the measurement and theoretically calculated value of 𝑎𝜇 would point to possible contributions to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment from Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) forces and/or particles. The experiments supported by this grant will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the necessary tools and experience to either continue their work in basic research or to enter the technical workforce and lend their problem-solving expertise to a myriad of technical fields, including the areas of finance, big data analysis, patent law, the development and application of machine learning algorithms and medical physics. Undergraduate students funded by this award will continue to have the rare opportunity to experience the scientific culture and basic research performed at U.S. National Laboratories. The QCD program will use the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider to measure jet fragmentation functions and energy-energy correlators, from distributions of hadrons inside of fully reconstructed jets. Measurements of the differential cross-sections of identified charged hadrons within reconstructed jets in center-of-mass 200 GeV proton-proton and proton-Ion collisions will provide unique constraints on the collinear and transverse momentum dependent quark and gluon fragmentation functions and new insights into hadronization effects in nuclear matter. Measurements of energy-energy correlators in central and forward rapidity jets in proton-proton collisions at 500 GeV will giveinsights into how this hadronization process evolves in time, providing complementary information to similar measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. Finally, measurements of the Collins asymmetry in forward jets, using the newly upgraded STAR detector will provide sensitivities to the transverse spin distributions at high x as well as the Collins fragmentation functions. The BSM component of the program will allow the PI and her group to continue their current efforts in the muon g-2 experiment (E989) at Fermilab and contribute to the analysis of the final datasets (Runs 4-6).

CAREER: Detecting Quantum Signatures in Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics,"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) program in the Division of Chemistry, Melanie Reber of the University of Georgia is developing methods capable of measuring transient changes in the absorption spectra of molecules in the gas phase. Gas phase measurements, specifically in a molecular beam, allow for detailed study of the role of vibrations in excited state processes with a direct comparison to theoretical predictions. Molecular beams provide a cold and controlled environment for generating and studying small molecules but require high detection sensitivity due to the low number densities. Professor Reber and her students will use optical enhancement cavities to increase the detection sensitivity of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Their discoveries could lead to a more complete understanding of conical intersections in vibrational excited states of organic molecules and radicals. As part of the educational component, Dr. Reber will explore how the use of art and music in teaching science impacts student learning and retention of students from all backgrounds. The students involved in the project will gain highly technical training in lasers, optics, and electronics relevant to a range of high technology fields including quantum technologies. To broaden participation and awareness of the interdisciplinary fields of physical chemistry and quantum science, Dr. Reber will teach a class for incoming first-year undergraduate students to introduce them to the science, technology, and application of quantum science. The project will look at the molecular dynamics around conical intersections with both ultrafast time resolution and high spectral resolution for a detailed characterization of the dynamics. This includes the development of new instrumental techniques that study ultrafast dynamics of molecules in the gas phase with both ultrafast time resolution and high-resolution detection. The team uses ultrafast frequency comb fiber lasers in the visible and infrared spectral regions and couples them to external optical enhancement cavities to increase the signal. This enables study of dilute species in molecular beams with ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Dual comb detection techniques will be developed to provide quantum-state resolution on the absorption spectra of the resultant species. The overarching objective is to study conical intersections in excited electronic states and conical intersections between vibrational states, such as Jahn-Teller interactions. This study aims to provide a detailed description of the dynamics in the gas phase for direct comparison with theory and a more complete picture of the quantum effects in the dynamics.

New physics meets the strong force,"The aim of my research is to theoretically develop and then computationally implement methods for predicting the behavior of fundamental particles. I achieve this primarily by extending the reach of a method called lattice field theory. Lattice field theory is a specific way of defining a quantum field theory that is well-suited to numerical computations using high performance computing. Quantum field theory, in turn, is a flexible framework for the mathematical description of a wide range of physical systems. This includes a particular quantum field theory, known as the Standard Model, which is an overwhelmingly successful description of all particles and forces ever discovered.

By applying numerical lattice field theory to the Standard Model, it is possible to provide pre- and post-dictions for experiments being performed worldwide. This includes experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, such as the LHCb experiment, which recently measured the violation of a fundamental symmetry (the symmetry of mirroring particles and flipping their electric charges). My research will open the door to understanding whether this symmetry violation is hidden within the Standard Model, or is evidence for new particles and forces yet to be discovered. Similar methods can be used to explore many other results from LHCb and other experiments, such as Belle II at the SuperKEKB accelerator in Japan, which is dedicated to measuring parameters relevant to the weak force, a part of the Standard Model expected to be particularly important in the hunt for new particles and forces.

In addition to exploring the quantum field theory of the Standard Model, it is possible to define alternative quantum field theories with exotic and interesting properties that could describe observations that we know do not fit the otherwise very successful Standard Model paradigm. An impressive example in this category is dark matter, a material that is gravitationally observed to fill the known universe, but whose nature and properties otherwise remain mysterious. Experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XENON, and PandaX are dedicated to the direct detection of dark matter particles. I am collaborating on lattice field theory calculations that will be useful both for interpreting the results when these experiments are successful, and for understanding the constraints that arise from non-detection with increasing sensitivity.

In addition, because numerical lattice field theory makes use of advanced numerical data analysis techniques, it benefits from and contributes to an interplay with other numerical fields. This also plays an important role in my own work. An example of this is a technique known as the Backus-Gilbert method. Originally developed for geophysics, this is an algorithm for solving so-called inverse problems, in which observed effects are used to infer underlying causes. In lattice field theory, it can be used to extract predictions for processes involving high-energy collisions that produce many particles. The specific methods I have worked on to extend the reach of this approach have potential applications beyond particle physics, for example in areas such as medical imaging for image reconstruction, and in environmental science for interpretation of seismic data.

In summary, my research makes it possible to predict and understand the behaviour fundamental particles, explores the Standard Model and theories beyond, and uncovers synergies across different branches of computational science and data analysis.",674218,2025,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Collective Quantum Thermodynamics: Quantum vs Classical,"Thermal machines like car engines, airplane turbines and household refrigerators have long been essential to our modern society. By converting heat into mechanical work or vice versa, they set cars and airplanes in motion, drive the generators that deliver electricity to our computers and cool our food, living spaces and data centers. None of these modern applications would be possible without one fundamental theory that emerged 200 years ago and has since then enabled engineers to develop more and more advanced machines: thermodynamics. Equipped with a few elementary concepts and laws, this theory lays down the basic rules that govern the performance of James Watt's 18th century steam engine and today's car engines alike.

With the next technological revolution underway in the nano and quantum world, there is now an increasing need to develop a new generation of thermal machines that operate on extremely small length-scales to propel nano-robots or cool the building blocks of quantum computers that require ultra-low working temperatures. The last decade has seen a series of landmark experiments, in which ever smaller thermal machines were realized down to the level of single atoms. Such tiny objects are no longer bound by the rules of the classical world; they can occupy two places at the same time or influence each other at a distance without direct interaction. These phenomena are manifestations of the quantum laws of motion that govern the world at atomic scales. The discipline that aims to describe thermal machines operating in this world and seeks to harness their technological potential has been called quantum thermodynamics and forms my main area of research. 

Technological applications of quantum thermal machines are still facing major conceptual and practical challenges. One of these challenges is their limited energy turnover, which is too small to match the needs of most currently envisaged applications by several orders of magnitude. The key idea underpinning my fellowship is to address this problem by harnessing the properties of collective states of matter, which emerge when large numbers of quantum objects begin to behave in a coordinated way, somewhat similar to a flock of birds. Laying the theoretical groundwork to realize new types of quantum thermal machines that exploit these phenomena to enhance their performance is the central aim of my research program. 

Building on our results so far, my team, my partners in theory and experiment and I are working on three major topics, which are connected by the theme of seeking synergies between quantum and classical physics. First, to develop the methods required to describe quantum systems hosting collective effects, we investigate classical analogues of these systems, which can be efficiently simulated with classical computers; this idea is similar to using classical water waves as models for the wave character of quantum particles. Second, with the aim of integrating collective quantum thermal machines with classical consumers of their output, we investigate how thermodynamic quantities, like the work produced by a heat engine, can be transmitted from the quantum world into the classical one. Third, to find quantitative measures for the thermodynamic advantage generated by collective quantum effects, we explore how these phenomena make it possible to overcome general trade-off relations that constrain the power, efficiency and precision of classical small-scale thermal machines such as molecular motors. 

Quantum technologies are widely expected to shape our century in a similar way as the industrial revolution changed 19th and 20th century. Collective quantum thermal machines, for the development of which we are helping to lay the conceptual foundations, have the potential of becoming the steam engines of this development. They will not move our future cars, but they might well help to run our quantum computers and encryption devices.",673720,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Research in Gravitational Physics,"This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics, including research projects in classical general relativity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The main aim of this research is to obtain a deeper understanding of the implications of Einstein's theory of general relativity for phenomena involving black holes, as well as the nature of quantum phenomena in strong gravitational fields. The research will involve the direct participation of graduate students in all aspects of the research, and it will thereby contribute to their training. The areas of research associated with this award are of considerable interest to the public, and activities will be undertaken, such as giving public lectures, that aid in the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public. The specific research topics include (i) An analysis of decoherence effects in scattering theory, including the unphysical properties of ""bare electron'' incoming states from infinity; (ii) an analysis of whether the quantum stress-energy tensor must always be singular on a Cauchy horizon, thereby enforcing strong cosmic censorship; (iii) an analysis of properties of a new definition of the entropy of a non-stationary black hole; (iv) an analysis of whether traversable wormhole solutions can exist in classical Einstein-Dirac or Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory; (v) an analysis of the gravitational spin Hall effect and the determination as to whether this is a Gaussian beam effect rather than a WKB effect; and (vi) an investigation of whether and how one can make sense of mathematically ill-posed equations that are intended to represent effective field theories for alternatives to general relativity.

Neutron scattering studies of magnetic order and spin dynamics in two-dimensional magnetic materials,"Non-technical abstract: In order to make the next generation of computers more energy efficient, new materials that can replace copper wires and silicon chips need to be discovered. One class of candidate materials are those envisioned to constitute spin-based electronic or ""spintronic"" devices. This project studies spin and lattice properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials potentially relevant for spintronics applications. The research team uses a highly technical experimental capability available at national labs to shoot neutrons at materials and detect the quanta of energy and momenta absorbed, a process called neutron scattering. Because neutrons do not have a charge but carry spin, the way that they scatter provides unprecedented insight into magnetic properties of materials. In addition to potential technological applications, the project provides deeper insight into the fundamental nature of magnetism in condensed matter systems. Broader impacts of this program will include training of graduate students, particularly women and historically under-represented minorities, and hosting undergraduate and high school students during the summer. Technical abstract: Two dimensional (2D) magnetism plays an important role in many exotic condensed matter phenomena like quantum spin liquids, anyons, topological magnetic excitations, and high-temperature superconductivity. For both fundamental understanding and practical applications of 2D magnetism, it is important to determine magnetic orders and interactions that govern the ground states and spin dynamics of these materials. This project involves an innovative experimental program that integrates national lab based neutron scattering experiments with single crystal synthesis and characterization at the principle investigator's lab to gain a fundamental understanding of the charge, spin, and lattice interactions in bulk 2D honeycomb and kagome lattice structure magnetic materials. The project provides training of young scientists at the graduate and post-graduate levels, strategically coupled with a concentrated under-represented minority recruitment component created with collaborators at Prairie View A&M University.

CAREER: Analog Quantum Simulation of Quasicrystalline Topological Quantum Materials with Ultracold Atoms in Optical Quasicrystal Lattice Potentials,"This CAREER project aims to explore how mathematical ideas from geometry and topology combine with quantum mechanics to affect properties of quasicrystalline materials. All materials require quantum mechanics to explain their basic properties. However, “quantum materials” are a subset of materials that exhibit macroscopically observable quantum effects. Topology in materials refers to a mathematical property that remains unchanged when a material is distorted. The discovery of topological phases of matter has been an eye-opening breakthrough in condensed matter physics and has led to surprises in possible phases of matter and in the behavior of electrons flowing through materials. Geometry is important for describing crystal symmetries and it places constraints on the behavior of materials, depending on the specific symmetries at play. Altogether, topological quantum materials (TQMs) are materials for which quantum mechanics, geometry and topology are important for describing emergent material properties. The research this CAREER award enables has high synergy with ongoing experimental and theoretical efforts across atomic physics, condensed matter physics, chemistry and beyond. This CAREER project will use atomic physics techniques to build and probe an experimental analogue of a quasicrystalline material with unusual symmetries. This research team will build an experiment that traps atoms in dynamically reconfigurable and aperiodic grids of light; here, the atoms are analogous to electrons in a material, and the light grid is analogous to the underlying patterns of atoms in a material. They will observe the behavior of atoms moving around the light grid and take measurements that provide detailed information on how geometry and topology play a role in the analogue quasicrystal. This research also aims to support the internationally impactful work of BlackInPhysics (BIP) in its capacity to honor and empower physicists, as well as to provide a variety of new educational opportunities for students to learn about the scientific and technical aspects of cutting-edge research in physics. BIP will continue to generate impactful community-based programming that supports physicists and continue to develop high-visibility role models for Black youth and engage millions around the world. Separate from BIP, this research group is developing educational opportunities for a diverse group of over 1,000 young local students, which will engage the students with cutting-edge quantum science from their laboratory. This CAREER project will experimentally explore the physics of quasicrystalline quantum materials by mimicking these materials with quantum degenerate matter in optical lattices. A quasicrystal is an aperiodic crystal with rotational symmetries that are mathematically forbidden in periodic crystals. The standard mathematical analysis techniques used to understand the behavior of periodic crystals does not work for quasicrystals due to a lack of translation symmetry. Quasicrystals exhibit anomalous and, potentially, topological transport properties that are thus difficult to understand analytically. This project aims to experimentally probe the effects of geometry and topology in the quantum behavior of a quasicrystal and how these effects lead to unusual transport properties in quasicrystals. New experimental techniques developed during this project are poised to open a new class of experimental probes of quasicrystalline material properties and of atomic physics systems. These experiments may lead to a jump in the understanding of the fundamental properties of TQMs, and the quantum many-body problem more broadly, especially for addressing scientific questions that are hard to answer with quantum many-body theory alone.

"NSF-BSF: Precision Scattering of Low-Energy Muons, Electrons, and Pions with MUSE","This award provides funding for the PI and his group at Hampton University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Virginia, USA to collaborate on a high precision experiment to measure the proton’s charge radius. The experiment is called the Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) and is in progress at Paul-Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. The size of the proton is a fundamental quantity with considerable uncertainty due to conflicting measurements by various methods. The MUSE experiment will measure the proton charge radius via lepton-proton elastic scattering, and it will compare the interactions of muons and electrons of either charge with the proton at a fundamental level. The experiment will severely constrain possible explanations of the conflicting results and has the potential to reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. The project offers high-profile opportunities for students and postdocs at a minority serving institution at the forefront of international nuclear and particle physics research. The MUSE experiment is underway to provide key insight in the quest to explain the so-called proton radius puzzle - the over five-standard deviation discrepancy between proton charge radius measurements with electronic and muonic probes, respectively. Despite recent progress reported by spectroscopy and scattering experiments, the puzzle is not nearly resolved but highlights the importance of systematic uncertainties. Possible explanations of the puzzle also include new physics beyond the Standard Model. The MUSE experiment aims to address one of the most pressing questions in nuclear and particle science to date. MUSE uses mixed muon and electron beams of either charge (μ+/e+, μ−/e−) to make precise measurements of the lepton-proton elastic scattering cross sections and proton form factors over a broad kinematic range, with the goal to extract the proton charge radius for each probe. It will determine with the highest precision, model independently and conclusively, if there is any proton charge radius difference observed in electron versus muon scattering. At the same time, it will determine the role of two-photon exchange and provide tight constraints on theory. The group supported by this award plays a major role in data collection and analysis. It is responsible for the high-resolution beam particle tracking with GEM detectors, in a way not done before at low beam energies. The tracker is exposed to high rate density and beam flux, and needs to operate efficiently at a trigger rate of a few kHz.

CAREER: Directed Molecular Design of Chromophore-Radical Dyads for Optical Pumping of Doublet Ground States,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and partial co-funding from the Chemical Mechanism, Function, and Properties Program, Dr. Claudia E. Avalos and her group at New York University are designing and characterizing molecules intended for applications in quantum sensing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal enhancement. Molecules that can be classified as good quantum spin sensors often exhibit properties that also make them good candidates for NMR signal enhancement. In both cases, the molecule’s spin state should be readily controlled by the application of some form of electromagnetic radiation. Using a combination of computational and experimental techniques, the Avalos lab is seeking to identify the magnetic and structural motifs that facilitate optically induced spin control. Identification of classes of molecules that exhibit these properties would have a significant impact on improving the performance of magnetic resonance methods (which are widely used in chemical industry) and quantum sensor designs (with applications such as gyroscopes, magnetic field detection, and nanothermometry). Dr. Avalos is also engaged in educational activities involving magnetic resonance methods at both the local and national level through workshops that aim to help educators explain and incorporate magnetic resonance tools into their physics and chemistry curriculum at the high school and undergraduate level. The ability to optically generate highly polarized nuclear spin states with chromophore-radical (C-R) dyads has the potential to enable highly sensitive multi-dimensional NMR with sample-limited systems without the need for cryogens or expensive microwave sources. Given the vast chemical space that is possible in C-R systems, combined computational and experimental studies are vital to aid in the rational design of C-R molecules with desired electronic and spin properties. Dr. Avalos is seeking to determine how the C-R structure is correlated with the mechanism of polarization of the radical as well as how this structure affects the polarization transfer mechanism to neighboring nuclear spins. Improved understanding of the relationship between mechanism and structure should facilitate design of molecules with desirable magnitude and sign of the spin polarization generated as well as provide guidance for the magnetic field and temperature conditions where polarization may be accessed. The dominant mechanisms rely on an interplay of spin-spin coupling, magnetic anisotropy, orbital overlap, and sources of spin relaxation.

CAREER: Nonlinear Dynamics of Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Metal Halides Probed by Quantum-Optical Methods,"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) program in the Division of Chemistry, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada of Wake Forest University is incorporating quantum-optical principles into ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy to investigate photo-excitation dynamics in materials close to the single-photon excitation limit. Nonlinear optical spectroscopy, which is widely used to explore light-matter interactions, requires high light intensities due to fundamental limitations in classical optical detection. Unfortunately, this often introduces significant ambiguity in the derived photophysical models. This research project seeks to overcome this limitation by harnessing the superior signal-to-noise ratio provided by quantum-optical methods. Dr. Srimath Kandada and his students will use this enhanced experimental capability to investigate the unique exciton physics of two-dimensional derivatives of metal halide perovskites. Improved comprehension of perovskite photophysics is expected to drive the optimization of their optoelectronic properties, with potential benefits for a variety of applications. The education and outreach program, centered on the optics and spectroscopy components of the research program, will build a synergistic partnership between the students and faculty at Wake Forest University and the local high schools to motivate greater participation of students from diverse backgrounds in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and research. This research project aims to measure the dynamics of exciton-lattice correlations and the fluctuations that drive them, to accurately estimate the intrinsic dephasing rate of excitons and inter-exciton interactions and to measure the dynamics of carrier thermalization and exciton formation without many-body contributions. The first part of the project will focus on the nature of polaronic coupling of photo-excitations in two-dimensional metal halides and the role of dynamic lattice fluctuations. The experiment involves the measurement of noise in the amplitude and phase of the transient optical response in the presence of an impulsively generated population of coherent phonons. This will enable the estimation of contributions from stochastic lattice fluctuations to the phonon anharmonicity and polaronic dressing of excitons. The second part of the project will employ quantum-entangled photons as a probe of many-body exciton dynamics. The energy correlations between a pair of spectrally entangled photons, transmitted through the resonant medium, is to be used to accurately estimate exciton dephasing rate and biexciton interactions, bereft of multi-order expansion issues. The photon entanglement is also to be exploited to measure the population dynamics of excitons at extremely low excitation densities in a (classical) pump - (quantum) probe experiment.

Molecular Beams Studies of Cold Chemistry and Cold Stereodynamics,"We will be using our merged-beam technology to study prototypical gas-phase energy transfer reactions with full control of all translational and orientational degrees of freedom. The merged-beam method has been demonstrated in the past to permit the preparation of reaction conditions at energies as low as 10 mK. In the past years we have extended the technology by combining it with possibilities to orient paramagnetic reactants and polar molecules, and this is at the core of the present proposal. While all our target reactions to date included an atom with a large amount of internal energy, we here describe our plans to also extend this to ground-state systems.Specifically, the main targets of the present proposal are:1. Cold Chemistry reaction of Ne(3P2) with oriented ammonia molecules,2. Cold Chemistry of Ne(3P2) with oriented water molecules, and3. Low-energy chemi-ionisation reactions of Oxygen atoms with Sm atoms.Projects 1 and 2 will target reactions between metastable neon atoms in the 3P2 state and oriented polar molecules. The neon atoms will be prepared as before, using a supersonic expansion combined with a dielectric barrier discharge and guided through a magnetic guide. Oriented polar molecules will be obtained by injecting a seeded supersonic expansion into a curved electrostatic hexapole guide. Inside the guide the molecules are confined through the Stark force generated by the strong inhomogeneous electric fields interacting with the electric dipole moment of the molecules. This confines those molecules in low-field seeking states, while defocussing and ejecting high-field seeking states. As a consequence, the sample of polar molecules emerging from the guide will be polarised and can be oriented in a homogeneous electric field, as demonstrated above.Project 3 will extend our previous studies on cold energy-transfer reactions to reactions between two ground state particles. In all previous studies, one of the reactants was in a metastable state with a large amount of internal energy. Even though the translational energy was close to zero, the total amount of energy available was normally more than 15 eV. We will here extend these studies to chemi-ionisation reactions of ground state systems, in particular reactions between O(3P) and Sm atoms. Because the ground state of the OX+ ion (where X=Lantanide) energetically lies below the neutral reactants, these collisions proceed according toO + X -> OX+.The reaction is believed to be barrier-less and exoergic and is thus an ideal system to study also at low collision energies. Our apparatus is ideally suited to perform crossed- and merged-beam studies on this reaction and investigate the low-energy chemistry of a reaction that not only has very low translational energy available, but also no internal energy. Furthermore, the ground state of several of the lanthanides of interests is paramagnetic, thus, given the right conditions, also allowing for state-selection of the secondary reactant.  The first target species will be samarium atoms.",669330,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Scattering-Amplitude for Multi-Particle Processes at the LHC,"Scattering amplitudes are central objects in field theory which yield observables for many types of collision processes.In this project we aim to advance the methods for computing scattering amplitudes in field theory and their availability for applications in particle physics phenomenology at the LHC. The project has the following specific aims:1) Provide methods and software for the computation of multi-loop and multi-parameter Feynman integrals and amplitudes in field theory;2) Contribute cutting-edge two-loop scattering amplitudes in the Standard Model (SM) for processes with vector bosons, the Higgs particle and jets;We will apply the ‘numerical unitarity framework’ which I have developed with my collaborators over the last decade. The applicability of the approach was already demonstrated in breakthrough QCD results for vector-bosons-plus-jets processes at the LHC. The numerical unitarity method links physical properties of scattering processes (probability conservation and symmetry principles), exact numerical methods and methods in algebraic geometry. This approach is suitable for modern computational facilities, shows promising scaling with the complexity of the scattering process, and avoids bottlenecks in conventional analytic approaches.The amplitudes’ availability impacts particle physics and theoretical physics in the following way:1) Conceptually scattering amplitudes stand out as concise mathematical functions unifying physical principles with dynamical properties of particle theories. Advancing the mathematical understanding of amplitudes will change the way we compute and the precision we can reach.2) The broad availability of scattering amplitudes will be important for interpreting the latest data from the LHC experiments. With increasing data sets anomalous deviations from the SM (in multiple channels) are expected. Finding a fundamental explanation of the signals will depend on precision cross-section predictions which we aim to contribute. The envisaged high-multiplicity final-state configurations provide an important handle to probe the interactions’ kinematic dependences and the coupling structure of multiple heavy particles.This project is timely, due to the expected large data sets from the upcoming physics runs of the LHC and the high-luminosity phase on the long run.",664803,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Identifying Elusive Particles and Interactions with Cosmology and Colliders,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Antonio Delgado, Adam Martin, and Yuhsin Tsai at the University of Notre Dame. Particle physics today has an abundance of data from colliders, dark matter detectors, and cosmological measurements. The primary goal of phenomenologists is to scour this wealth of information for signs of new physics, especially particles that are either too heavy to produce in large quantities at colliders or that interact only weakly with the Standard Model. Under this grant, the Notre Dame group will explore new physics through various approaches. They will use cosmological data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and study Effective Field Theory, which connects experimental data to new physics phenomena in a way consistent with the symmetries and rules of nature. Through these efforts, the proposed research advances national interests by promoting scientific progress towards understanding the fundamental laws of nature. Furthermore, this research will have a broad impact by guiding future experimental searches and involving close collaboration with experimenters at Notre Dame, Fermilab, and CERN. In addition to this research, Delgado, Martin, and Tsai will continue their teaching (at both graduate and undergraduate levels), outreach efforts through the QuarkNet program, and the organization of domestic and international conferences. More technically, Prof. Tsai will use cosmological data to study strong phase transitions occurring in the late-time universe and measure the lifetime of Standard Model neutrinos. Prof. Martin and Prof. Tsai will also investigate cosmological heavy particle production, focusing on localized signals in the CMB and LSS. Prof. Martin will work on improving Standard Model effective field theory-based searches for new phenomena, emphasizing uncertainties from higher-order terms. Additionally, Prof. Martin and Prof. Delgado will study supersymmetric Effective Field Theories using on-shell amplitude methods.

Wide Searches for Gravitational Wave Sources with LIGO detectors,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity, are the ripples in the fabric of space-time created by relativistic astrophysical systems. In 2015 the NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) made the first direct observation of gravitational waves confirming the major prediction of General Relativity and opening an unprecedented new window into the cosmos. This new observational channel probes the most unusual astrophysical objects in the Universe and promises to discover new and possibly unexpected astrophysical phenomena. In the next few years, hundreds of detections of GW sources are expected as LIGO reaches its design sensitivity and the other instruments join the worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors. Even higher detection rates are expected when the LIGO is fully upgraded to its A+ configuration. These experiments will address the key research questions including the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars, the role of compact objects in high energy emission, the properties of nuclear matter, the nature of gamma-ray bursts, and probe the structure and evolution of the Universe, and, possibly, physics beyond General Relativity. This award promotes science targeting observations of gravitational waves for a wide range of astrophysical systems, and the discovery of new GW sources. This award enhances the broader effort on education and training and provides unique educational and research opportunities for students and junior scientists. This award reinforces the success of the LIGO data analysis effort at the University of Florida and supports new innovative research projects that have the potential to produce transforming results. It targets the most extreme astrophysical events, such as recently discovered mergers of neutron stars and black holes and holds promise for discoveries of entirely new astrophysical objects. The GW searches supported by the award utilize detection and reconstruction algorithms, that use minimal model assumptions. They are capable of detecting GW signals in a wide range of source parameters, including yet unknown sources. Among the primary detection targets are the Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBH), dynamic binary black hole mergers, and core-collapse supernovae, whose observations will address many open questions in astrophysics. The project activities extend the most promising GW searches for compact binary sources into the binary parameter space not yet explored by the existing template algorithms. Searches supported by the award have the potential to study IMBH sources, constrain the pair-instability mass gap, look inside the galactic nuclei by detecting dynamic binaries, and test the theory of general relativity at the high field regime by comparing the reconstructed signal waveforms with the numerical relativity predictions. Rapid source reconstruction and sky localization promote joint observations with electromagnetic telescopes and neutrino detectors advancing the field of multi-messenger astronomy.

Theory and application of Berry phase methods in solids,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY An improved understanding of the electronic properties of materials is fundamental to the development of many modern technologies, especially those relying on electronic, magnetic, and optical materials. In recent years, a class of mathematical methods based on so-called ""Berry phases"" and related topological concepts have begun having a profound impact on our understanding of the electronic structure of materials and on our ability to compute their properties. This research project is focused on the translation of these mathematical concepts into practical tools for the computation of important properties of materials, including materials whose electronic configuration shows unconventional topological behavior. Part of the project focuses on a better understanding of the underlying theory, together with the development of new or improved computer codes that embody these mathematical methods. Another part of the work involves the application of these mathematical and computational tools to improve our understanding of known materials and to assist in the search for new materials with improved properties. The research is expected to advance the availability of materials with useful electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. The project involves training and mentorship of graduate students that will contribute to their career advancement and to the development of scientific workforce, while algorithms and computer codes developed by the project will be made available in open-source form for the benefit of the wider scientific research community. The project also holds out promise for the identification and evaluation of electronic materials that may ultimately find commercial applications. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This project is focused on theoretical research on the electronic properties of materials, with a special emphasis on physical properties whose underlying mathematical description involves geometric quantities based on Berry phases and curvatures. These are typically properties for which macroscopic orbital currents play an important role, and include electric polarization, orbital magnetization, anomalous Hall conductivity, circular and gyrotropic optical effects, and the subtle role of magnetism on lattice dynamics. The proper mathematical description of these properties underlies much recent progress in the theory of topological insulator and semimetal phases and of moire-scale multilayer systems that have been the focus of recent attention. The objectives of this project are: i) to further develop the formal theory of the aspects of electronic structure that depend upon a description in terms of geometric quantities; ii) to invent and disseminate accurate and efficient computational methods for computing materials properties related to these mathematical concepts; and iii) to use computational methods to identify promising new materials or structures in which these properties can manifest themselves, potentially leading to technological applications. The need to understand the relations between bulk and surface properties requires further progress in our ability to describe geometrical properties locally, not just globally, motivating further progress in the theory of ""local markers"" and related approaches. It is timely to extend theories developed for static systems to include frequency dependence, especially regarding ordinary and spatial-dispersive optical effects that occur in low-symmetry (e.g., chiral magnetic) materials. The influence of electronic Berry phases and curvatures on the dynamics of phonons in spin-orbit coupled magnetic materials will also be explored. As a cross-cutting theme, first-principles calculations will be carried out to quantify the physical properties that are predicted on the basis of the newly developed formal descriptions, with an eye towards identifying novel materials showing unusual or enhanced properties. The project is expected to result in the development of algorithms that will ultimately be implemented in open-source code packages and made available to the wider electronic-structure community. Training and mentorship of the graduate students will contribute to scientific workforce development. The project also holds out promise for the identification and evaluation of electronic materials that may ultimately find commercial applications.

"Investigating the connection between tunneling two-level systems, ultrastability, and ideality in vapor-deposited amorphous films through controlling disorder and fragility","Non-Technical Abstract Amorphous materials, also known as glasses, lack structural order, making it difficult to calculate and predict their properties compared to crystalline materials which consist of repeated patterns of atoms. This lack of order, however, does not preclude the applicability or scientific impact of amorphous materials; plastics, silicate glasses, and amorphous silicon photovoltaics are examples pertinent to daily life, industry, and technologies, and superconducting amorphous materials changed how we understand superconductivity. Intriguingly, there exists the notion of an ""ideal glass"", which while remaining disordered, lacks imperfections in that disorder and thus approaches the uniqueness of a crystal, including reproducibility and predictability of its properties. While glasses are traditionally made by liquid quenching, in recent years materials made as thin films by vapor deposition can, under select circumstances, come closer to the ideal glass state than any liquid quenched material. This result is important to understand both because it reveals a hidden order within the structural disorder of a glass and because these glasses without imperfections have properties that are more desirable than the traditional glass. The project will fabricate and measure a class of semiconductor alloys known as chalcogenides that are important to several technologies particularly opto-electronic switches and memories, and potentially for superconducting qubits and coatings for gravitational wave detectors. By varying their composition and growth conditions and studying their structure and properties, the research team will determine how the degree of order affects the properties. The research enables understanding and control of the properties of technologically important amorphous materials and increases our understanding of the fundamental science of amorphous materials, which remains elusive despite decades of study. The project also educates and trains students and helps to increase diversity participation in science; the principal investigator and her students actively engage in efforts to make physics accessible to underrepresented STEM ethnic and socioeconomic minorities. Technical Abstract Researchers prepare and study the structure and tunneling two-level states (TLS) of amorphous chalcogenide alloys with a designed range of compositions grown by physical vapor deposition at temperatures below but near their respective glass transition temperatures under conditions that cause them to lie on a range of thermodynamic and kinetic stability, reflecting a range of enthalpy and entropy. The alloys are phase change materials important to technology including opto-electronic switches and memories, and potentially superconducting qubits and gravitational wave detector mirror coatings. Recent experiments suggest that two extremely different vapor deposited materials (indomethacin and silicon) can form ultrastable glasses with enthalpy near the corresponding crystal and with a low density of TLS, suggestive that these materials are close to ideal glasses, in which the entropy of the glass is very close to that of a crystal, indicating hidden order within their disorder. The research tests the hypothesis that low TLS is achieved by vapor deposition when growth is done near the Kauzmann temperature TK, at which the ideal glass is theoretically produced, if there is sufficient surface atomic mobility at that temperature. The distinction between fragile and strong glass formers is hypothesized to be critical: TK is high for fragile glasses, meaning that high surface mobility is likely near TK, so they grow in a low entropy, near-ideal state, whereas for strong glasses, the opposite is true. The chalcogenides range from fragile to strong as a function of composition, enabling testing of these hypotheses and creation of near-ideal low TLS glasses, providing insight into the intriguing ideal glass state.

CAREER: The Most Ancient Stars in the Milky Way,"The first stars in the Universe—the so-called Population III stars—were made up of only the products of Big Bang nucleosynthesis: hydrogen, helium, and a sprinkling of lithium. They are theoretically predicted to have formed more than 13.4 billion years in the past. They have never been observed. Many properties of Pop III stars are highly uncertain, and resolving these uncertainties is necessary to understand the origin of the elements, the properties of the first galaxies, the reionization of the Universe, and the seeds of supermassive black holes. Two graduate students will be supported by this program to perform the large-scale data analysis, and one undergraduate student from an underrepresented minority will participate in the research each summer. In addition, the team will start a long-term, sustainable, bimonthly program of portable planetarium visits to Baltimore City Public Schools elementary/middle schools. Even with the James Webb Space Telescope it is thought to be impossible to directly study individual Pop III stars, so they must be studied indirectly through the unique elemental signature they inject into the interstellar medium during their supernovae. The ratios of the elements created depend on the Pop III initial mass function as well as their binarity, rotation, and fragmentation rates. Those elemental abundances consequently constrain the otherwise unobservable properties of Pop III stars. The project will conduct a comprehensive spectral analysis of high-resolution optical spectra to calculate the photospheric stellar parameters, detailed abundances, isochrone-derived ages, and orbits of 341 stars in the inner and outer regions of the Milky Way galaxy. The data will be used to explore the Pop III initial mass function and its role in the origin of the elements, the properties of the first galaxies, the reionization of the Universe, and the origin of supermassive black holes. The chemodynamic analysis of the phase-space of an unbiased solar neighborhood sample will explore the first stage of Milky Way formation and reveal the galactic origin of metal-poor stars. Results from this project will determine whether metal-poor stars formed in the Milky Way or in accreted dwarf galaxies.

Collaborative Research: A reliable electro-optic astrocomb with 350-1000 nm coverage enabled by nonlinear nanophotonics,"While the discovery of exoplanets was one of humanity's longest-awaited scientific achievements, there remain outstanding goals: (1) the advancement of our knowledge of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, and (2) the discovery and characterization of habitable planets. This technology program directly addresses these important goals by providing new astronomical instrumentation lay the groundwork for the detection of Earth-like planets. A key missing technology is a wavelength calibration light source in the blue-visible region of the spectrum. This project will provide this technology by designing a new mechanism to produce a visible and near-ultraviolet calibration system called a laser frequency comb. The investigators will evaluate the reliability of this calibration system over extended timescales, which will be critical to the improved robustness, cost and efficiency. This system will be used with the Keck Planet Finder instrument. Exciting updates from this work will be used for public outreach, education and inclusivity activities. A laser frequency comb (LFC) has intrinsic properties that make it an ideal calibration source for radial velocity spectroscopy with precision better than 10 cm/s. The full potential of the LFC has not been realized for astronomical applications because of its limited spectral extent into the visible and near ultraviolet, generally poor reliability that requires regular maintenance, and high cost. This research will address these challenges by developing a new nonlinear nanophotonic waveguide technology based on poled thin-film lithium niobate. The lithium niobate platform provides the advantage of chi-squared nonlinear interactions in domain-engineered waveguides that enable the generation of light in the critical 350-500 nm spectral band with 10-100 times the efficiency over existing silica fibers. Indeed, starting with a narrowband comb at 1550 nm, the full wavelength coverage will extend from 350 nm to beyond 2000 nm. In addition to the long-term goal of detecting Earth-analogs, LFC-quality calibration in the blue (<500 nm) will help deliver the masses of Earth-size planets from Kepler (whose radii are known), yielding valuable bulk density measurements, expand our ability to understand internal structures of cool stars via precision Doppler asteroseismic measurements, and help shed light on the enigmatic population of super-Earths and sub-Neptune-size planets that require precise masses to constrain compositions. Moreover, this cross-disciplinary work will provide training the next generation of instrumentation scientists and engineers.

Novel Data-Driven Models for robust and generalisable ultra-low-dose PET image reconstruction and high-quality CT-free PET image synthesis,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used for diagnosing diseases such as cancer, heart conditions, and brain disorders. PET/CT scans provide highly accurate images, but they expose patients to radiation from the injected tracers and the CT scan itself. To reduce radiation risks, it is possible to decrease the dose of tracers and adjust CT settings, but this often lowers image quality, which can hinder medical diagnosis by adding noise and artifacts.This project aims to develop innovative data-driven approaches, specifically deep learning models, to enhance PET/CT imaging. The goal is to create methods that reduce radiation exposure and scanning time while maintaining high-quality images for accurate medical diagnosis. The project focuses on three key areas: 1. Improving low-dose PET scans by reducing noise and enhancing image quality.2. Exploring ways to improve PET scans without needing additional information from CT scans, potentially reducing radiation and costs.3. Studying how to use deep learning models to create PET and CT scans from low-dose PET data, preserving diagnostic accuracy.By improving PET scan safety and reducing costs, this research could lead to broader use of PET imaging in clinical practice, benefiting patients by offering more personalized and less invasive diagnostic options. The ultimate goal is to make PET imaging safer, more accessible, and cost-effective for wider adoption in medical diagnosis.",653030,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; United Kingdom; Switzerland,Switzerland,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
CAREER: Interacting Topological Bands in Moire Superlattices and Beyond,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY Quantum materials research is central to technological advancements. From the band theory of solids and its role in the semiconductor revolution to contemporary innovations such as quantum computers, advances in the theoretical understanding of quantum materials have been pivotal in shaping technological progress. Such an understanding hinges on establishing a connection between microscopic properties of materials and their emergent macroscopic behavior. The PI aims to leverage recent advances in the realization of engineered moiré materials with tunable properties to explore such connection. The proposed research aims to establish links between the motion of a single electron on the microscopic scale, characterized by the topology and geometry of electron trajectories and their interaction with complex materials lattice patterns, and the macroscopic behavior of large swarms of interacting electrons in the same platform. Since the properties of single electrons are simpler to study and easier to control, this provides a pathway to engineering the macroscopic properties of materials, potentially leading to the realization of novel phases of matter or those with enhanced properties for various applications. The PI’s proposed education and outreach plan aims to address a significant knowledge gap in the public’s perception of quantum materials research. The goal is to inform and inspire high-school students to pursue careers in quantum materials research by engaging with Boston area high-schools. These efforts will target a broad audience including underrepresented minorities and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Additionally, the PI’s outreach efforts will disseminate knowledge about quantum materials research to a broader audience through the development of online materials that simplify advanced concepts and relate them to everyday experiences. Furthermore, the PI will develop a graduate course to help prepare the next generation of graduate students for research in the field of quantum materials research. TECHNICAL SUMMARY The research project centers on exploring the profound implications of band topology on strong interactions in complex material systems, with a particular emphasis on two-dimensional moiré platforms. The primary scientific problem addressed is the relationship between single-particle characteristics, such as quantum geometry of the electron wavefunctions and the configurational layout of moiré superlattices, and the emergent properties of the system under strong electron interactions. The project is structured around three main objectives. First, the project will investigate the influence of quantum geometry on the formation and dynamics of exotic quasiparticles in interacting topological bands. These quasiparticles, such as skyrmions and anyons, arise from complex wavefunction structures unique to these systems, leading to new potential states of matter with applications in future technologies. Second, the project will develop a framework for understanding topological band theory within quasicrystals, leveraging recent advances in creating moiré quasicrystals. This involves extending traditional topological concepts to quasicrystals, aiming to discover novel topological responses and strong correlation effects. Lastly, the project will seek innovative ways to realize time-reversal symmetric topological phases by exploiting intervalley coupling in moiré systems. While most studies of fractional topological phases have focused on cases where time-reversal symmetry is broken, either explicitly or spontaneously, this research will explore conditions under which time-reversal symmetric fractional topological phases can be realized. The PI’s proposed education and outreach plan aims to address a significant knowledge gap in the public’s perception of quantum materials research. The goal is to inform and inspire high-school students to pursue careers in quantum materials research by engaging with Boston area high-schools.

CAREER: Many-Body Green's Function Framework for Materials Spectroscopy,"With support from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Tianyu Zhu of Yale University is developing high accuracy theoretical methods for simulating spectroscopic properties of solid state materials. Computational modeling of how light interacts with materials is important for advancing technological applications in optoelectronics design, solar energy conversion, catalysis, and in semiconductor development. However, current computational tools have limited accuracy and efficiency for investigating large scale many-electron materials, hindering our capability to tune and control their electronic properties and chemical reactivity. Dr. Zhu and his group will develop and leverage new ideas in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and data science, to create a reliable and efficient toolbox for modeling light-matter interactions in complex materials. These new methods will be incorporated into the open-source PySCF software package to benefit the broader scientific community. Through this program, Dr. Zhu and his team will develop a hands-on computer game demonstration of organic light-emitting materials design through Yale University’s outreach programs for K-12 students. He will also create a summer computational chemistry workshop and summer research internships targeting underrepresented high school students, as well as organize a guest lecture series to demystify computational chemistry for undergraduate students in chemistry. This research is directed at developing a workable many body Green’s function based on electronic structure methods for simulating charged and excitonic excitations in condensed matter systems, which is crucial for understanding electron correlation physics and energy transfer dynamics in materials. Dr. Zhu and his team will formulate a Green’s function quantum embedding method that enables the use of correlated excited state quantum chemistry tools in simulating photoemission spectra of extended systems, such as at the level of coupled cluster and multi-reference theories. A two particle extension of this method will be further developed to capture electron-hole interactions in describing optical spectra. In addition, the Zhu group will develop a machine learning approach to enable highly efficient, many body Green’s function calculations of molecules and materials. Adopting the established framework, systematic benchmarks on the accuracy of excited-state quantum chemistry methods in predicting valence excitations in weakly and strongly correlated electron materials will be pursued.

WoU-MMA: Gamma-ray astrophysics with the upgraded Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope,"Extreme phenomena throughout the Universe can produce photons trillions of times more energetic than the human eye can detect. Gamma-ray astrophysics is an essential component of time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics, providing the most important link from neutrinos and gravitational waves to the electromagnetic spectrum and thereby unlocking the scientific potential of the new messengers. Gamma rays enable robust identification of the sources of these multi-messenger signals. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international project in development to detect very-high-energy gamma rays with excellent sensitivity. An innovative telescope and camera design led by United States CTAO groups, the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), promises excellent performance in measuring these very-high-energy gamma rays. The prototype SCT located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona is currently being upgraded. The present project will develop data acquisition and analysis procedures to exploit the full scientific capabilities of the SCT to measure astrophysical particle accelerators that are likely sources of neutrinos and gravitational waves. The team leads the Distributed Electronic Cosmic-ray Observatory (DECO), a project that enables citizen scientists around the world to use their cell phones to detect cosmic rays and other energetic particles. DECO users span 46 states, 80 countries, and seven continents. This research takes full advantage of the newly upgraded prototype SCT, a dual-mirror imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope located next to the VERITAS array of four traditional single-mirror very-high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. The PI’s team and their collaborators will realize the full potential of the Schwarzschild-Couder concept, developing a path for US contributions to the CTAO. Work to be accomplished includes (1) developing optimized waveform analysis algorithms, (2) developing optimized camera image and video analysis algorithms, (3) applying these algorithms in concert with VERITAS data analysis to understand the newly discovered ultra-high-energy Galactic particle, (4) observing and analyzing the upcoming outburst by nova T Coronae Borealis and (5) leading DECO (described above).

Excellence in Research: Molecular-level Investigations on Binary Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids Mixture,"With support from the Chemical Structure and Dynamics (CSD) program in the Division of Chemistry and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Excellence in Research (HBCU-EiR) program in the Office of Integrative Activities, Professors Samrat Dutta and Kevin Riley, of Xavier University of Louisiana will study the connection between ionic liquid structures and their resulting macroscopic properties (such as viscosity and gas solubility) in mixtures. While single ionic liquids have been pursued as a promising class of environmentally friendly solvents both for industrial and laboratory practices, little is known about the behavior of mixtures of ionic liquids and how such mixing impacts their properties. Mixtures of ionic liquids possess uniquely high gas solubility as compared to their pure counterparts and can be polymerized to form interfaces for solid-state ion transport which are also influenced by their mixing ability. The team will develop unique vibrational spectroscopy probes, supported by quantum chemistry calculations, to present a molecular picture of ionic liquid mixtures, particularly from the perspective of ideality of mixing. A deeper understanding of ionic liquid solutions will enable the development of mixed solvents with predictable properties to facilitate practical applications, such as post-combustion carbon capture. The activities in the project will broaden underrepresented undergraduate scholars’ participation in the nation's STEM workforce specifically in the emerging global ionic liquid industry. The microenvironment of imidazolium-based binary ionic liquid mixtures, which are entirely made of ions, are complicated by many competitive forces including, but not limited to, Coulomb forces, hydrogen bonding, and dispersion interactions. Understanding the microenvironment of these complex solvents can enable the development of better ionic liquid mixtures with predictable properties. To this end, the research will study the microenvironment of binary mixtures of ionic liquids, examine gas-ionic liquid interactions in such mixtures under different conditions, and analyze the nature of the interphase between two ionic liquids when polymerized and laminated together in the solid state. A variety of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques will be leveraged to study these systems including two-dimensional (2D-IR) spectroscopy and infrared microscopy, along with density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposal will provide a spectroscopic tool kit via a C-D vibrational label on the imidazolium cation to interrogate the structure and dynamics of the binary ionic liquid mixture. The outcomes of this work will include methods to distinguish between ideal and non-ideal binary mixtures, insights into dissolution mechanisms of gases in binary mixtures, and evidence of migration of ions between two polymerized ionic liquids. On a broad scale, the project will provide a platform for young, underrepresented undergraduate students to be engaged in nationally competitive research, prepare them for graduate research, and provide opportunities for leadership in STEM areas.

CAREER: Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Spin-Correlated Excitons in van der Waals Magnets,"Nontechnical Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are transforming science and technology by offering exceptional physical properties not found in bulk solids. Among these, semiconducting van der Waals magnets provide unique opportunities to study and manipulate optical and magnetic phenomena. When exposed to light, these materials generate excitons—bound pairs of an electron and a positively charged hole that transport energy across the crystal. Unlike conventional excitons, those in van der Waals magnets are deeply influenced by the material’s intrinsic magnetism, enabling novel functionalities. This project examines the properties of these exotic particles, exploring their microscopic interactions and developing control strategies to achieve long-range energy transport with minimal dissipation. By employing advanced optical techniques and tailored laser pulses, this research contributes to the emerging field of 'magneto-excitonics,' where the synergistic interplay of magnetic and optical properties enables innovative applications in quantum devices, energy-efficient nanophotonics, and information processing. Complementing these research efforts, the project addresses critical challenges in STEM education, inspiring and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers. The activities engage over 30 undergraduate students and 50 K-12 educators in advanced research, fostering a pipeline of STEM professionals and cultivating sustained interest in science and technology from an early age. Strategic partnerships with Austin’s semiconductor industry ecosystem support a mentorship program impacting over 150 undergraduate students, offering valuable networking opportunities with role-model leaders and equipping participants with the knowledge and skills essential for success in the high-tech sector. These initiatives strengthen retention in STEM fields, contribute to workforce development, and bridge the gap between academia and the local semiconductor industry. Technical Abstract: Semiconducting van der Waals magnets host various classes of strongly bound excitons closely tied to the underlying spin order, showing exotic magneto-optical phenomena and high sensitivity to external stimuli. Unveiling methods to manipulate these spin-correlated excitons on ultrafast timescales is a critical goal in van der Waals materials research. Theoretical frameworks suggest that exciton properties can be dynamically tailored by engineering the magnetic or crystallographic environment out of equilibrium, and preliminary spectroscopic observations indicate that certain exciton species may exhibit coherent (i.e., wavelike) propagation over tens of picoseconds. The primary goal of this project is to gain a profound understanding of spin-correlated excitons in semiconducting van der Waals magnets by revealing their interactions with low-energy collective modes (e.g., phonons, magnons) and clarifying how exciton creation influences the underlying magnetic order. Building on these insights, the Principal Investigator aims to map the spatiotemporal propagation of these bound species and develop cutting-edge protocols—based on coherently evolving magnetic/crystal environments or optical microcavities—to enhance exciton coherence over macroscopic length scales. This research is integrated with a series of educational and outreach activities. Collaborations with UT Austin’s NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and the Texas Institute for Electronics provide undergraduate students with hands-on research opportunities and connect them to Austin’s thriving semiconductor industry ecosystem through a dedicated mentorship program. The project also engages K-12 educators by offering workshops that introduce groundbreaking scientific discoveries and equip them with innovative teaching strategies to inspire the next generation of STEM leaders.

Atoms Interlinked by Light: Programmable Interactions for Quantum Simulation and Computation,"Among the leading platforms for quantum information processing are systems of cold atoms, which marry exquisite control down to the single-atom level with scalability to large numbers of identical particles. Epitomizing these features are myriad successes in engineering entanglement – nonlocal correlations that form the backbone of quantum technologies – by controlling atoms with laser light. A particularly scalable approach is to couple many atoms to light in an optical resonator, which allows the light to convey information between arbitrary atom pairs. The PI proposes to enhance this approach with programmable connectivity and single-qubit control, by trapping an array of individual atoms in an optical resonator and employing local optical addressing to control the interactions. This new paradigm opens a path to implementing quantum algorithms for chemistry problems and simulations addressing problems in materials science that are intractable to classical computers. The project will also expand the STEM workforce, both by direct training of graduate students who will conduct the research and by supporting the Stanford Program for Inspiring the Next Generation of Women in Physics (SPINWIP), an online summer program in which undergraduate and graduate students introduce high-school girls to cutting-edge topics in quantum science. The scientific goals of the project are organized into thrusts of (1) exploring frustration and topology in programmable spin models; (2) measurement-based computation and state preparation; and (3) accessing non-Gaussianity as a resource for computation. These efforts will be enabled by the combination of non-local, light-mediated interactions with local addressing to control the graph of interactions in an atomic array. Initial experiments will operate with each array site containing an atomic spin ensemble in a regime of strong collective atom-light coupling, which provides access to Gaussian multimode entangled states. In parallel, the research team will develop a next-generation optical resonator with enhanced atom-photon coupling, in which they will trap an array of individual atoms in optical tweezers. Here, leveraging techniques of single-atom control and detection will allow for approaching a regime of quantum advantage. The project offers a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization between atomic and photonic approaches to quantum information processing, where the former offers the benefit of single-qubit nonlinearities while the latter enables programmable nonlocal connectivity.

QFTs via Cut and Paste Techniques,"This project aims to advance our understanding of (perturbative) quantum field theory (QFT) through rigorous mathematical investigation via an exploration of its intricate structures. In particular, I am interested in the behavior of field theories in the presence of boundaries and, especially, on how one can find global results via gluing different (simpler) pieces of space-time together. In addition, I will study equivalences of field theory, in particular relating topological QFTs (which are easier to study) to physical theories like Yang-Mills and gravity in four dimensions. This research fits in the current mathematical study of QFT, is based on an already very successful program, and is bound to produce novel results of general interest, like: a general approach for constructing spaces of states via cut-and-paste techniques, the realization of a symmetry algebra for general relativity located at corners, a new approach to Yang-Mills and gravity theory, including the construction of new extended observables (which would also be of independent interest in the construction of topological invariants). The main methods are mathematical tools we developed over the years stemming from the now classical approaches of Batalin-Vilkovisky and Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky for the quantization and for the homological description of reduced phase spaces of field theories, from the approach of Kijowski and Tulczyjewfor the geometrical determination of the reduced phase space of a theory, from ideas in deformation quantization, especially after Kontsevich, and from techniques on configuration spaces as developed by Axelrod and Singer, after Fulton and McPherson.",645146,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"Particle Physics, Gravity and Cosmology","This award funds the research activities of Professors John Donoghue, Ben Heidenreich, and Lorenzo Sorbo at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. One of the most pressing questions in theoretical physics concerns the search for a theory (or theories) that can unite quantum mechanics and gravity, as well as strategies to probe its validity. Professor Donoghue's and Professor Heidenreich’s research use different techniques to explore the theoretical aspects of quantum gravity: Professor Donoghue, by studying its implications at relatively low energies, and Professor Heidenreich, by determining general properties that any theory of quantum gravity should satisfy. Professor Sorbo studies how such a theory (as well as other theories) might have left observable effects during the early evolution of the Universe. This project will also have important broader impacts. Graduate students will be involved in this research, so that junior physicists can be trained to do research in this field. Profs. Donoghue, Heidenreich and Sorbo will also create online pedagogical material, organize workshops and provide outreach to grade school audiences. More technically, Professor Donoghue will investigate novel aspects of the effective field theory treatment of quantum general relativity. Professor Heidenreich will investigate quantum gravity through the swampland program, with a focus on stringent tests of foundational ideas such as the absence of global symmetries and constraints on the spectrum of particles and branes, and on the properties of moduli space. Professor Sorbo will explore various aspects of inflationary phenomenology, with a focus on processes of particle creation during inflation, especially in the regime where the created particles strongly affect the background.

Using TURBO to Resolve Shock Breakout from Supernovae and Observe Early Optical Emission from Multi-Messenger Events,"Massive stars die spectacularly as Supernovae (SN). The investigators seek to understand the processes in massive stars during their final years before exploding. The investigators will use two sets of optical telescopes in New Mexico and Crete, Greece known as the Total-Coverage Ultra-Fast Response to Binary-Mergers Observatory (TURBO) to image a small set of nearby galaxies. By taking images every several minutes, they will be able to detect the first brief pulse of light emerging from supernovae in those galaxies. These observations will probe the exploding stars’ internal structure and recent mass loss. A second objective of the program is to study the mergers of pairs of neutron stars. Such mergers emit ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves. Following an alert from a gravitational-wave observatory, TURBO will begin searching for light emitted by the merger. TURBO’s uniquely fast response of two seconds will allow it to find rapidly fading sources. Successful detections will provide insight into whether such mergers are primarily responsible for Earth’s heavy elements. The program will involve students from UMN-Morris, which serves a significant Native American student body, as well as New Mexico Tech, an Hispanic-serving institution. The project will develop the ability to stream TURBO imaging to classrooms and will use Zooniverse to involve the public. Observations of the initial pulse, or breakout of the internal shock at the surface of the SN progenitor, (4–6 each year) can be expected to connect the properties of progenitors to those of the SNe, as well as provide new insight into the structure of massive stars just before the explosion. Furthermore, the investigators expect to identify the shock breakout of the massive progenitor of a “failed SN” in a nearby galaxy. A global and growing network of gravitational-wave detectors has now observed a total of more than one-hundred mergers of compact objects. TURBO will be used to rapidly image hundreds of square degrees for counter parts of gravitational-wave events. TURBO has a unique ability to leverage LIGO’s new early warning alerts and observe mergers as they happen across large areas on the sky. It will provide targets to global follow-up facilities. With an optical counterpart, mergers will enable a measurement of the Hubble constant, addressing the current tension, in addition to the r-process yields of kilonovae.

Novel Phases and Dynamics of Molecular Condensates and Bose-Fermi Mixtures,"This project supports two lines of research: (1) chemical reactions at ultralow temperatures. While conventional reactions are driven by thermodynamics through collisions, at temperatures of ~10^{-9} Kelvin and below new forms of chemical reactions, also known as “quantum super-chemistry”, are conjectured to emerge. The proposed work will discover guiding principles of quantum super-chemistry and develop innovative ideas and applications to steer these coherent chemical reactions. (2) Pairing in condensed and nuclear matter. Impurities in magnetic materials interact through the Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) mechanism. In nuclear matter resonant pair-wise interactions are responsible for Efimov three-body bound states. This project will test an intriguing transition between the RKKY mechanism and Efimov states, predicted for quantum mixtures in the strong interaction regime. The PI will also design a 5-day science outreach program every summer for 15 underrepresented high school students from public schools in the Chicago area. In addition, an international exchange program with students from Taiwan will be initiated. The science research will be conducted on two platforms: Cs and a Li-Cs mixture. For the super-chemistry project, research on Bose-stimulated reactions in Cs and Cs2 atom-molecule condensates will provide a new understanding of reaction processes in the quantum regime. The results will offer new tools to steer coherent, state-to-state chemical reactions. For the RKKY-Efimov project, a Bose-Fermi mixture of cesium and lithium atoms will be employed near an interspecies Feshbach resonance to test the predicted connection between two-body pairing via the RKKY mechanism and three-body Efimov bound states. Confirmation of the transition will reveal the surprising link between condensed matter and nuclear physics in the strong coupling regime.

Electronic Coherence and Entangled Molecular Wave Packets,"The internal dynamics of molecules after absorbing light plays a fundamental role in many aspects of our lives, including vision, solar energy harvesting (e.g., photosynthesis and solar cells) and in the protection of DNA from ultraviolet radiation (UV photoprotection). These dynamics consist of a complicated interplay between the electrons and the nuclei, whose motions are strongly coupled and cannot be treated independently. As the dynamics are governed by the rules of quantum mechanics and involve many coupled particles, they are very difficult to calculate accurately. Furthermore, because they take place on ultrafast time scales [10^(−15) s], and on very short length scales [10^(−10) m], they are very difficult to observe and follow experimentally. In this work, the PI and graduate students carrying out the research will develop experimental approaches to follow the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and nuclei in small molecules following the absorption of light. They will use temporally shaped ultrafast pulses, and advanced charged particle detection techniques, as an ultrafast quantum camera to take “pictures” of the molecules and produce movies of the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics following the absorption of light. The work will contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists, and ties directly to the 2023 Nobel prize in physics for the development attosecond pulses and the study of electron dynamics. Octave spanning ultra-broadband laser pulses will be generated using nonlinear optical techniques (self-phase modulation in stretched hollow-core fibers) and shaped using an acousto-optic, modulator-based, frequency-domain pulse shaper. This approach to pulse shaping allows the PI and graduate students carrying out the measurements to produce pulses which are short enough to capture the dynamics as they unfold and to be sensitive to the detailed motion of the electrons. By measuring the energy and direction of electrons and ions produced by the interaction between the molecules and pairs of shaped laser pulses, the PI and graduate students can gain detailed insight into the evolution of the molecule—i.e., how the electrons and nuclei move after the molecule absorbs light. The measurements will be compared in detail with approximate calculations of the dynamics in order to develop better models and a more comprehensive understanding, which will ultimately lead to the development of improved light harvesting and energy conversion technologies.

CAREER: Atomically-Precise Single Photon Emitters,"Nontechnical Description: The ability to characterize and control matter at small length-scales is a critical capability for the advancement of technologies, specifically for technologies which harness quantum mechanical behavior. Such quantum technologies are poised to revolutionize how we transmit and process data. A key component of many quantum technologies is a special type of light emitter called a single photon emitter (SPE). One major problem facing the practical implementation of SPEs in modern technologies is the variability of performance between nominally identical SPEs. It is critical to understand and minimize these sources of variability. The research goal of this project is to develop experimental techniques based on atomic force microscope (AFM) that provide atomic-scale characterization and control, and accelerate the development of SPEs. An AFM is a tool which uses a sharp tip to mechanically interact with the sample surface. This research uses AFMs to measure and manipulate the mechanical and electronic properties of materials to understand the interplay between mechanical strain, material imperfections, and quantum behavior. This project also supports development and dissemination of training materials that teach researchers how to use advanced AFM measurements in their research. Additionally, the principal investigator develops and implements laboratory projects related to materials science and AFMs that are geared to students ranging from middle school through graduate school, with the intention of inspiring and training students in materials research. Technical Description: The goal of this project is to develop atomic force microscope (AFM) capabilities that accelerate the discovery and development of nanomaterials for applications in quantum technologies and electronics. A key component of many quantum technologies is a single photon emitter (SPE). Two-dimensional materials (2DM), such as tungsten diselenide and hexagonal boron nitride, have emerged as promising candidates for solid-state SPE hosts. However, for 2DM SPEs to become technologically viable it is essential to understand and control these materials at the atomic scale. Unfortunately, there are no experimental tools capable of simultaneously addressing the key factors of nano-scale strain, atomic defects, and interlayer effects from surrounding materials. The research goal of this proposal is to develop and use a suite of novel AFM techniques to achieve atomic-scale characterization and control of 2DM in conjunction with optical characterization to understand the fundamental origin and sources of variability in 2DM SPEs, which is a critical step toward realizing 2DM SPEs with sufficient attributes and repeatability to be useful in technologies. In contrast to prior work in this area, this research focuses on measurements at the atomic scale, which reveals heterogeneities that have not been adequately considered in the past. In addition to insights into SPE behavior, the general framework developed in this research enables 2DM researchers to obtain knowledge about strain, defects, and substrate interactions at the atomic scale, which has far-reaching impacts in the understanding of 2DM.

Nuclear Structure Studies of Medium-Mass Nuclei: from Stability to Afar,"This award focuses on obtaining a better understanding of the structure of the atomic nucleus and working towards a predictive model of the atomic nucleus as a function of proton number, neutron number, and energy. The objective of the research program is to determine properties of medium-mass nuclei (mass numbers from ~30 to ~80) and ranging from stable nuclear systems to exotic, neutron-rich nuclear systems. Each of the nuclei to be studied has predictions of exhibiting multiple shapes, long-lived nuclear states called isomers, and/or they are relevant to other rare nuclear phenomena such as neutrinoless double-beta decay or double-gamma decay. Through experimentally quantifying nuclear properties directly related to these phenomena, the research addresses the question, “How do the rich patterns observed in the structure and reactions of nuclei emerge from the interactions between neutrons and protons?”, as outlined by the broader nuclear physics community in “A New Era of Discovery: The 2023 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science.” The PI and graduate students in the group will perform experiments at US based facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, the High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source, and John D. Fox Laboratory at Florida State University, and build on the PI’s experience with experimental nuclear physics techniques and detection systems employed at each laboratory. To expand the impact of this project, an educational component will continue to offer a unique physics summer camp experience for students with autism spectrum disorder in Mississippi and many other states. By engaging students who are a part of this underserved portion of the population in physics, the opportunities of studying physics and performing research will be shown to a new generation of highly capable scholars. The objective of this project is to determine properties of excited nuclear states and their decays, such as excitation energies, lifetimes, branching ratios, and transition strengths, in medium mass nuclei ranging from stability to extremely exotic. This information is targeted for nuclei that are predicted to exhibit multiple shapes, i.e., so-called shape coexistence, and/or show effects of shell evolution caused by the emergence of effects from intruder orbitals, altered shell gaps, and cross-shell excitations. Comparisons of results with modern shell-model calculations will aid in the determination of the underlying nuclear configurations and serve as a stringent test of theoretical predictions. By studying 72Ge, 72Ga, and a host of neutron-rich nuclei approaching N = 28 and N = 50 using state of the art nuclear detection systems, a thorough approach is taken to characterizing this region of medium-mass nuclei where shape coexistence and intruder orbital effects are predicted to occur yet remain to be fully quantified. This research will also have an important impact on the education of young scientific researchers. One broader impact educational component of the NSF award is to continue to develop a physics summer camp for high-school aged students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The summer camp will offer students with ASD in Mississippi and its surrounding states an opportunity to experience physics, including nuclear physics, in a highly interactive way. The summer camp will be designed to be a comprehensive postsecondary transition program for students with ASD that will enable them to learn physics, socialization skills, and the opportunities of pursuing research projects and a STEM degree at a 4-year university. The camp has been growing since it was first hosted in 2022 and has had a huge impact on many of the students who attended the camp towards their deciding to attend a 4-year university.

CAREER: Quantum Information Theory of Many-body Physics,"In nature, systems of strongly interacting quantum mechanical particles can form a novel phase of matter in which the constituents of the system are strongly entangled with each other. While such phases can have potentially transformative applications, such as building a topologically protected fault-tolerant quantum computer, the presence of such entanglement has posed a significant challenge in our understanding, characterization, and experimental identification of such phases. The PI will address these issues by leveraging a novel theoretical framework known as the entanglement bootstrap program, which was pioneered by the PI. This theoretical framework will lead to the development of efficient methods to identify and characterize strongly entangled phases of matter in experiments and in many-body simulations on classical computers. The PI will also develop a comprehensive education and outreach plan, which includes an education and training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar. Moreover, the research activities will be disseminated in a form that is accessible to a broad set of researchers. Finally, the PI will host a bootcamp on quantum computing and quantum entanglement geared towards college students of underrepresented backgrounds near Davis, California, broadening the participation of students of diverse backgrounds to the field of quantum information science. The main scientific goal of this proposal is to develop a theoretical framework that can predict properties of strongly entangled quantum many-body systems at long wavelength from their local data, encoded in local reduced density matrices. Leveraging the recent development in the entanglement bootstrap program, the PI will make progress on the following problems. First, the PI will discover the topological invariants that can characterize many-body quantum phases. Second, the PI will develop a method to extract these topological invariants from the data that are readily available from numerical studies and experiments. Finally, by studying solutions to the quantum marginal problem, the PI will develop numerical methods to simulate and interpret low-energy properties of interacting quantum many-body systems.

Electroweak Radiative Corrections to Higgs Pair Production at the LHC,"Several relevant Higgs production and decay processes cannot be calculated analytically at higher perturbative orders with conventional methods. An alternative and often conclusive approach is provided by numerical integration methods in many cases where analytical methods will not be sufficient. There have been several different numerical methods applied to highly relevant Higgs processes at the LHC in recent times. A common feature of most of these methods is that they have to be developed for and adjusted to the particular detailed problems of the process at hand that strongly depends on the size of hierarchies between scales and masses involved and the particular structure of perturbative ultraviolet and infrared divergences. Due to this more individual nature of numerical methods a construction of a general automatized method will be very difficult. All methods developed so far reach their limitations very fast once the corresponding scale hierarchies become large. This is the reason why in this proposal the main goal is not an automatization of our methods, but much more to reach new results at higher order in perturbation theory for Higgs processes of high relevance at the LHC as has been emphasized in several international recommendation and strategy documents. This enterprise requires substantial support in terms of man power.This proposal will cover the full two-loop electroweak corrections to the production of Higgs-boson pairs via gluon fusion and a potential extension of existing calculations for the photonic and gluonic Higgs decays as well as single-Higgs production via gluon fusion. The anticipated results will be of major relevance for present runs at the LHC, the world-wide highest-energy particle collider experiment at the moment, and for the future runs at the HL-LHC. The processes addressed in this proposal rank among the flagship processes of the European Strategy document and the Chipp Roadmap to test the nature of the Higgs boson. The size of the expected radiative corrections will compete with the projections performed for the HL-LHC, i.e. the last stage of the running LHC collider so that their knowledge is of utmost importance for a reliable interpretation of the experimental results in the context of not being limited by an insufficient theoretical accuracy. However, the results will also be universal so that they will be valid for any future hadron collider at higher energies and the Higgs decay widths for future e+e- and muon colliders as well. On the other hand the theoretical methods going to be developed during this project will serve as an important ingredient in future attempts to automatize such kind of calculations at the two-loop level or even beyond in a stable way.",624543,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
GWAND: Gravitational Waves Astronomy with Next-generation Detectors,"The first observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from the merger of binary black holes celebrated the beginning of the field of GW astronomy. GW astronomy has achieved various significant milestones, such as contributing to a deeper understanding of neutron star equations of state, offering tests of general relativity (GR), independently measuring Hubble’s constant, and enhancing our knowledge of the population of black holes and neutron stars in the universe, shedding light on their formation processes.The promise of scientific exploitation of GWs motivates the design of new detectors that will ensure the development of GW astronomy in decades to come. The multi-billion funding for the construction of the third-generation ground-based detectors (Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission reflect the immense enthusiasm for GW astronomy. These advanced detectors will allow us to observe the universe in unprecedented detail and facilitate the detection of an entirely new class of compact binary sources.To realize the full scientific potential of the next-generation detectors, the development of data analysis tools is paramount to extract physical information from the data collected by these instruments. The process of parameter estimation relies entirely on the theoretical predictions of GW emission provided by waveform models. The GWAND project aims to align the development of waveform models and parameter estimation techniques with the specific needs of third-generation detectors and the LISA mission, ensuring the viability of data analysis and the delivery of robust scientific insights derived from GW observations.",622258,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
Unraveling Tunable Piezoelectricity in Hafnia-based Ferroelectrics,"Nontechnical Description Ferroelectric materials have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. They have many applications in electronic devices, such as non-volatile memories, optical filters and pressure sensors. All ferroelectrics are also piezoelectric. They change shape under an applied electric field and can also convert mechanical stress to electrical energy. Hafnia oxide ferroelectrics are unique in that their piezoelectric behavior depends on how they are made and the electrical cycling history. While these are interesting materials, the body of knowledge about hafnia piezoelectricity is largely empirical. The community lacks a fundamental understanding of precisely how such factors determine the piezoelectric properties. This project directly addresses that gap in knowledge. It brings together an interdisciplinary team to perform systematic experimental studies and theoretical modeling of the piezoelectric behavior of hafnia films with controlled microstructure. The ultimate aim is to achieve tunability of the piezoelectric response of hafnia. This in turn will enable design of the devices with enhanced electromechanical performance. The international nature of this project enhances the research, education, and outreach missions of the University of Nebraska and the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology. The project prioritizes an increase in the number, quality, and diversity of students pursuing careers in science and technology. Outreach activities to promote science literacy will help to build a culturally diverse community of scientists and educators and enrich their professional preparation and education experience. Technical Description Hafnia-based ferroelectrics are among the most actively studied groups of materials due to the vast range of fundamentally and technologically captivating properties. One of the most intriguing and unique characteristics of these materials is extremely high sensitivity of their piezoelectric properties on a variety of extrinsic factors, which causes a significant discrepancy between the theoretically predicted piezoelectric behavior and broad variations of the experimentally measured parameters. The current international collaborative project seeks to address this outstanding controversy by achieving a fundamental understanding and deterministic control of the piezoelectric properties of the hafnia-based ferroelectrics by adopting an approach based on synergy between theoretical modeling and systematic testing of the role of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the piezoelectric behavior. Experimental studies carried out both at the nanoscale and global levels using a combination of the local probe microscopy and time-resolved synchrotron measurements focus on investigation of the ferroelectric and electromechanical properties of the epitaxial, polycrystalline, and free-standing hafnia thin film capacitors as a function of thickness, composition, substrate and film microstructure as well as on evaluation of the effect of electrical cycling and mechanical strain modulation on evolution and tunability of the electromechanical properties. Theoretical studies involve first-principles modeling of the electromechanical response of thin films and free-standing membranes with the goal to assess a role of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors in piezoelectric tunability and provide guidance for the experimental studies. The project is performed in collaboration with the Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund.

Pushing the frontier of precision physics for massive multi-particle processes with differential equations and finite fields,"The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) has proven spectacularly successful at describing the subatomic world. Yet, crucial questions remain unanswered - most notably it does not incorporate gravity - and some of its properties still need to be understood. Given the current estimate for the top-quark mass, for example, we cannot establish conclusively the stability of the SM vacuum. Our most powerful probe into the subatomic world is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The first runs have led to amazing results, but we have seen only a few percent of the total data that the LHC will deliver throughout its lifespan, and improvements in systematic uncertainties mean that measurements at the percent-level precision will soon be available. The potential for new discoveries is gigantic, but exploiting it requires that we keep the theoretical and experimental uncertainties in line.Obtaining precise predictions for hadron collisions is a hard, multi-faceted problem. A fundamental ingredient are the scattering amplitudes, which encode the probability distribution of the particle scattering processes. Scattering amplitudes are computed in perturbation theory, i.e. as truncated series in the coupling constants which give the strengths of the interactions. Including more terms improves the accuracy, but the computation becomes more difficult. Reaching a percent-level precision requires going at least to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the part of the SM which describes the strong interaction. This is particularly challenging for processes involving many physical scales, which are however of great interest since the high energy of the interactions at the LHC can lead to the production of many particles. The current frontier for multi-particle NNLO computations are 2?3 scattering processes. Over the last years we have seen important progress in this direction, building upon the campaign which mastered the 2?2 processes and a deepened understanding of the polylogarithmic special functions appearing in the amplitudes. The results are however limited to 2?3 processes whose amplitudes involve only massless loop propagators. This limitation excludes many processes relevant for the LHC's programme, such as the production of a top-quark pair in association with a jet (ttj) or a Higgs boson (ttH). The former is sensitive to the top-quark mass, while the latter probes the top Yukawa coupling, both of them crucial parameters of the SM. The main bottleneck is the computation of the required two-loop five-particle amplitudes. The massive propagators lead to a sharp leap in complexity, owing to the appearance of 'non-polylogarithmic' special functions. The latter constitute a formidable challenge, as our mathematical technology to handle them is still unripe. The project will attack this issue, and deliver methods for computing two-loop multi-particle amplitudes with massive loop propagators. I will achieve these methodological goals by working on concrete examples of relevance for the LHC's programme, most importantly ttj and ttH production in proton-proton collision.The computation of the required Feynman integrals - fundamental blocks of the amplitudes - is the first and foremost challenge, which I will address with the method of differential equations (DEs). Understanding and controlling the non-polylogarithmic special functions arising from the DEs will require innovative methods, bridging the gap between physics and mathematics. To overcome this challenge I will investigate how to extend the method of the pentagon functions, which underpins the recent success with massless 2?3 processes. The algebraic complexity of the expressions of the amplitudes is also a major step up in difficulty. To tame it, I will use cutting-edge techniques based on numerical sampling over finite fields, and devise new strategies to reconstruct the analytic expression of the final results based on algebraic geometry and physical properties.Achieving these goals will boost our capability of computing theoretical predictions. Together with the improved experimental uncertainties at the LHC, this will enable a better understanding of the SM and help in the search for new physics. The deepened understanding of the non-polylogarithmic functions will be important for other branches of physics - such as string theory and general relativity - and for pure mathematics, and the results of the planned calculations will provide precious analytic data for many ongoing theoretical studies.",619389,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"Nanoscale Imaging of Quantum Scarring, Electron Guiding, and Steering in Two-Dimensional Material Heterostructures","Nontechnical abstract: This project addresses the lack of fundamental understanding of chaotic quantum phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) materials, which are a promising platform for the next generation electronics. Chaos is found everywhere in our classical world, causing havoc in various facets of our everyday lives such as long-term weather forecasts and financial market predictions. The quantum analog of chaos remains puzzling and significantly impacts electrons hosted in nanoelectronics based on 2D materials. To this end, the research team uses high precision scanning probes that can image and manipulate electrons at the atomic scale to study and harness chaotic quantum phenomena hosted in 2D materials. This experimental work is strongly supported by advanced and specialized computer-based simulations. In particular, this project focuses on two types of quantum-chaotic phenomena known as quantum scarring and superwire channeling. Quantum scarring originates from the constructive interference of electrons as they traverse nanoelectronic devices and can favor certain unstable pathways in an otherwise chaotic system. Superwire channeling consists of dynamic “wires” that gently guide electrons in patterned channels several nanometers wide, and perhaps microns or even centimeters long. The harnessing of these chaotic phenomena enables novel methods for selective and flexible delivery of electrons at the nanoscale; thus, innovating new modes of quantum control. Additionally, this project involves graduate and undergraduate student research training. Students contribute to project research activities and, in doing so, contribute to senior thesis/doctoral dissertation graduation requirements. These outcomes and their dissemination contribute to the development of a workforce that is proficient with core concepts in quantum mechanics. Technical abstract: This project seeks to enhance fundamental understanding of quantum chaotic behavior in emerging two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructure devices. This is important because chaotic behavior is ubiquitous in nature and so, such phenomena is present in 2D material heterostructure devices. A central activity of this project is the visualization, characterization, and control of quantum scarring and superwire channeling. Both phenomena were first predicted by the theory component of the research team but have yet to be experimentally realized. The research team utilizes scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum dots based on monolayer and bilayer graphene to realize and investigate quantum scarring with unprecedented spatial resolution. Numerical analysis is then employed to illuminate experimental findings and guide the control of these states via the application of electric and magnetic fields and the careful incorporation of atomic scale impurities. For superwire channeling the experimental component of the research team uses a combination of advanced nanofabrication techniques and cutting-edge scanning probe microscopies to probe the predicted zero resistivity of these states. This alluring property can be leveraged for new low power nanoelectronic devices.

CAREER: Monostructural Topological Spin-Insulatronics,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports integrated research and education endeavors to discover and understand new physics enabling electronic devices to operate efficiently without incurring undesirable waste heat. Miniaturization of electronic devices is essential to the advancement of future technology. Down to the nanometer scale, however, further progress is hurdled by the low control efficiency, soaring heat, and complexity of integration. Recent discoveries of magnetic topological materials bring about exciting opportunities to fundamentally address these problems, thanks to their unique physical characteristics. This project conducts a timely investigation in response to the pressing need for low-dissipation devices by inquiring into the microscopic physics of the emerging classes of topological materials, intending to lay a solid physical foundation for non-dissipative devices featuring a (theoretical) 100% power conversion and vanishing heat production. In addition, the project explores a transformative alternation of the conventional spin-based electronics, such that a single material unit on its own can function as both driver and oscillator, hence obviating the need to develop complex heterostructures and interfaces. These compelling properties, bolstered by the intriguing physics behind the intertwined electronic and magnetic structures, hold potential in creating disruptive technology and could even revolutionize the basic architecture of modern computers. The research project is complemented by educational activities to train both graduate and undergraduate students for theoretical research. The PI will organize a special seminar named “Condensed Matters Matter” targeting undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds to nurture their curiosity in condensed matter physics with an accessible level of introduction and an enhanced exposure to the latest discoveries. The PI will also develop a new undergraduate course on MATHEMATICA programming for solving real problems in physical sciences and engineering. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award funds theoretical research and educational activities to achieve non-dissipative spintronics using a single magnetic material which can drive itself without relying on foreign components. Traditional paradigms of electrical control of magnetism involve engineered heterostructures in which magnetic dynamics is controlled by spin angular momenta generated from charge currents outside of the magnetic material. Such a setup is extremely inefficient in serving its purpose because of the inhibited interfacial spin transfer and the inevitable Joule heating effect. The PI and his team pursue a new paradigm of spintronics based on monostructural systems (i.e., single material platforms) free of interfaces and devoid of Joule heating from a theoretical perspective. The project strives to unravel the microscopic origins of the intricate interplay between topological electrons and magnetic dynamics enabled by the spin-orbit interactions, among other relevant degrees of freedom, in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators and other exotic phases of matter. The project seeks to quantify the non-trivial spin-orbit torques driven by pure voltages, the dynamical consequences that follow, and the underlying symmetry principles. Besides establishing an in-depth understanding of the unprecedented physical behavior of monostructural spintronics, the project also seeks to make experimentally verifiable predictions and develop a theoretical toolbox for proper experimental designs. This award also supports educational activities which include mentoring graduate students and providing unique opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in real research at an early stage. In addition, the PI will organize a special seminar named “Condensed Matters Matter” targeting undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds to nurture their curiosity in condensed matter physics with an accessible level of introduction and an enhanced exposure to the latest discoveries. The PI will also develop a new course at senior undergraduate level to teach problem-solving skills in physical sciences and engineering using MATHEMATICA software.

"Anomalies, String Vacua and the Swampland","This award funds the research activities of Professors Katrin Becker and Ergin Sezgin at Texas A&M University. String theory is a leading candidate for providing a framework that unifies the two pillars of our understanding of the laws of nature at the fundamental level, namely quantum theory and gravity. Its main premise is that all elementary particles in nature are different vibrations of an incredibly small fundamental string. Remarkably, the consistency of string theory requires extra dimensions, and the shape of these extra dimensions determines the spectrum of observed particles and the forces between them. For phenomena at low energies, string theory involves an extension of Einstein's theory of gravity, known as supergravity. As part of this research project, the PIs will explore fundamental aspects of string theory and supergravity. This is expected to enrich the interface between string theory and mathematics as well. This project advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in the US and seeking new physical laws describing uncharted territories involving not only the extreme conditions that existed in the era of the early universe but also the black hole environment where the gravitational force is extremely large. The PIs will also provide critical training to postdocs and students. They also intend to give public lectures on their research results and organize workshops. More technically, Professors Becker and Sezgin aim to address moduli stabilization in type IIB string theory compactified on Gepner models. The goal is to determine if the shape and size of the extra dimensions of string theory, which in four space-time dimensions are described by fields called moduli fields, can be predicted. If successful, this will increase the predictive power of string theory and could open the door to answering questions such as determining why we live in four space-time dimensions or why there are three families or generations of quark and leptons among the elementary particles. Further, the PIs will study the higher derivative couplings of supergravity theories and their spontaneous compactifications. Moreover, the PIs will determine candidate effective theories of quantum gravity that can in principle admit a UV completion. They will also study the geometrical description of duality symmetries of strings and branes in a powerful framework known as exceptional field theory.

Transient phases of  correlated excitons in small band gap semiconductors,"Excitons, which are bound states of electrons and holes, are fundamental excitations of semiconductors and essential to understand their optical and electronic properties. The new possibilities offered in material science by monolayers and heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides have considerably boosted the recent interest in exciton physics, even to the point that excitons are now considered as alternative particles in solid state devices. In this project, we propose to study the generation and evolution of phases of correlated excitons in small gap semiconductors with pump-probe techniques. We will use time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to extract the momentum-resolved dispersion of excitonic states transiently photoexcited. We will also use transient reflectivity measurements to prepare and complement the more demanding ARPES measurements. Our first goal is to identify and characterize dilute excitons in different materials. In a second step, we will investigate higher densities of transient excitons to access dense phases, for which electronic correlations become important. We will also explore the possibility of realizing a transient Bose-Einstein to BCS crossover of exciton condensates and study how these excitonic phases impact the electronic structure of selected materials.Our research project focuses on investigating the transient phases of correlated excitons, which builds upon recent theoretical predictions in this field. While there have been significant efforts devoted on studying excitons in van der Waals materials, limited knowledge exists regarding the impact of transient excitonic phases on the level of their electronic structures.",613663,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: DMREF: Designing Plasmonic Nanoparticle Assemblies For Active Nanoscale Temperature Control By Exploiting Near- And Far-Field Coupling,"With the support of the DMREF Program and the Division of Chemistry, Professor David J. Masiello from the University of Washington, Professor Stephan Link from Rice University, and Professor Katherine A. Willets from Temple University are developing methods to theoretically design and experimentally realize a new class of periodic 1D and 2D thermal metamaterials. Thermal energy, or heat, flows naturally from hot to cold, making it difficult to create localized thermal “hot spots” even when heat is applied to a single location. Said differently, the degree of spatial correlation between the heat power supplied and the temperature change that it induces is likely to be small. Touching a hot pan’s lid provides a simple and all too familiar example of this effect. As a material’s size is reduced to 10-100s of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, depositing and maintaining thermal energy within a small region of space becomes even more challenging. Yet, the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at both nanoscale (<100 nm) and micron-scale (~1-100 μm) dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from big data to nanomedicine. This research project aims to overcome thermal diffusion and achieve long-range global control of spatially-nonuniform heating, using only light to actively control the thermal profile of the materials. Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project will facilitate the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups, organization of two new scientific meetings, and the design of a nanotechnology summer camp for middle school students with focus on photothermal materials. The goal of this project is to overcome thermal diffusion through the theoretical design and experimental realization of a new class of periodic 1D and 2D thermal metamaterials. Plasmonic nanoparticle unit cells that are individually capable of hosting spatially-controllable nanoscale thermal profiles will be integrated into periodic lattices, which introduces the possibility for long-range global control of spatially-nonuniform heating upon optical excitation. To achieve this goal, the research team will (i) expand the design and thermal characterization capabilities for multi-particle unit cells that exploit near-field coupling; (ii) engineer photonic band structure to sculpt long-range thermal profiles in 1D and 2D Bravais lattices using light; and (iii) integrate multiple sub-lattices to realize 1D and 2D non-Bravais lattices to actively control both nanoscale and micron-scale thermal profiles using light. Realization of such thermally-active materials will require the coordinated and iterative efforts of a highly-skilled team capable of integrating new theoretical methods for predicting how light energy is transduced into modified thermal profiles with experimental fabrication and characterization techniques to design and quantify temperature across decades of length scales, spanning from below the diffraction limit to millimeters. This project will leverage the iterative theory-experiment-theory feedback loop to expand the genome of actively-controllable photothermal materials.

BSM-PM: NSF-ANR QISE: Quantum Sensing with Cryocrystals for Fundamental Physics (QUIC),"Despite the incredible success of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, there are still significant unsolved mysteries. The PI and co-PI will conduct experimental and theoretical research to investigate the use of quantum sensors to address some of these outstanding problems in fundamental physics. This work will be performed in synergistic collaboration with Laboratoire Aime Cotton, Orsay, France. The students and postdoctoral researchers on the project will be trained in the principles of quantum sensing and work to greatly improve the sensitivity of measurements by using novel quantum states. The research team will investigate alkali-metal atoms trapped in solid cryogenic matrices. Prior work by the PI's group has shown that ensembles of these atoms have excellent spin coherence times, along with the other properties needed for quantum sensing. Additionally, it is possible to create large-number samples which offer extremely good prospects for statistical sensitivity. Even more promising, this prior research has suggested that nonclassical spin superposition states may offer significantly longer ensemble spin dephasing times, which would be advantageous for experiments looking for symmetry violation using spin. The researchers will generate and investigate the properties of these nonclassical superposition states. In collaboration with the Orsay group, the researchers will investigate the potential of this system for measurements of the parity-violating nuclear anapole moment in cesium, as well as possible future experiments searching for time-violating electric dipole moments.

CAREER: Unconventional superconductivity and disordered criticality in two dimensions,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education aimed at understanding quantum phases of electrons in two-dimensional materials, with a focus on superconductivity and disorder. Although certain phases of matter are well-described in colloquial terms, for example liquid or solid, the fundamentally quantum nature of the universe supports a multitude of states beyond those we see in everyday life. The quantum nature of these phases often results in incredible properties; for instance, a superconducting system conducts without resistance, allowing electricity to be transported over arbitrary distances without energy loss. Recent experimental progress offers an exciting opportunity to improve our understanding of quantum systems whose electrons interact with each other strongly (i.e., the electrons strongly ``feels'' the presence of their peers), a class of systems that have historically been very difficult to describe theoretically. Experimentalists have achieved unprecedented control over the fabrication of two-dimensional materials such as graphene (an intrinsically two-dimensional material composed of carbon) and assemblies made from them, allowing the construction of systems that realize a variety of quantum phases. These developments support a relatively rapid interplay between theory and experiment, which this project will exploit to improve our general understanding of quantum matter. Specifically, this project aims to: (1) Develop a unified understanding of the superconducting phases seen in a variety of distinct graphene structures, systems constructed by stacking graphene in different ways. The PI will use a variety of theoretical techniques to investigate models for superconductivity based on features common to all superconducting graphene systems. (2) Characterize quantum phase transitions in 2D with disorder, such as impurities and other imperfections in the arrangement of atoms. Disorder is an unavoidable feature of all material systems. Quantum phase transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations in contrast to more familiar transitions like ice to water that are driven by thermal fluctuations. The PI will specifically focus on the transitions separating two quantum phases of matter, where disorder can have especially subtle consequences. Integrated within this research project is a multi-level plan aimed at promoting physics to underrepresented groups both before and during undergraduate education. Specifically, the PI will (i) foster early interest in condensed matter among high school students by developing and teaching a course about 2D quantum materials for a summer Science Apprenticeship program at River City High; (ii) encourage and support aspiring young scientists at both a high school and undergraduate level through a partnership with various mentoring programs; and (iii) initiate an undergraduate peer-mentoring program aimed at students belonging to underrepresented groups. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education into experimentally accessible properties of two-dimensional (2D) quantum phases of matter, focusing on superconducting graphene and the interplay of disorder and criticality. Theories of highly entangled quantum states of matter---their characterization and classification---have seen great strides in the past several decades. By contrast, an understanding of the prerequisites needed to physically realize these states and the criteria to identify them is lagging. An opportunity to narrow the gap between physical materials and theoretical understanding has recently arisen in the form of groundbreaking experimental developments in the synthesis and manipulation of true 2D materials, which have resulted in the discovery of a multitude of systems displaying a wide variety of correlated phases. The best-studied of these 2D systems are the van der Waals materials: not only can many different van der Waals systems be stacked in a nearly arbitrary fashion, but the twist angle between layers can also be specified. For sufficiently small twist angles, the result is a moiré superlattice orders of magnitude larger than the microscopic crystal of the constituent atoms. These advances provide a new set of tuning parameters---gating, stacking, and twist angle---to exploit in the pursuit of characterizing and understanding the ensuing quantum phenomena. The result is a relatively rapid interplay between theory and experiment, which this project will leverage in order to better understand the role of interactions, disorder, and their interplay in 2D systems. The specific aims of the project are: (1) The development of a unified understanding of superconducting graphene systems. Superconductivity has been observed in numerous graphene systems, both with and without moiré superlattices. The PI will investigate both the identity of the normal state parent to the superconductor as well as the superconducting pairing glue itself through a mix of analytical and numerical techniques. (2) An improved characterization and understanding of quantum critical points in 2D with disorder, drawing inspiration from recent experiments. The PI will both compute experimentally relevant observables as well as investigate the more formal question of disorder at a weak first order transition. Integrated within this research project is a multi-level plan aimed at promoting physics to underrepresented groups both before and during undergraduate education. Specifically, the PI will (i) foster early interest in condensed matter among high school students by developing and teaching a course about 2D quantum materials for a summer Science Apprenticeship program at River City High; (ii) encourage and support aspiring young scientists at both a high school and undergraduate level through a partnership with various mentoring programs; and (iii) initiate an undergraduate peer-mentoring program aimed at students belonging to underrepresented groups.

Resummation for Non-Global Observables at Hadron Colliders,"A crucial tool for predicting processes at high-energy colliders is perturbation theory, where cross sections are computed as an expansion in coupling constants. By going to higher orders, such predictions can be systematically improved. However, in problems involving several scales, higher-order corrections are enhanced by logarithms of the scale ratios and fixed-order predictions break down. There are  techniques for the resummation of the enhanced contributions and, similar to fixed-order predictions, resummed results can be systematically improved by including subleading logarithmic corrections. For simple observables resummations are carried out to very high logarithmic accuracy which leads to predictions with few-percent accuracy. Unfortunately, traditional resummation methods can only be applied to global observables which do not involve any angular cuts. Twenty years ago Dasgupta and Salam discovered that the pattern of enhanced higher-order terms is much more complicated for non-global observables. They were able to resum the leading non-global logarithms (NGLs) but the uncertainty at this order is sizable and for the large class of non-global observables, which includes jet cross sections, precise resummed results are currently not available. We were the first to derive factorization theorems for such observables. These provide the theoretical basis for higher-logarithmic resummation and over the past few years we have determined all necessary ingredients to perform resummations of subleading non-global logarithms. Using these, we now aim to develop a parton shower framework which resums the first tower of subleading non-global logarithms in the large-$N_c$ limit.While NGLs are a single-logarithmic effect at lepton colliders, at hadron colliders phase factors in the amplitudes lead to double-logarithmic corrections starting at four-loop order. These so-called super-leading logarithms (SLLs) were discovered a long time ago, but very little was known about the higher-order behavior of these terms and their process dependence. We recently solved the longstanding open problem of resumming SLLs for a large class of non-global observables at hadron colliders, accounting for the leading logarithmic corrections to (anti-)quark-induced processes for the first time. This opens the door for a systematic analysis of super-leading logarithms which we will now carry out.Our project extends precision resummation from the small set of global observables to a much wider class. With our analysis of SLLs we will, for the first time, be able to develop a complete theory of non-global observables at hadron colliders. This will lead to improved predictions for Higgs and photon production. Our work will also provide important input into the development of improved general-purpose parton showers.",607395,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"CAREER: Facets of gapless quantum matter: new phenomena, new tools, and new platforms","NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education focused on understanding the organization of interacting electrons in solid-state materials and the non-traditional ways in which their properties can change abruptly when specific conditions are adjusted. The traditional framework to understand electronic organizations and their transformations is based on the idea of symmetry, which in essence comes from intuition in classical physics. In recent years, it has been realized that the quantum mechanical nature of electrons allows for novel electronic states that differ by their so-called ""topological"" properties. For instance, some materials of the same symmetry that do not conduct electricity through their bulk can possess electronic states that allow them to conduct electricity on their surfaces, but with significantly different surface conducting properties. To comprehend the transitions between these fundamentally new electronic states, a fresh theoretical framework is essential, one that integrates the principles of quantum mechanics that dictate electron behavior. The aim of this project is to delve into the uncharted phenomena that can occur in these transformations, craft innovative theoretical tools to understand their properties, and design experimental setups to test these novel physics concepts. This research could lead to a general understanding of the diverse behavior of electrons in materials and potentially lay the groundwork for the material platforms for next-generation quantum devices. This award also supports educational activities which include mentoring graduate students and postdocs and developing new courses with emphasis on modern techniques in condensed matter theory. In addition to these educational activities, the PI will introduce a new outreach initiative named “Quantum Echoes: Uncovering Diverse Narratives in Physics”, a pioneering oral history project devoted to amplifying diverse voices in the physics community. The PI will organize students to conduct oral history interviews with underrepresented minority students and faculty members. The mission of the project is to provide a reservoir of encouragement, inspiration, and mentorship for young scientists, especially underrepresented students, and to humanize the realm of scientific discovery. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education focused on the study of the diverse quantum critical phenomena and gapless phases inherent in quantum many-body systems. Understanding the quantum critical fluctuations in a gapless state provides a universal understanding of its nearby phases and their finite temperature properties. These universal predictions are not only mathematically elegant but also readily testable in experiments. The PI and his team will focus on the following directions: 1) Exploring novel phenomena for phase transitions diverging from Landau’s paradigm by systematically constructing models of topological phase transitions which demonstrate the so-called multi-path quantum criticality where the same phase transition can have multiple paths each described by a distinct universality class; 2) Developing innovative tools to characterize quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems and non-Fermi liquid states. The PI will develop generalized network models, encompassing more complex low energy fluctuations and symmetry constrains, to describe quantum phase transitions between crystalline topological phases with strong interactions as well as non-Fermi liquid states with spatial and internal symmetries; and 3) Designing experimental platforms that offer precision and control for an in-depth exploration of strongly correlated gapless systems. The PI will show that twisted trilayer transition metal dichalcogenides can be an ideal system to realize moiré Kagome metals within certain conditions.

Gas-Phase Chemical and Spectral Modeling to Unlock the Diagnostic Potential of Cations in Small Body Atmospheres,"This research project will computationally characterize the production and generation of the cations CO+, N2+, and CO2+ in cometary atmospheres as a proxy for the parent neutral molecules O2, N2, and CO2 which are difficult or impossible to observe from Earth. The work will thus yield new volatile diagnostics for ground-based astronomy, and the results of the project will allow astronomers to understand the role of these ions in cometary atmospheres. This project will train graduate students and early career scientists in methods of advanced computational spectroscopy and chemical modeling important in astrophysics. The investigators will characterize the production and emission mechanisms of the cations using three complementary methods. First, they will compute the electronic structure and spectroscopic constants of the cations. Second, they will use these constants and existing literature to develop a fluorescence model to predict the emission spectra of the cations in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelength regions. Finally, they will use chemical reaction networks to quantify the location and strength of the emission in cometary atmospheres. The project will also promote K-12 STEM engagement by introducing local scout groups to astronomical topics including comets, planets, and asteroids through stargazing events.

CAREER: Modeling the Evolution of Massive Galaxies with Enzo-E,"The past few decades have seen tremendous advances in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution using both observations and detailed computer simulations. However, many key questions are still not fully understood. For example, most massive elliptical galaxies, among the oldest and most massive structures in the universe and hosts of supermassive black holes (SMBH), cease forming stars and transition into passively evolving systems. While the precise mechanisms underpinning such ""quenching"" are unclear, SMBHs appear to play a key role by suppressing the infall of fresh gas - the raw material of star formation - from the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The PI will conduct a computer simulation of a massive galaxy's formation and evolution with spatial resolution sufficient to resolve the CGM's complex structure and the small-scale physical processes occurring there. This work will inform and complement large-scale cosmological simulations and will provide mentoring and training for three graduate students in cutting edge galaxy simulations. Undergraduate students will also be involved, and the investigator will engage in outreach to local high schools and public planetarium shows. To better understand the evolution of massive galaxies, the investigator and her group will conduct a very high- resolution numerical study using a cosmological-zoom simulation focusing on the formation of a single massive galaxy while following its evolution all the way down to the current epoch (z = 0). The major objectives of this work are to understand (1) how SMBHs form and grow in massive galaxies, (2) precisely how SMBH ""feedback"" leads to star formation quenching, (3) the structure and evolution the CGM, and (4) how the evolution of satellite galaxies is affected. The team will use the newly developed Enzo-E, which is a highly scalable redesign of the original Enzo code for the exascale era. They will develop a new state-of-the-art SMBH formation/feedback model, which will be added to the publicly available code and shared with the community. The proposed simulations will force enhanced refinement in the galaxy's CGM, providing unprecedented details of this major gas reservoir around massive galaxies, which likely plays a key role in regulating the fueling of both SMBHs and star formation. This research will provide insight into the complex interplay between SMBHs, the CGM, and star formation in a massive galaxy, and it will provide a framework for simulating the effects of (e.g.) cosmic rays, dust, and radiative transfer.

CAREER: Interfacial behavior of motile bacteria at structured liquid crystal interfaces,"Non-technical abstract Understanding how bacteria interact with complex interfaces is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of microorganism life. These interfaces, where fluids meet, play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation, nutrient gathering, and gas exchange, offering valuable insights into microorganisms' ability to thrive in diverse conditions. Unfortunately, the interactions of bacteria with these domains are poorly understood due to the technical challenges scientists face in studying complex materials. This research aims to advance our knowledge of how interfaces influence the movement of living microorganisms. The research team utilizes ordered materials called liquid crystals, characterized by properties between liquids and solids, as a model system to study how microorganisms interact with intricate environments. Leveraging the tunable features of liquid crystals, the team explores ways to engineer the interface properties, enhancing control over bacterial flows and structural states. This work carries promising technological prospects as it opens avenues for the development of new functional systems applicable across fields including biosensing, bioremediation, and disease treatment. In addition to the technological impacts, the project is integrated with educational and outreach plans that incorporate examples of soft materials to improve the teaching of physics to life science students, create opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to experience research at an early stage, and make science enjoyable to the general public. Technical abstract Active materials are structured systems of interacting elements that propel motion and generate flows. The aspiration to regulate these flows has driven research efforts to develop functional systems applicable across various domains. This project addresses the challenge of establishing effective mechanisms to control flows in active materials. Mainly, it delves into exploring liquid crystal interfaces to govern the dynamic assembly of living active materials. The goal of this research is to deepen the understanding of how ordered materials influence the fundamental behaviors of active materials and how interfaces can be successfully designed to regulate flows within active entities. Self-propelled bacteria are utilized as a model system to investigate the impact of interfacial anisotropy and topological defects on the dynamics of active materials. Employing diverse microfabrication techniques, including lithography, 3D printing, and microfluidics, the team undertakes the confinement of liquid crystals and the engineering of their surface defects to direct the collective behavior of bacteria. The insights gained from this project contribute to the development of transformative applications with practical implications in diverse fields, especially those requiring the transformation of chaotic dynamics into useful work. The project also promotes educational opportunities by integrating education and research through the creation of opportunities for undergraduate students from nontraditional backgrounds to explore projects related to soft materials at an early stage, to prepare them for higher education and careers in STEM. In addition, the principal investigator is developing a distinct approach to improve the teaching of physics to life science students by implementing topics related to soft matter and elucidating the strong connections between physical concepts and biological systems. The insights and knowledge gained from understanding how active materials behave at complex fluid interfaces are also disseminated to general audiences through training modules and educational workshops.

Toward a New Era in Particle Astrophysics: Search for Antinuclei and Reduction of Critical Uncertainties in Antinuclei Production and Propagation,"In recent years, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on the International Space Station has reported detecting several antideuteron and antihelium nucleus candidates. The existence of cosmic antideuterons in the reported energy range might be the first sign of dark matter annihilation or decay, or of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. However, it could be explained by astrophysical background effects. This project will profoundly advance the understanding of cosmic antinuclei by analyzing an extended AMS-02 data set with state-of-the-art machine-learning analysis techniques and complementing their interpretation with data from the fixed-target SPS Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment (NA61/SHINE) at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at the European Laboratory for Particle Research (CERN). The group will provide a hands-on computer programming outreach program for underrepresented high school students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in cooperation with the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa's Office of Student Equity, Excellence, and Diversity. They are also developing strategies for increasing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education efforts for mature adults. The AMS-02 collaboration reported detecting several antideuteron and antihelium nucleus candidate events in approximately equal amounts in the energy region of a few GeV/n. However, no coherent theory exists that can explain a) the existence of any detectable antihelium flux in the Galaxy and b) that the number of antideuterons is comparable to the number of antihelium nuclei. AMS-02’s antideuteron candidates in the few-GeV/n region will be studied with new reconstruction and analysis methods, and systematic Galactic propagation uncertainties will be addressed by interpreting AMS-02’s nuclei measurements, and systematic uncertainties in the astrophysical antideuteron background production will be reduced with new and existing proton-proton collision data from NA61/SHINE in the energy range most relevant to cosmic rays.

Explorations in Non-Hermitian Physics: From Fundamentals to Quantum Information Science Applications,"For a quantum system that evolves in isolation, conservation of the total energy demands that the generator of the dynamics, the Hamiltonian, obeys the mathematical constraint of “Hermiticity” – which ensures that observable quantities evolve reversibly in time. Still, non-Hermitian dynamics emerge naturally in open quantum systems whenever the interaction with the environment cannot be ignored, and dissipative, irreversible evolution ensues. For quantum systems comprising many indistinguishable, “bosonic” degrees of freedom (such as photons, phonons, or even more exotic particles like “magnons”), non-Hermitian effects can arise in the dynamics as a sole consequence of quantum statistics, despite the physical Hamiltonian being Hermitian at the many-body level. The exploration of non-Hermitian dynamics has witnessed an impressive acceleration recently, due to both the merger with fundamental aspects from topological physics and the identification of novel dynamical phenomena. Exciting applications have been uncovered, ranging from enhanced parameter sensing to new modalities for quantum-limited amplification and routing of quantum information. The broad aim of this project is to advance the knowledge frontiers of non-Hermitian physics, by both using concepts and tools from quantum information science (notably, “entanglement”) to characterize aspects of non-Hermitian dynamics in bosonic systems, and by fully embracing an open-system paradigm where non-Hermitian attributes and dissipation are integral to the operation and control of quantum devices. In parallel, this program will incorporate a strong educational and training component at the graduate and postdoctoral level, on subjects at the boundary between open quantum systems and quantum statistical mechanics, dynamical system theory, and quantum information processing. This project will synergistically incorporate theory and experiment throughout its duration. It builds on a body of theoretical results that the principal investigator has established for bosonic systems described by quadratic (“Lindblad”) master equations and on the joint experimental realization of a tunable non-Hermitian nonlinear microwave-cavity dimer, while pushing the investigation in several new directions. Specific research objectives include: (i) to obtain a complete theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian dynamics in quadratic bosonic systems, by seeking a characterization of dynamical stability phase transitions through the lenses of entanglement theory, and by allowing for explicit time-dependence, with a focus on Floquet non-Hermitian dynamics; (ii) to experimentally demonstrate a quantum analog of the tunable nonlinear dimer we have currently realized at room temperature, and leverage it towards achieving enhanced quantum state transfer in quantum networks; (iii) to make headway toward implementing and exploring many-body non-Hermitian nonlinear dynamics in a six-site bosonic system. Besides being responsive to a timely motivation, we expect the proposed program to contribute fundamental insight into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and many-body quantum physics. From a practical standpoint, these investigations may point to enhanced protocols for dissipative quantum information processing directly applicable in circuit quantum-electrodynamic settings.

"CAREER: Emergent Phases: Fracton, Symmetry, and Decoherence","NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports research and education activities towards advancing our understanding of an unusual phase of matter known as the ""fracton"" phase. Fractons are unique particle-like responses in certain materials that have distinctive behavior: Unlike familiar particles like electrons or protons, they cannot move freely and often require binding in groups in order to move. This intriguing property is transforming our understanding of matter and sparking interest across diverse fields such as quantum materials, quantum field theory, and quantum information science. The restricted mobility of fractons also offers exciting potential for breakthroughs in emerging technologies, especially in developing quantum hardware and efficient quantum computers. The research will focus on three main objectives: 1) developing theoretical approaches to understand the collective behavior of fractons, 2) investigating fractons in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment introduce challenges like noise and interference, and 3) designing algorithms that enable control of fracton phases in dynamic, out-of-equilibrium settings. Progress in these areas is key to leveraging fractons for quantum error correction and information processing technologies. This CAREER award also supports educational and outreach activities to train, mentor, energize, and retain students in STEM by providing immersive learning experiences. The PI will expand outreach to encourage female students and postdocs in STEM through the Women in Quantum Era seminar series and inspire future STEM aspirants through the Science Inspired by Art workshop, which will employ modular origami and decorative knots to interactively explore geometry and related scientific ideas. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education to understand the interplay between symmetry and decoherence in fracton and topological phases under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. The project aims to study fracton and topological states by constructing microscopic models and developing hybrid fracton field theories, allowing for the exploration of various correlated phases and phase transitions. A key component of this research involves open quantum systems, investigating whether fracton states can retain quantum coherence and entanglement in noisy environments, and exploring if decoherence can give rise to unique mixed ensembles absent in thermal equilibrium. Expected outcomes include advancements in quantum field theory frameworks with generalized symmetries and insights into dissipation and decoherence in dynamical phase transitions. More broadly, this research connects the fields of condensed matter and quantum information theory, with potential applications in scalable quantum simulators and robust quantum information processing.

CAREER: Geometry and topology of quantum materials,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports research and education in the rapidly evolving field of quantum materials. Quantum materials refer to those in which the collective behavior of electrons gives rise to extraordinary properties with potential applications in quantum technologies from spintronics to quantum computing. In a paradigm shifting discovery, topology, the field in mathematics that describes properties which remain unchanged when objects are deformed, was recognized to result in remarkable materials such as those that are insulators in the interior but possess dissipationless electric conduction through states on their surfaces and edges that are required to exist by topology. Less explored but equally remarkable is the crucial role that topology plays in determining which phases of electronic matter are found in each material, and the possibility they might be long sought-after exotic electronic states of matter. Examples are superconductivity where electrons flow with exactly zero resistance in the entire material or phases where electrons seem to dissociate into smaller entities with unconventional properties, called fractionalized phases. The PI will study how topology and quantum geometry, the geometric properties of an abstract representation of quantum states, can influence the nature of electrons in matter, particularly when unavoidable imperfections or “dirt” are present in materials. Careful control of defects may enable phases of electronic matter with desired properties to be realized. Through this research, the PI aims to gain insights into the stability of unique quantum phenomena, as well as offer new mathematical tools for the characterization of topological quantum materials and for the prediction and, working with experiment, the discovery of new ones. In this project, research and education are integrated through multiple efforts focusing on graduate students that will enhance and diversify their training in quantum properties of matter. The activity will include a bootcamp covering essentials of topological materials and computational techniques for studying their electronic properties. The PI will also organize a workshop to showcase talented young researchers from diverse backgrounds working on quantum materials. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education aimed to study the influence of quantum geometry in the collective properties of electrons in the solid state. The PI will explore how the momentum space textures of electron wavefunctions affect electron behavior in both clean and dirty materials, influencing long-range coherence, transport, and the emergence of exotic excitations. The project focuses on a new perspective on quantum materials, with the aim to unify quantum geometric phenomena from the point of view of the structure of the Green’s function operator, in particular its topologically robust zeros when projected to various spatial defects. The goal of this approach is to construct tools that can be efficiently applied to identify nontrivial geometry both in systems with and without translational symmetry, therefore opening the possibility to 1) characterize the behavior of disordered topological crystalline matter; 2) offer guidelines for the search of new materials with exceptional physical properties; 3) identify robust physical responses that stem from the nontrivial geometry of the ground state. This approach is set to contribute significantly to the burgeoning field of topological matter, with applications in electronic structure theory, chemistry, and materials science. This activity also includes establishing a bootcamp for the computation of materials topological properties covering the essentials of band theory, group theory, and density functional theory, and allowing students to gain ""hands-on"" experience simulating various quantities of experimental and technological relevance. The PI also aims to establish a New York City based workshop to spotlight excellent young researchers from diverse backgrounds.

Relaxation and Dissociation Dynamics of Anionic and Neutral Species Studied by Extreme Ultraviolet Time-resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Flat Liquid Jets,"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Daniel Neumark of the University of California, Berkeley will use time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to watch the relaxation and dissociation of a solvated molecule that occurs following photon absorption. In photoelectron spectroscopy, a high-energy photon is used to detach one of the electrons in a molecule, and the velocity of the departing electron contains information about the molecular energy states at the instant of ejection. The method can be applied to any molecule and has been used to great effect in the study of isolated gas phase molecules for decades. However, analogous studies in liquids are considerably more challenging since the surrounding solvent could interfere with motion of the departing electron. Professor Neumark and his students will pass the solutions through liquid jets, which will enable the study of solvated molecules using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Their approach has the potential to address the origin and mechanism of photostability in molecules including DNA constituents, which have strong UV absorption yet do not dissociate. The project will also contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce by providing research opportunities for graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral scholars. Under this award, photoexcited anionic and neutral solutes in flat liquid jets will be studied by the UC-Berkeley team using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photoelectron spectroscopy. Femtosecond ultraviolet (UV) pump and XUV probe pulses will excite the solute and then follow its dynamics by measuring the photoelectron spectrum as a function of UV/XUV delay. Experiments will be carried out using probe photon energies of 22 eV and 90 eV. Light at 22 eV serves as a universal valence ionization probe; one can ionize valence electrons from initially excited electronic states and from any electronic states populated by subsequent relaxation. Target systems of these experiments are the phenolate and nitrophenolate anions as well as the neutral species indole and tryptophan. At 90 eV, one can photoionize I(4d) core electrons and thus monitor time-dependent chemical shifts in the photodissociation of iodine-containing species. Experiments at 90 eV will first be carried out on aqueous iodide anions in order to track energies and solvent relaxation upon excitation of the charge-transfer-to-solvent band of iodide at 240 nm. Experiments on photoexcited iodobenzene and iodophenolate at both probe energies will probe the competition between relaxation within the manifold of valence states on the aromatic ring and dissociation to iodine atoms or iodide anions. Such experiments, if successful, will serve to significantly extend the range of experiments available to photoelectron spectroscopy, giving valuable information about chemical dynamics and solvent effects in the condensed phase.

Precision Experiments with Cold Neutrons,"This grant supports a program of precise experiments with low energy (cold) neutrons. With the first project, the Nab and pNab experiments, the PI and his team continue a new study of neutron beta decay. The goals of this project tackle two of three items in a list of priorities listed in the Weak Interaction section of the new Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science. The main purpose of the measurements is to shed light on recent evidence for a failure of the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics. The discovery of Beyond-Standard-Model physics would have important implications for High Energy Physics and Cosmology. With the second project, the PI and his team study states of cold neutrons with the goal to detect new short-range forces. Furthermore, the project has a valuable impact on higher education: Most of the work is done by students at undergraduate and graduate levels, and these students will earn valuable skills and experiences for their future career. The redundancy inherent in the Standard Model description of the neutron beta decay process allows uniquely sensitive checks of the model’s validity and limits: The neutrino-electron-correlation coefficient “𝑎” will allow an extraction of “𝑉ud”, the upper left element of the CKM matrix, with the purpose to test the matrix’s unitarity. A recent re-evaluation of radiative corrections made it appear that the CKM unitarity is violated. A non-unitarity CKM matrix is not possible within the SM. It would signal that either physics at a scale of several TeV affects how CKM matrix elements are computed from observables, or that we have more than three quark generation even if those extra quarks have masses that makes them undetectable directly. The other observable, the Fierz term, allows verifying hints for non-SM effective scalar or tensor interactions at low energies, in a complementary way to what is expected from LHC. Measurements of electron and proton asymmetry with a polarized beam with pNab add precision and redundancy. The studies are performed by the Nab collaboration, of which the PI is the experiment director. The grant funds the PI’s group’s specific contributions to the Nab and pNab project in leadership, simulation, data analysis, neutron beam polarization and in the characterization of the proton detection efficiency. With the whispering gallery experiment, spectroscopy of gravitationally bound quantum states of ultracold neutrons will be performed. The results are sensitive to new short- range interactions at a length scale of nanometers which could be mediated by so far undiscovered pseudoscalar bosons (axion-like particles). Those would contribute to the answer to the question about the nature of dark matter. The PI is strongly committed to attracting members of underrepresented groups and is leading a diverse research group. The PI will try to obtain funding for a REU program at UVa. The program would attract students from elsewhere, including the many minority-serving institutions in the area.

Gravitational Wave Transient Astrophysics with LIGO,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. This award supports LIGO science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The discovery of gravitational waves by NSF's Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has revolutionized astrophysics and unveiled a cosmic symphony of colliding black holes and neutron stars. Gravitational waves provide a new window into the dynamic universe, promising exciting insights into the nature of gravity, the origins of heavy elements, and the evolution of the cosmos. By detecting and interpreting these ripples in spacetime, this project advances the understanding of the universe and its most extreme phenomena. The award also supports the training of a diverse group of students, nurturing the next generation of scientists and promoting inclusive excellence in STEM. Through public outreach activities, the team supported by this award will share the excitement of gravitational wave discoveries with the broader community, inspiring curiosity and a sense of wonder about the universe. This project aligns with NSF's mission by expanding the frontiers of knowledge and benefits society by cultivating a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The goal of this project is to advance LIGO science by detecting, characterizing, and interpreting gravitational wave transients in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data. The team of scientists and students supported by this award will employ a combination of morphology-independent techniques, template-based approaches, and multi-messenger strategies to optimize the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers and other astrophysical sources. Key objectives include improving software infrastructure to reduce computing time and enhance accessibility, mitigating the impact of noise transients on LIGO science, and participating in the fourth LIGO observing run. The team will also support student-led exploration of novel approaches to detecting gravitational wave transients. By advancing gravitational wave detection methods and contributing to LIGO's scientific priorities, this award will deepen the understanding of black holes, neutron stars, and other extreme cosmic phenomena, while also supporting the development of data analysis techniques and fostering collaboration within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the broader astrophysics community.

Measuring Magnetic Field Dynamics Generated by Laser-Driven Electron Beams in Plasma Channels,"Laser-plasma interactions can be used to create bright, directional and ultrashort charged particle beams and high-energy photons that have many potential scientific, technological, and engineering applications. This project will enable experimental measurements of extremely large magnetic fields generated in laser plasma interactions. These magnetic fields often play a critical role in the interactions because they can profoundly alter the behavior of a plasma or charged particle beam. A charged particle-probe set up will be developed and characterized for the National Science Foundation ZEUS laser user facility to make measurements of the dynamic magnetic fields. These measurements will advance our understanding of the complex processes occurring in laser-plasma particle accelerators. The particle-probing diagnostic development will also enhance ZEUS’s overall capabilities for the benefit of the broader ZEUS user community. The goal of the project is to investigate and measure the extremely large magnetic fields generated by electron beams driven in plasma channels. High-intensity laser pulses interacting with low density targets can create a plasma channel, and accelerate forward directed electron beams that self-generate large azimuthal magnetic fields within the channel. These magnetic fields are understood to be crucial for direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons, for the generation of bright, directional x-rays and gamma beams, and for the promising ion acceleration mechanism of magnetic vortex acceleration. Measuring the electric or magnetic fields inside a plasma is challenging, particularly when the fields are dynamic and rapidly evolving. However, significant advances have been made in both charged particle probing techniques and the unfolding algorithms, so it is now possible to measure extremely transient fields with femtosecond temporal and micrometer spatial resolutions. Once measured, these magnetic fields may also be configured in a reconnection geometry for future laboratory studies. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",600000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Probing the Quark Gluon Plasma with Jet Tomography,"Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong nuclear force and predicts a unique state of matter called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is made of free quarks and gluons. During high-speed collisions of heavy ions, nuclei break down into these basic particles, forming the QGP. This matter was found to behave like a nearly perfect liquid at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Scientists continue to study the QGP, with RHIC offering a wide range of collision energies and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reaching the highest temperatures and energy densities. With this award, the PI and graduate students will investigate the properties of the QGP. They will measure observables that arise when jets of particles move through the QGP. Their aim is to move from a basic description of the QGP to a detailed understanding of its properties. The PI also aims to boost diversity and competitiveness in U.S. STEM fields by inspiring female students, recruiting women and minority undergraduates in physics, and involving them in research. The PI's research will use hard probes to study the QGP. She will measure jet observables in heavy-ion collisions at LHC using the CMS detector and at RHIC using the STAR detector. To map out the phase diagram of the QGP at different scales, the PI and her team will measure the center of mass energy dependence of jet shapes for inclusive jets and jets coincident with vector bosons. This will help constrain the jet energy, enabling a controlled measurement of how the medium modifies jets and the plasma's response. Additionally, they will directly measure heavy flavor quark jets and D0 meson-tagged jets at lower kinematic regions where mass effects are significant, probing the flavor dependence of parton energy loss. The research will incorporate machine learning techniques to simultaneously analyze jet measurements, enhancing the precision and efficiency of data interpretation. These complementary measurements will determine key features of the QGP, including its thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients, how it responds to jet energy loss, and how it affects jet structures. Furthermore, the PI will promote STEM education for underrepresented minorities through initiatives such as encouraging female middle and high school students to pursue STEM, incorporating high-energy nuclear physics research into introductory physics courses, and mentoring minority students throughout the research process.

CAREER: First-Principles Discovery of Optically Excited States in Van der Waals Magnetic Structures,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports research and educational activitives aimed at understanding the quantum behavior of a class of magnetic materials known as van der Waals (vdW) magnets. These magnets display various types of magnetic ordering when they are thinned to one layer or very few sheets of material. Because of their unique responses to illumination by light, these materials are currently one of the frontiers of materials research. The PI and his team will develop new computational methods and apply them to understand light-matter interactions in vdW magnets directly from fundamental quantum laws, without relying on empirical parameters. This approach enables comprehensive understanding of various aspects of vdW magnets upon optical excitations, such as magnetic control of optical properties. Such fundamental understanding and prediction of material response are crucial for advancing technologies like optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and quantum information science. The project also includes significant educational components. It will provide training for students and professionals in physics, materials science, and quantum technology. Through initiatives like “STEM-pals” and “Data Science for Future Materials Science Workforce,” the project will educate K-12 students and enhance undergraduate and graduate curricula in these fields. These educational efforts are particularly focused on engaging underrepresented groups, promoting diversity in science and technology, and preparing the next generation of innovators.

Collaborative Research: Multi-wavelength Imaging of Planet-Forming Disks: The inner AU of Herbig and T Tauri Stars,"Astronomers are just beginning to understand when and how planets form around young stars, with deep implications on the prospects for life in the Universe. While rocky planets similar to Earth are located close to their stars, these innermost regions are typically too close-in to study with conventional telescopes. This project will combine light from multiple telescopes operating as an interferometer – the CHARA array - to measure the temperature and map the surface density of the inner disk surrounding solar-mass and intermediate-mass young stars. Repeated observations will track moving clumps of dust that could be indicating accretion/wind physics or local planet formation. Outreach programs at rural community colleges will draw local high school students into higher education. An inspiring educational experience is planned for middle-schoolers in “Wolverine Pathways,” a University of Michigan program offered to communities in the Detroit-metro area who are historically under-represented in state colleges. The CHARA Array is the longest-baseline optical/infrared interferometer in the world. Researchers at the University of Michigan developed the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments which combine all six CHARA telescopes with broad 1.1-2.5μm wavelength coverage simultaneously, while also supporting access by the broader astronomical community through open time administered by NOIRLAB. In commissioning data, the team has discovered hot, time-variable emission inside the expected dust destruction radius. In this project, they make a modest upgrade to the telescopic instrumentation; measure multiwavelength data to assess the disks temperature; expand the target sample to stars of diverse masses, luminosities, ages, and accretion rates; and measure time-domain follow-up data. This project improves research infrastructure by providing new software tools, such as the first MYSTIC-ABCD pipeline, written in Python and C, and it makes the source code publicly available. Regarding broader impact, an outreach program with St. Clair County Community College develops authentic research modules with an internet-enabled telescope, supporting STEM students transferring to 4-year colleges.

"Faster, Better, Deeper: Discovery and Study of the Faintest Kuiper Belt Objects using Novel Computational Tools","The solar system beyond Neptune is home to thousands of small, icy bodies known as trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) that are believed to be largely unchanged since the giant planets coalesced from the proto-planetary disk and migrated to their present locations. TNOs constitute an archaeological window into the solar system’s formation and early evolution. Using a machine-learning-based shift-and-stack pipeline, the team has detected TNOs roughly two magnitudes fainter than any previous survey of comparable area. This project will extend this work and enhance its detection sensitivity to discover fainter objects. The team will produce source catalogs of transient and moving objects and release software tools for the benefit of the broader astronomical community. This project will directly fund the Ph.D. thesis of one graduate student and will involve several undergraduate students who will acquire skills in data analysis, astronomical observing, mentoring, and in presenting results through publications, posters, and talks. The DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP) is a NOIRlab survey that was awarded 46.5 nights on the 4-meter Blanco telescope at CTIO to explore the faintest trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) ever observed from Earth. The full DEEP data that will be analyzed in the proposed work will achieve single-night detections of nearly 7,000 TNOs, which will enable measurements of physical and dynamical properties to be broken down by dynamical subclass. The team will develop and implement a novel shift-and-stack formulation called HelioStack, an algorithm that efficiently links DEEP detections across multiple oppositions. Using HelioStack, the project will obtain multi-opposition orbits of roughly 400 TNOs, which will be the largest sample of ultra-faint (r ~ 26) TNOs to date. DEEP will also discover roughly 20,000 new asteroids and provide time-series photometry for these objects.

NANOGrav Student Teams of Astrophysics Researchers Undergraduate Pathways (STARS-UP): Infrastructure for the Two to Four-Year College Transition,"The proposed STARS-UP (Students Teams of Astrophysics Researchers - Undergraduate Pathways) program will create research partnerships between five two-year community and technical colleges (CTC), four four-year colleges (FYC), including the lead institution West Virginia University, and the Green Bank Observatory. The overarching goal of the research partnerships is to increase diversity, and retention of that diversity, in STEM by creating CTC and FYC partnerships, which will allow CTC students and faculty to conduct original scientific research in a local chapter of a national astrophysics research community while providing them with STEM mentoring. First-generation, underrepresented minority, and other students from low socioeconomic status communities represent the largest untapped STEM talent pool in the U.S. STARS-UP will build a sustainable pipeline to careers in astronomy, physics, and the greater STEM enterprise for students who begin their post-secondary education at community or two-year colleges and transfer to four-year colleges. The project will include collaboration between the NSF-funded Pulsar Search Collaboratory, North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center, and the First2 Network, West Virginia’s NSF INCLUDES Alliance, and will build on several successful education programs. STARS-UP will pair each CTC with a nearby FYC to form bilateral research and mentoring partnerships. These CTC-FYC pairs will work together on a research project throughout the academic year. Project activities will include online training sessions with all participants, local meetings between each CTC-FYC pair, a summer workshop at the Green Bank Observatory, attendance at NANOGrav meetings, and development of faculty and peer mentoring networks. Multiple levels of research projects will be available to students as they progress through the program, ultimately leading to publishable research papers. The project also provides a pathway for CTC faculty to become full members of NANOGrav, hence ensuring sustainability of the STARS-UP initiative. Through involvement with large scientific organizations, the network will be offered as a model community. The project will also include examination of the cumulative impact of participation on retention, transfer, and graduation rates for STARS-UP students compared to historical STEM student data from each CTC institution as well as the impact on STEM interest, STEM belonging, and STEM and cultural identities of participating students.

WoU-MMA: Engine-Powered Transients from Compact Object Birth,"Surveys of the night sky have discovered classes of objects that are hundreds of times brighter than ordinary stellar explosions. The origins of these events are not understood, because they require a novel source of power. One potential power source is a rapidly spinning neutron star, which emits a magnetized wind of charged particles similar to, but more extreme, than our own Sun’s solar wind. Over a three year program, a team led by the principal investigator at Columbia University will perform computer simulations that predict the radiation emitted from neutron star winds and how it propagates through the debris of an explosion. The calculations will also be applied to spinning neutron stars created from the merger of two neutron stars. These events represent sources of gravitational wave emission whose electromagnetic counterparts will be predicted. The research program will provide training for undergraduate students with technical skills in radiation hydrodynamics and computation. A week-long international workshop will be organized on gravitational wave astrophysics to train the larger community. A growing number of stellar explosions have been discovered with peak luminosities too high to be powered by traditional energy sources, such as radioactive decay. These include the rare class of stellar core collapse known as “superluminous supernovae” (SLSNe), as well as luminous transients with fast evolving light curves, indicative of explosions with lower ejecta masses (“Fast Blue Optical Transients”; FBOTs). The best-studied FBOT, AT2018cow, peaked on a timescale of only a few days and was accompanied by non-thermal emission from radio to X-rays to gamma-rays. Powering the light curves of SLSNe and FBOTs requires prolonged heating of the ejecta by a central energy source, such as an accreting black hole or the rotationally-powered wind of a magnetar with a millisecond spin period. The investigators will create computer models of engine-powered transients that predict the radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emissions. Synchrotron radio emission from the nebula will be calculated. The predictions of this work will be tested with data obtained with ground and space-based observatories. Their results will also enable predictions for the emission from binary neutron star mergers that might be detected with LIGO/Virgo. Research and educational goals will be integrated in two ways: (1) Undergraduate students are directly involved in key aspects of the proposed research, exposing them to an active and supportive research environment; (2) A week-long international workshop will be organized on time-domain gravitational wave astrophysics.

Collaborative Research: WoU-MMA: Surveying black hole growth history through accretion and mergers,"This project aims to uncover the secrets behind the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) located at the centers of galaxies. These enormous black holes are crucial for understanding the evolution of the Universe, as they significantly influence their host galaxies by affecting star formation and the development of galactic structures. The primary focus is to explore how SMBHs grow, either through the accumulation of matter or by merging with other black holes. The research will also provide educational opportunities and foster diversity within the scientific community. By engaging with the Native Hawaiian community and other underrepresented groups, the project aims to inspire and nurture the next generation of scientists. The project's main goal is to understand the growth mechanisms of supermassive black holes. It has three specific objectives: 1) to determine the merger rates of SMBHs and relate these to gravitational wave observations; 2) to investigate the growth of SMBHs during the peak period of black hole activity (known as cosmic noon) and its connection to accretion rates; and 3) to map the complete history of SMBH accretion. The research employs a multiwavelength survey approach, leveraging optical, infrared, and X-ray observations to minimize bias against obscured black holes. Advanced AI techniques will be used to analyze large imaging surveys, identifying dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxy mergers. This will help predict gravitational wave events and measure black hole masses and luminosities. Data will be collected using various observatories, including privileged access to Euclid data and several ground-based telescopes. Results will be shared through AGN-DB, an AI-managed database, and supported by tools like THALES and AGNFinder for comprehensive data integration. The project also includes significant educational outreach and diversity initiatives, providing research experiences and professional development for underrepresented students in astronomy.

DMRG Studies of Strongly Correlated Systems,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to advance the understanding of materials in which strong interactions among electrons lead to interesting and useful properties. Among these is superconductivity, a quantum state of many electrons in a metal that is characterized by the absence of all electrical resistance. Understanding how superconductivity arises in a family of materials called the cuprates, which are composed of stacked planes containing copper and oxygen atoms, is particularly important because the superconductivity occurs at relatively high temperatures, accessible with inexpensive types of refrigeration. Physicists try to understand such strongly correlated materials using simplified models, where if the model is correct, the solution of the model matches the experimental properties. For the cuprates, since their discovery in 1987, most of the attention has focused on one model, the Hubbard model. Unfortunately, the Hubbard model can only be solved approximately through numerical simulation on supercomputers, and even that is extremely challenging. Conflicting results have been obtained by different groups and simulation approaches for decades. In the last few years, this situation has changed; now, by combining different simulation approaches, consensus on this problem is emerging. In work supported by the previous award, the PI in collaboration with several other groups worldwide has numerically solved the Hubbard model accurately enough to answer the question: Can the model give a correct but simplified description of cuprate superconductivity? The answer turns out to be yes, it does: the simulations obtained superconductivity of the right type with stronger superconductivity for the materials where it should be stronger. This current renewal grant will continue this project, investigating other microscopic properties in addition to superconductivity, and relating all the properties in more detail to what experiments show for specific cuprate materials. One of the most challenging difficulties in programming either a quantum computer or a supercomputer to solve the quantum mechanical equations of molecules, for applications such as drug design, is the complexity of the equivalent of the Hubbard model, called the ""molecular Hamiltonian"", which has millions or billions of terms. The investigator and his group have been working on unconventional “diagonal"" models with orders of magnitude fewer terms. Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this on very simple molecules, and the current project will generalize this to arbitrary molecules, with the goal of improving both quantum and ordinary computer simulations substantially. With previous NSF support, the PI and his group created the ITensor software library, the most widely used library for tensor network calculations, used in the calculations described above. ITensor continues to grow in its use worldwide, and the team continues to aid its development and plan its future development. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical and computational research and education in the exciting area of condensed matter physics focused on the study of strong correlation effects in low dimensional systems. These systems exhibit a wide range of behavior, such as high temperature superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, and striped and spin liquid phases. Simulation techniques are increasingly necessary to understand these systems, as they have strong coupling and competing types of order. The PI is the inventor of the density matrix renormalization group(DMRG), one of the most powerful techniques for studying these systems. The PI's group will apply DMRG and related tensor network techniques to a variety of strongly correlated systems. One focus during this period will be studies of stripe order, pairing, and pseudogap behavior in models describing the cuprates. Another focus will be applying time dependent DMRG techniques to study dynamical and finite temperature properties of two-dimensional Hubbard and t-J models, and frustrated spin liquid systems. A third will be developing our Gausslet basis sets for chemically more realistic descriptions of strongly correlated systems. The use of 2D DMRG on cylinders with finite but increasingly wide circumferences has contributed to major recent progress that has been made in the ability to simulate 2D quantum systems. The PI and his group have pioneered these methods, which can produce accurate results on 2D doped or frustrated systems with 200-400 sites. They will increasingly focus on finite temperature and dynamical properties of these systems in order to better connect with experiments. These studies will utilize the minimally entangled typical thermal states algorithm, developed by the PI, to study the relationship between pseudogap behavior, Fermi surface reconstruction, and stripes in Hubbard models, while generating spectral functions for close comparison to experiments. Similar techniques will be applied to study new frustrated magnetic systems with the potential for spin liquid behavior. For the study of the electronic structure of strongly correlated solids and molecules, the nested-Gausslet basis sets developed by the group allow an efficient diagonal approximation for the molecular Hamiltonian. This greatly reduces Hamiltonian complexity, potentially speeding up a wide variety of calculations both on classical and quantum computers. Previous work could only treat simple, linear molecules. The team will continue to develop these methods to apply to any molecule or solid. The algorithms and software developed by PI and his group have had a very broad impact on a variety of fields, including chemistry, computer science, numerical analysis, and machine learning. Under previous NSF support, a notable success was the development of the Intelligent Tensor (ITensor, available at ITensor.org) library, now broadly used for DMRG, matrix product state, and related tensor network methods. The project will continue to support the development of ITensor, particularly to utilize continuing advances in the software field.

Towards a Self-Consistent Multi-Scale Theory of the Feedback-Cycle in Massive Galaxies,"The successful launch and commissioning of the James Web Space Telescope (JWST) is transforming astrophysical observation by unveiling unprecedented details of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and beyond, complementing ground-based facilities like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The increasing wealth of observational data necessitates a deeper theoretical understanding of galaxy evolution and the mechanisms that influence and shape them. To extract meaningful insights and make accurate interpretations of this data, it is crucial to integrate knowledge across multiple scales in a comprehensive manner.My Ambizione Fellowship addresses fundamental questions in galaxy evolution by working towards a self-consistent multi-scale theory of galactic winds in massive galaxies. Such a theoretical framework is essential for unifying our understanding of feedback mechanisms across multiple scales, thereby providing a holistic view of the forces driving galaxy evolution.My research is at the interface between detailed small-scale ISM simulations and large-scale cosmological simulations. With the proposed work, I will combine these complementary perspectives and lay the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of how various physical processes influence the evolution of massive galaxies across cosmic time.An essential component of numerical simulations is the correct estimation of inflow and outflow of gas which regulates star formation rates. These rates are pivotal for galaxy evolution, influencing properties like morphology, luminosity, and the chemical enrichment of the ISM and Circum Galactic Medium (CGM). Massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) inject energy and momentum into the ISM at sub-parsec scales, driving winds that span tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs. However, we lack a clear understanding of how different feedback processes couple to the ISM locally and how the launched winds propagate out to larger scales. This is challenging, as the numerical modelling of the feedback cycle is complicated by the extremely wide dynamical range of space and time. Accurate physical models and numerical simulations are required to precisely describe the properties of the multi-phase ISM and the physical processes shaping it, while also accounting for the large-scale environment.Specifically, I will employ a physically validated approach in modelling the intricate co-evolution of different stellar and AGN feedback channels with the well-resolved ISM. The proposed work will provide a comprehensive picture of the role different feedback mechanisms play in shaping the ISM's structure of massive galaxies and how the winds are launched and propagate out. This work will serve as a cornerstone for a nuanced and comprehensive theory of galactic winds in massive galaxies and will address key challenges in modern studies of galaxy formation and evolution.Using large-scale `zoom-in' simulations I will study galaxies within their realistic cosmological context and develop a novel method to increase resolution at the galaxy-halo interface, where the outflows interact with the complex multi-phase CGM. The proposed work will improve our understanding of how galactic winds propagate out from the galaxy and interact with its immediate surroundings. This will be a significant step towards coherently connecting the cosmological large-scale with small-scale ISM models.A necessary next step in the quest for a multi-scale theory of galaxy evolution is to connect the large-scale context back to the ISM scales. In an ambitious and novel approach, I will use the large-scale cosmological simulations to inform initial conditions of highly resolved idealised galaxy-scale simulations and assess the consistency between the two approaches, specifically focusing on emergent wind phenomena.This research is timely and significant, offering interpretive power for emerging observational data from campaigns like ALMA and JWST. In addition, my project aligns with computational advances and will guide future technology needs, particularly through new emerging hardware and co-design, as we transition into the era of exascale supercomputing.",585875,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
Testing the Standard Model with Parity-Violating Electron Scattering,"A central goal of contemporary fundamental physics is to find evidence for new physics, beyond the scope of the Standard Model of particle physics, and to characterize its features once such evidence is found. One avenue to search for new physics is the ""Precision frontier"" where precise measurements are made of quantities that are precisely predicted by the Standard Model - a deviation from this prediction would signal new physics. This project supports one such measurement, the MOLLER experiment, which will determine the electron-electron weak interaction to unprecedented precision, using the electron accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The team will construct and commission several components of the particle detection system and will develop the particle-tracking software to be used in the data analysis. Graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher will actively participate and thereby develop skills in precision nuclear physics experimentation and in the analysis of large and complex data sets. The MOLLER experiment will use parity-violating electron-electron scattering to extract the electroweak mixing angle to a precision comparable to the best available high-energy measurements, through a measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The expected 35 ppb parity-violating asymmetry in the scattering cross section will be determined to a precision of 0.5 ppb, five times smaller than the only previous measurement. The William & Mary group will provide the detector system used to characterize one of the most important background processes, electro- and photo-production of pions, and will lead the effort to create and commission the particle-reconstruction software used in the calibration of the spectrometer acceptance and to correct for various backgrounds.

"Laboratory Studies of Laser-Driven, Ion-Scale Mini-Magnetospheres on the LArge Plasma Device","Magnetospheres form when a flowing plasma, like the solar wind, impacts a magnetic obstacle, like a planet, and are an integral part of space weather systems. Earth’s magnetosphere has been observed by spacecraft for decades, but magnetospheres can also exist on much smaller scales, such as around small moons or asteroids that are difficult to study directly. This project utilizes laboratory experiments to create and explore artificial versions of these “mini” magnetospheres. By leveraging the ability of laboratory experiments to be carried out with high repeatability in a controlled setting, the experiments will provide an unprecedented, high-resolution three-dimensional map of a dynamic magnetosphere. This will advance our fundamental understanding of space weather by investigating magnetic reconnection, a key process that can drive geomagnetic storms that pose extreme hazards to human activities in space. The project will utilize the LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles and includes a collaboration with the Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal. The project also provides advanced training and mentorship opportunity to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them for the STEM workforce. Magnetospheres are a ubiquitous feature of magnetized bodies embedded in a plasma flow. In planetary magnetospheres, a key process driving magnetospheric dynamics is magnetic reconnection, in which magnetic energy is explosively released when opposing magnetic field lines merge and annihilate. In space environments, this reconnection is collisionless and controlled by kinetic-scale plasma physics. Mini-magnetospheres, small ion-scale structures that are well-suited to studying kinetic-scale physics, provide a unique environment for studying magnetospheric reconnection that can be created in the laboratory. This project will create ion-scale magnetospheres by coupling a supersonic, laser-driven plasma flow with a dipole magnet embedded in the uniform, magnetized plasma of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles. Leveraging the high-repetition and reproducible capabilities of the platform and high-fidelity 3D numerical simulations, the objectives of the project are to 1) develop a novel 3D Thomson scattering diagnostic for measuring key plasma parameters in mini-magnetosphere experiments; 2) measure for the first time the magnetic reconnection rate in both dayside and magnetotail configurations through highly-resolved, volumetric datasets; and 3) investigate how magnetic reconnection impacts the global structure of the magnetosphere. The laboratory measurements will help validate numerical simulations and magnetospheric models, as well as complement spacecraft observations of mini-magnetospheres such as those associated with small moons, comets, and lunar magnetic anomalies.

The Parity Violating Electron Scattering Program of Louisiana Tech University,"A central goal of subatomic physics is to understand comprehensively the basic ""building blocks"" of matter and how they interact. Since its formulation nearly five decades ago, the “Standard Model” of nuclear and particle physics has been remarkably successful and allows us to describe many physical phenomena. It is known, however, to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons why the Standard Model should eventually break down and fail to describe some properties of matter. Precise measurements using electron accelerators present an opportunity to test the Standard Model and to search for new physics. The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, Virginia is currently the world's leading laboratory enabling precise tests of the Standard Model through electron scattering experiments. This project will support an effort to determine precisely the weak charge of the electron by using a large collaborative experiment, known as MOLLER, to perform two novel experiments to understand quark-antiquark pairs that are part of the proton's virtual ""sea quarks"" and also how nucleons behave within the nucleus. Louisiana Tech University is located in a rural area of Northern Louisiana. In recent years, all of the surrounding universities have eliminated their physics departments, leaving the Louisiana Tech program as the only physics undergraduate or graduate program available in Northern Louisiana. The group’s commitment to the involvement of undergraduates in research is vital for the physics program. The NSF funding will enable underrepresented groups from several disciplines, science teachers, and high school students to participate in forefront nuclear physics research. The Louisiana Tech University nuclear physics group will collaborate with other US and International groups to design, build, and commission parity-violating electron scattering experiments. The main goals of the group’s work will be to design and develop two charge particle detection systems, design an electron detector for a polarimeter, design radiation shielding measures, and develop a theoretical interpretation of the electron scattering experiments. In addition, the group will finish publishing the results from a prior electron scattering experiment at Jefferson Lab. The group will contribute to the MOLLER experiment two newly proposed experiments as spokespersons, and the Qweak experiment.

Charge transfer exciton dynamics at diamond-hBN interface,"Nontechnical description Interfaces between dissimilar materials such as diamond and boron nitride offer exciting possibilities for realizing exceptional electronic, optical, magnetic, and chemical properties. In this project, the research team explores these possibilities by studying the interaction of charges at the interface between diamond and hexagonal boron nitride. This boundary can be finely tuned by altering the chemical composition at the surface of the diamond, the number of boron nitride layers, and the angle at which these materials meet, providing broad design flexibility. The team uses this tunability to investigate how bound pairs of excited electrons and their corresponding positively charged empty states, which are known as excitons, form, relax, and move across the interface. The researchers employ advanced optical techniques and theoretical calculations to understand the unknown behavior of these excitons, focusing on how their dynamics change with temperature and modifications to the structure. This research could pave the way for new applications in energy conversion, optoelectronics, and microelectronics. Additionally, the project provides valuable training for graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge experimental and computational methods. To address education at the grassroot level, the team in collaboration with Museum of Natural History at University of Michigan will engage middle school students in scientific research via curriculum development and summer programs. Technical description Van der Waals semiconductor heterointerfaces present an opportunity to develop new classes of material systems with superior electronic, optical, magnetic and chemical properties. In this project, the research team theoretically and experimentally investigates the charge transfer excitons at the diamond-hexagonal boron nitride heterointerface. This interface provides immense design flexibility of the heterointerface due to the band alignment tunability via surface passivation of diamond, number of boron nitride layers, and orientation twist angle between the two materials. The research team utilizes this tunability to explore the formation/relaxation dynamics and transport properties of charge transfer excitons. They employ advanced optical spectroscopy, along with guidance from first-principles calculations, to unravel the unknown physics associated with charge-transfer excitons, and specifically their thermalization dynamics and transport dynamics as a function of temperature to reveal the potential pathways to control it. The tightly weaved experiment-theory effort is imperative for the development of a potential excitonic material system to serve applications in energy conversion, optoelectronic, and micro-electronics. The energy transfer and transport associated with charge-transfer excitons combining diamond and boron nitride remains an unexplored territory of research and thus, presents a unique opportunity to develop a new class of material systems for opto-excitonics. By combining two quantum ready scalable systems, the research team aims to establish diamond/boron nitride interfaces as a platform for room temperature excitonic devices. The project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art experimental and computational techniques. The topic of two-dimensional semiconductors is particularly well suited to introduce a wide range of nanotechnology-related themes. Thus, the research-team will engage in curriculum development and summer programs for middle school students in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History at University of Michigan.

New Horizons in Quantum Nuclear X-ray Optics,"Modern quantum metrology, quantum communication, and quantum simulation currently depend on infrared or optical photons and their resonant interactions with atoms. However, higher frequency X-ray radiation could benefit these applications, due to lower noise levels, higher phase sensitivities, tighter focusing, broader bandwidths and, accordingly, higher temporal resolution and faster processing. Nuclear ensembles resonantly interacting with X-ray radiation also have some additional advantages. Their resonant transitions are less sensitive to perturbations by electric and magnetic fields, due to the tiny size of a nucleus compared to an atom. Additionally, in contrast to atomic transitions, spectrally narrow nuclear transitions are available even at room temperature and high solid-state densities. These benefits hold promise for building compact, room-temperature, solid-state nuclear clocks that could outperform atomic clocks both in terms of accuracy and stability. Such clocks could redefine the standards of time and other measurement units and be used in searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model, including searches for dark matter and potential time-dependence of fundamental constants. Applications for such clocks could also include navigation, chronometric geodesy, geology, seismology and climatology. Narrow nuclear resonances in solids could lead to the realization of compact and long-lived nuclear quantum memories, which would be useful for long-distance quantum communication and synchronization of quantum information networks. Postdocs and graduate students participating in this project will be trained in the highly interdisciplinary field of quantum nuclear X-ray optics, learning experimental, analytical, and numerical techniques. They will get an opportunity to participate in experiments at world-class synchrotron and X-ray free electron laser facilities, such as the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Recent research by the PI’s team and their collaborators led to (i) pioneering resonant excitation of the Sc-45 nuclear isomer, establishing this isomer as one of the primary candidates for nuclear clocks and (ii) the first demonstration of a quantum nuclear memory for X-ray photons. The latter was based on the Doppler Nuclear Frequency Comb protocol suggested by the PI’s team. Building on that success, the current project aims at further breakthroughs in this field. It consists of two mutually related parts. 1. The first observation of coherent forward scattering in a Sc-45 sample, i.e., time-dependent collective coherent decay of the nuclear polariton resonantly excited by a train of X-ray pulses. This would allow a measurement of the linewidth (coherence time) of the nuclear transition. The linewidth is expected to be orders of magnitude narrower than any other nuclear transition explored so far. It could allow for a measurement of the gravitational red shift at record-small displacements. 2. The first demonstration of an on-demand quantum nuclear memory. Three different protocols will be explored for this purpose: (i) introducing a magnetic field gradient and switching its sign, (ii) switching the velocity directions in the Doppler Nuclear Frequency Comb memory, and (iii) switching the direction of the magnetic field in nuclear absorbers with multiple Zeeman sublevels. The team will also develop new techniques for shaping X-ray waveforms at the single photon level, which is required for achieving a high-fidelity and high-efficiency quantum memory. Interferometric phase measurements and photon statistics measurements of the original, and newly developed, sources of X-ray photons will also be performed.

Epitaxial engineering of layered magnetic pnictides,"Non-technical Abstract: Efficient high-density data storage technology relies on our ability to sense and manipulate electrons. The past decade witnessed the discovery the magnetic topological insulators, a class of materials where the spin of electrons is locked to the direction of their motion. This property has been exploited to design efficient data storage devices utilizing unique magnetic properties. The project aims to design, synthesize and study a new class of topological materials, where the interaction of magnetism with electrons enables new electrical and optical properties. These properties can become the foundation for new means of sensing information that can be exploited in next-generation optical detectors and novel devices. The research activities under this project support the training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students to acquire highly sought-after skills needed to advance the materials and semiconductor workforce of the future. The findings stemming from those research activities are disseminated to a non-expert audience through public library of activities and through social media outreach. Technical Abstract: Layered magnetic pnictides from the EuX2(As,P)2 family (X=In, Mn) are antiferromagnets that can either be topological (X=In) or correlated (X=Mn) insulators. They have recently been studied as single crystals but have yet to be grown as wafer-scale films, necessary for a variety of measurements and applications. This project employs molecular beam epitaxy to achieve the synthesis of thin films of layered magnetic pnictides. Using knobs enabled by epitaxial synthesis, the research team aims to carry out a systematic tuning of the magnetic and electronic properties of these materials. An initial research activity examines how chemical alloying, strain and quantum confinement impact the helimagnetic state of EuIn2As2 and its electronic properties. A specific type of alloying with Mn on the In site is sought to bring a topological and a correlated state into coexistence. A second activity aims to identify manifestations of Berry curvature and quantum geometric phases in the resonant infrared response of EuX2(As,P)2 films through magnetooptical and photovoltaic measurements. Lastly, the project aims to search for a quantized anomalous Hall state by electrically gating EuIn2As2¬ films engineered to be insulating in the bulk. The project synergizes these research tasks with a strong educational component that includes the training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students on tools that are valuable to quantum material science and the semiconductor industry. One of those researchers is recruited from a neighboring women’s college and participates in experiments on site and at user facilities. The findings and discoveries made through this project are partly disseminated to the general public through public library lectures and social media broadcasts.

Ultra-Low Noise Cryogenic Environment for Quantum Science,"The goal of this proposal is to build a one-of-a-kind tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms limiting coherence in the solid state (both at material and device level), reducing external disturbances as much as pos-sible, and creating an ideal environment to explore new concepts in fundamental physics. We will purchase a commercial dilution refrigerator and customize it for suppressing mechanical vibrations, residual magnetic fields, and electromagnetic noise. The fridge, with a base temperature below 10 mK and scanning probe capa-cilities, will be installed in a world-class noise-free laboratory, currently fully operational at IBM Research. The environment of the noise-free laboratory will further ensure temperature stability, acoustic isolation, me-chanical isolation and clean electrical signals. This approach will result in a truly unique system worldwide for fundamental studies of quantum devices and phenomena via electrical and scanning probe techniques, and for addressing ultimate limits of quantum coherence in the solid-state. This equipment will become central to the Swiss research landscape, where a significant number of scientists investigate coherence in quantum systems. In particular, understanding and mitigating sources of decoherence in qubits will likely be a primary topic of research for the next decade.The facility will be hosted at the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center and will be coherently shared between three research groups at IBM Research working on quantum devices and scanning probe experiments. Furthermore, its usage will be granted to collaborators and interested scientists outside of IBM Research. We conceived a modular design, where sample holders can be easily exchanged according to the need of the exper-imentalists. The dilution fridge will be equipped with three measurement pods, allowing three simultaneous ex-periments in the frequency range from DC to 18 GHz. Two pods will be dedicated to electrical measurements of quantum devices and qubits, one pod will be dedicated to scanning probe experiments. Building on the strengths at IBM Research, this measurement system will combine unique capabilities and ena-ble new experiments in several fields of research, currently under intense investigation in Switzerland. In the field of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, it will enable studies of quasiparticle poisoning and decoherence of superconducting spin qubits, as well as realization of synthetic topological matter based on microwave measurement of flux-tunable Josephson junctions. In the field of spin qubits, it will allow us to test qubit coherence in the absence of magnetic field fluctuations. This, together with isotopic purification of the qubit host material, will provide precious information on intrinsic sources of decoherence, which are known to exist, but are yet to be fully understood. Experiments in a large magnetic field will be possible by installing an ultra-stable permanent magnet cooled to 10 mK, when needed. Scanning probe experiments, which are typical-ly challenging in a cryogen-free system, will benefit from the level of mechanical stability we seek to achieve. Enabling scanning probe microscopy and scanning SQUID microscopy at mK temperatures, with enhanced spatial and measurement resolution, will make this tool strategic to investigate quantum devices and sources of decoherence on surfaces. Among the unique features of our system will be an additional helium vessel, or “heli-um battery”. The helium battery will allow operation for a few hours with the pulse tube turned off, resulting in a unique benchmark for qubit operation in an environment completely free of vibrations and magnetic fields. Overall, the system we propose will be both a unique and an essential tool in the fast-developing field of quan-tum technology. Technical and scientific knowledge gained by our work will be pivotal for a new understanding of decoherence mechanisms in the solid state and guide research towards better qubits.",581035,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Expanding the reach of GREENBURST --- searching for the brightest pulses in the Universe and the slowest rotating neutron stars in the Galaxy,"A research program called GREENBURST led by scientists at West Virginia University (WVU) will use radio observations at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to study transient astrophysical objects within and beyond the Milky Way. The populations probed by this proposal are: (i) fast radio bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances; and (ii) ultra-long period pulsars in the Galaxy. Using well-established techniques to search for single pulses and artificial intelligence to combat rising levels of terrestrial radio interference, this project will expand the capabilities of GREENBURST to allow it to sample pulses with widths between 10 nanoseconds and 10 seconds. Two graduate students will be supported by this work and develop highly transferrable skills in data analysis, machine learning, and digital signal processing. In addition, several focused outreach activities will benefit from this work. A K–12 outreach talk describing the science behind the project will be developed by the PIs and students as a new feature presentation in the West Virginia Science Public Outreach Team (SPOT) program. A group of 16 undergraduate student ambassadors will receive training on the presentation and science communication from SPOT and will reach around 32 schools each year. In addition, a short planetarium feature on GREENBURST will be developed at WVU, expected to reach 10,000 members of the local community each year. GREENBURST will be used to carry out four specific projects over a three-year period: two survey projects and two source characterization projects. The first survey is a census of FRBs in nearby galaxies with the GBT. This project uses dedicated time on the telescope and has sufficient sensitivity to target galaxies in which dozens of pulses from FRBs are expected over the duration of the survey. The second survey is a commensal project that searches for ultra-long period (much greater than one second) Galactic sources whenever the GBT is in use. Galactic pulsar-like sources with periods as long as several hours will also be probed through the detection of single pulses. One of the characterization projects targets known repeating FRBs with the goal of finding more examples of so-called “ultrafast” FRB pulses which have recently been shown to exist. The final project synthesizes all the known pulsar detections from GREENBURST to provide a comprehensive census of single-pulse emission which will allow strong constraints on the distribution of giant pulses from Galactic millisecond pulsars, an area of research that is currently poorly understood.

CAREER: Multiconfigurational Methods for Modeling Quantum Sensors and Open Transport Systems,"Dr. Erik Hoy of Rowan University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop comprehensive methodologies that facilitate the design of molecular-scale quantum electric and magnetic field sensors. By measuring minute changes in the quantum states of a system, molecular-scale quantum sensors could provide a level of sensitivity and precision far beyond that of current technologies, with the potential to revolutionize sensing technology in areas ranging from medical imaging to GPS navigation. Obtaining that level of sensitivity and precision, however, requires designing molecular-scale quantum sensors with multiple interacting and long-lived quantum states. To achieve this, Dr. Hoy and his research group will develop comprehensive quantum methodologies for describing multi-state quantum dynamics in single-molecule-scale sensors. These methods will generate the insights needed to create realizable molecular quantum sensor designs that are sensitive enough to detect a single charge interacting with a single sensor. To build the national quantum workforce needed to translate these sensor designs into practical devices, Dr. Hoy will create a multi-level educational program to train undergraduate and community college students to become the next generation of quantum scientists. The key impediment to developing practical molecular quantum sensors with single charge sensitivity is maintaining long-lived coherence in an entangled molecular-scale sensor. Resolving this issue requires a thorough understanding of the dynamics of coherent electronic states. To accurately model coherent electronic states and ensure consistent agreement with experimental results, open quantum transport methodologies with a robust description of multireference electron correlation are required. However, current open quantum transport methods are limited either by their descriptions of electron interactions or the use of a linear response formalism which limits the accuracy of quantum simulations for open systems. To address both limitations, Dr. Hoy and his research group will develop time-dependent nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) implementations for open quantum systems incorporating multiconfigurational molecular electronic structure methods based on pair density functional theories. These multiconfigurational NEGF methods will be used to design molecular-scale quantum sensors with both high sensitivity and long-lived electronic coherence. In addition, to enhance the national quantum workforce, Erik Hoy will develop new low-cost computational clusters and corresponding educational materials for teaching high-performance computing skills in chemistry courses and host interactive computational nanoscience workshops and seminars for undergraduates and community college students in South Jersey.

The materials are studied by imaging the propagation of sound waves through them to determine key properties such as viscosity and diffusion. The project will take advantage of international free electron laser user facilities and will focus on materials such as iron alloys and silicates commonly present in planetary cores. The project will combine these experimental measurements with computational and theoretical methods to develop a comprehensive understanding of the many-body physics within strongly coupled plasmas, with impacts on materials research, studies of planetary evolution, nuclear stockpile stewardship, and potential fusion energy development. The project will also provide year-round research experience for undergraduate students, equipping them with skills in computational physics, data analysis, and experimental techniques.

Spectroscopy of Carbocations and Molecular Ionic Clusters in He Droplets,"With support from the Chemical Structure and Dynamics (CSD) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrey Vilesov of the University of Southern California is investigating carbocations and molecular ionic clusters embedded in helium droplets at the ultracold temperature of 0.4 K via infrared spectroscopy. The structural information of cations and radicals is key to understanding their participation in chemical reactions, but exploration of these species is challenging because of their high reactivity and low concentration in a typical experiment. Weak interactions between helium atoms and ions make helium nanodroplets a unique matrix for the isolation and vibrational spectroscopy of ions. Professor Vilesov’s group will generate different carbocations and ionic clusters in helium droplets from neutral precursors by electron impact ionization. The resulting ions will be studied by mid-infrared laser spectroscopy and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer will enable simultaneous detection of the spectra of multiple ions. Their studies may provide insights into the structures of carbocation isomers and radical-cation clusters and could have broad implications to radiation chemistry and astrochemistry. This project will be performed by a diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students who will gain experience in modern physical chemistry experimentation and data analysis. This project is focused on the elucidation of the structures of carbocations and molecular ionic clusters by isolating them in helium droplets at the ultralow temperature of 0.4 K. The droplets will be doped with molecules and ionized via electron impact producing embedded ions, which will be studied by laser spectroscopy in the mid-infrared range. These studies will contribute to a better understanding of the isomers of important carbocations, including C4H7+ and C7H11+, uncover the structures of radical-cation clusters such as (NH3)n+, and explore the products of ion-molecular reactions at ultralow temperature. The broader impact of this work involves gaining further understanding of radiation chemistry in the condensed phase and determining potential cationic intermediates necessary to produce aromatic and large organic molecules in the interstellar medium. This project will provide opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students by developing and performing cutting-edge physical chemistry experiments and preparing ensuing publications.

"CAREER: Geometric Quantum Order: Fractons, Tensor Gauge Theories and Beyond","NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports joint theoretical research and education to advance the theoretical foundations of condensed matter physics. Condensed matter physics concerns itself with systems composed of a large number of interacting constituents. Materials are a common example as they contain many atoms and many electrons. It is common to think of such complex systems not in terms of the individual constituents, but rather in terms of properties that emerge from their collective behavior. The concept of phases of matter is an important example of a collective property. Systems that show the same phase have similar properties. Ferromagnets have the collective property that the constituent atoms or electrons align in such a way that the magnetic axis of each one points in the same direction. Ferromagnets made of different materials are all ferromagnets. However, a ferromagnet is qualitatively different from an antiferromagnetic phase in which the magnetic axis of one atom points in the direction opposite that of its neighbor. So, systems that belong to the same phase have similar qualitative properties, while systems that belong to different phases have different properties. When quantum mechanics mingles with strong interactions among constituents very strange phases can emerge, such as the topological phases of the fractional quantum Hall effect; the latter occurs when electrons confined to a two-dimension plane by semiconductors are exposed to an intense magnetic field. Recently proposed fracton phases of matter are another turning point in this development. These phases have the interesting and distinct property of being hypersensitive to the geometry of the underlying material, for example the way atoms are organized on a lattice, as well as the presence of geometric distortions of the lattice. The PI will undertake a careful study and characterization of these phases, which necessitates the development new concepts and new theoretical tools. New tools will help advance understanding of the physical properties of fracton phases as well as suggest routes for experimental detection of fractions in materials. This is fundamental research; however, fractons could play an important role in developing quantum memory, and suggest new ways to think about quantum computing. Finally, it is already becoming clear that some fracton phenomena may have been discovered long ago in superfluids and liquid crystals, without realizing that these are but a page of a much bigger story. The PI will utilize the new techniques developed in the fracton context to gain new insights into the problems of vortices in superconductors, turbulence, and quantum liquid crystals. The education component of this CAREER project includes training undergraduate and graduate students. Students will explore how to use machine learning methods to gain insight into theoretical problems. The PI will participate in global efforts to increase diversity in physics through mentoring undergraduate students who are members of underrepresented groups leveraging American Physical Society initiatives. The PI will engage in outreach in local high schools by participating in career days and encouraging students to study science. PI will develop a course aimed at undergraduate and graduate students that will focus on applications of condensed matter physics ideas to deep neural networks. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports joint theoretical research and education to advance the theoretical foundations of strongly correlated topological and geometric phases of matter. The project is focused on the physics of systems that support emergent fracton excitations. These excitations possess two remarkable properties: (i) they are topologically non-trivial and (ii) they cannot freely move through space. The constraints on their motion arise dynamically, while the underlying physical system is translation invariant. More concretely the research concentrated on three major efforts. (i) Fracton excitations can emerge in gapless correlated spin liquids. The PI will explore how the existence of these excitations affects observable properties of these systems. (ii) The constrained mobility of fracton excitations can be formally imposed by introducing additional symmetries. The variety of all possible mobility constraints roughly corresponds to all possible symmetries of this kind. The PI will develop a general theory of such symmetries and their manifestation in low energy properties of the physical systems constrained by these symmetries. (iii) A particular form of fracton behavior is already present in well-known systems such as superfluids, liquid crystals and quantum Hall states, where vortices, crystalline defects and composite fermions have a subtle version of constrained motion. The PI will investigate this tantalizing connection with the expectation that fracton machinery will provide a fresh look at these systems. The education component of this CAREER project includes training undergraduate and graduate students. Students will explore how to use machine learning methods to gain insight into theoretical problems. The PI will participate in global efforts to increase diversity in physics through mentoring undergraduate students who are members of underrepresented groups leveraging American Physical Society initiatives. The PI will engage in outreach in local high schools by participating in career days and encouraging students to study science. PI will develop a course aimed at undergraduate and graduate students that will focus on applications of condensed matter physics ideas to deep neural networks.

Entanglement theory in networks,"Quantum communication technologies have the potential to radically impact the current Information Age. Quantum networks provide a backbone for this new information paradigm, and are being developed rapidly both at national and continental scales. Current and near-term implementations of quantum networks typically involve photonic links and multiple independent sources that each distribute bipartite entanglement to distant nodes. To ``stitch'' together these independent pieces of bipartite entanglement, each node jointly processes its received quantum systems. As a result, a global multipartite entangled state is generated across the entire network, which in turn can be used for tasks like quantum communication, distributed computing or sensing.  Forming a general understanding of multipartite entanglement in such networks is a key challenge. Importantly, the standard theory of entanglement is only of limited relevance here, as it relies on a model that fundamentally differs from how current-and near-term networks behave. In traditional entanglement theory one usually considers a single quantum source distributing entanglement to distant parties, who then perform post-processing via arbitrary rounds of local operation and classical communication. In contrast, realistic networks feature multiple separated quantum sources each distributing just bipartite entanglement, followed by immediate local processing at the nodes without rounds of classical interaction. This motivates the development of a novel theory of entanglement tailored to quantum networks.  The main goal of this proposed work is to advance such a theory.  Our project is structured along two main research lines. In WP1 we aim to characterize the structure of multipartite entanglement in networks. The key questions are: which entangled states can be generated in a network? How can we efficiently certify multipartite entanglement in networks? How can one quantify network entanglement in an operationally meaningful way? In WP2 we explore the properties of quantum measurements at each network node.  The fundamental questions we will explore are: what type of local measurements are possible when multiple quantum signals are received at different times and quantum memory is limited?  What classes of multipartite entangled states can be generated under constrained entanglement swapping measurements? How do restricted local measurements lead to novel notions of network quantum steering and data hiding?  A key approach of our project is to remain as close as possible to experimental capabilities, and to develop methods and protocols that are of direct relevance to current and near-term quantum network implementations.   This research program addresses challenging questions whose solutions will require the joint expertise and collaborative effort of the two PIs. Eric Chitambar brings expertise in quantum entanglement and resource theories, and Nicolas Brunner in quantum correlations and measurements. We expect strong complementarity and synergies between the PIs and their teams. By developing a general understanding of the capabilities and limitations for entanglement generation in realistic quantum networks, we expect to significantly advance the theory of entanglement and impact the development of quantum networks.",571794,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Collaborative Research: Enabling direct imaging radio telescopes and precision cosmology with pyFHD,"A new generation of large radio telescopes are being developed to study how and when the first stars and galaxies formed, understand our evolving universe, and explain the behavior of our sun and solar system. These telescopes will have many more antennas than previous radio telescopes. A new technique has been developed to significantly reduce the data rates from such large telescopes. Under this grant, the investigators will add functionality to the open source pyFHD software package. The investigators will test this software with data collected from several radio telescopes including both traditional and direct imaging systems. These software enhancements will be made widely available to the entire radio astronomy community, facilitating and encouraging additional contributions to the package. In addition, this grant will support EPIC TV, giving the public a real-time view of the radio sky as seen by the Long Wavelength Array in New Mexico. This project will provide research experiences for non-traditional undergraduate students that are not well served by standard research opportunities. This will include enabling these students on a path to graduate school, with a goal to diversify the broader STEM workforce. Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD) was developed in the 21cm cosmology community that solves many of the analysis challenges encountered in that research area. It has been used in obtaining leading limits of the 21cm Epoch of Reionization power spectrum, demonstrating that it has the precision required for cosmology, as well as being used to make high-quality catalogs and polarized maps of galactic emission. FHD, originally written in IDL (the Interactive Data Language), shares a mathematical framework with direct imaging, making it well placed to help address the data analysis challenges for direct imaging telescopes. Recently, in a major development effort, the minimal set of FHD functionality required for a standard cosmology analysis was ported to python, resulting in the open source pyFHD package. The functionality the investigators will develop in pyFHD under this grant will enable the community to demonstrate the science performance of direct imaging radio telescopes with a full end-to-end pipeline. This will provide the community with a reference implementation of the software needed to perform science without interferometric visibilities and will facilitate evaluation for future proposals to construct direct imaging radio telescopes.

Neutrino Physics at Oregon State,"Neutrino Physics at Oregon State The DUNE experiment that will begin taking data late in this decade consists of three major components, a powerful neutrino beam, near detectors located at Fermilab to monitor the beam and enormous Liquid Argon detectors now being assembled in the Homestake mine in South Dakota. The combination of the near and far detectors will allow precision measurements of CP violation in the neutrino sector starting early in the next decade. This award will develop a prototype open data access systems for DUNE data in preparation for first astrophysical data near the end of this decade. The emphasis of this system will be on atmospheric and solar neutrinos and potential supernova candidates. DUNE is sensitive to electron neutrinos from supernovae through the interaction of electron neutrinos in Liquid Argon. These interactions will be of immediate interest to the broad scientific community and the general public. This award will develop a prototype data access system that will allow public distribution of data from DUNE supernova and solar neutrino candidates. The prototype will have real data from the ProtoDUNE experiment and simulated supernova interactions to test the delivery system and allow non-collaborators to perform simple analysis of real data. The award will also allow further work on data analysis for the ProtoDUNE test runs at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The prototype access system will allow DUNE collaborators, other scientists, students, and the general public to learn about neutrino physics and astrophysics using real data and test methods for analyzing data. The prototype will lead to a full-scale system that will make these valuable data accessible to the public for reanalysis and for use in education. For example, the raw data arrives as digitized waveforms, finding neutrino signals in those data can introduce students to modern signal-processing and statistical techniques.

Molecular color centers in a carbon host for spin qubits,"Nontechnical description Quantum information science exploits the laws of quantum mechanics and has the potential to produce fascinating technologies that would impact many aspects of our lives. In analogy to the classical binary bits used in today’s information technology, the fundamental unit in quantum information science is the so-called quantum bits (or qubits), which are coherent superposition of quantum mechanical states. This research aims to deepen current understanding of electron spins in low-dimensional materials and develop material design principles that could lead to new types of qubits. The research project provides multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the areas of material science and quantum optics. It also serves as an exciting opportunity for the training of our next-generation workforce in quantum information science. Technical description The goal of the proposed research is to develop a material design principle for creating spin-active quantum defects in a one-dimensional host and explore their potential for spin qubits. In the first stage of the proposed work, the research team will focus on the design and fundamental studies of the quantum defects. In particular, the team will investigate the influences of the defects’ atomic structures and chemical compositions on their spin manifolds and coherence properties, with the goal of obtaining general design principles that govern spin properties. Quantum operations of the spin qubits will be carried out after the initial design and optimization of the defect structures.

Using the Higgs Boson as a Tool to Search for New Physics at ATLAS,"This award will provide support to a Northern Illinois University team working on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC, which smashes pairs of protons together and ATLAS, a large particle detector, perform basic scientific research at the world's largest energies and smallest distances. One of the key goals of the ATLAS experiment is placing the Higgs boson, the last major piece of current particle physics theories to be discovered, under a microscope, in order to compare its properties to predictions from theory. In particular, this award will study Higgs bosons that decay into a pair of photons in order to search for new particles and production of pairs of Higgs bosons from a single proton-proton collision. The award will also enable the future ATLAS physics program at the HL-LHC, for which the experiment will receive significantly more proton-proton collisions at a time. The NIU group will focus on tracking (determining the trajectory of charged particles) for the HL-LHC trigger system, which will be responsible for rapidly deciding which data to record and which data can safely be rejected. As part of the award, the NIU team will also contribute significant outreach to K-12 students, teachers and the general public. The team will participate in an NIU QuarkNet center, and also continue its popular Physics of Sports lecture series for the general public.

RUI: Studies of Nucleon Structure at Jefferson Lab,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons (protons and neutrons) are made up of more elementary constituents - quarks and gluons. The main physics program supported by this award aims to study the internal structure of the proton and neutron. More specifically, this research group will scatter electrons from protons and neutrons at Jefferson Laboratory to measure the electric and magnetic properties of the nucleon. The group is involved in these efforts through the design of new experiments, the construction of advanced particle detectors, and the development of novel analysis, modeling, and data acquisition software. The faculty involve students in research by providing meaningful, substantive projects to both undergraduate and graduate students. The group’s long established program of experiments embody Jefferson Lab’s fundamental mission: to elucidate the underlying structure of protons, neutrons, and mesons. They focus on experiments that will further our understanding of the quark spin structure of the proton and neutron in the non-perturbative regime. Jefferson Lab’s high-intensity polarized 12 GeV electron beam provides the opportunity for an increased physics reach; indeed, the group continues to lead efforts to extend the measurements of the proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors to the highest momentum transfers possible at Jefferson Lab, and also investigate possible modification of the proton form factor ratio within the nuclear medium. These experiments provide severe tests of the available theoretical models of nucleon structure, and at the same time serve as an impetus for the development of new and more advanced models based on Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD).

"Lunar structure and formation: A joint geophysical, geochemical and mineral physics approach","Geochemical and petrological analyses of returned samples have led to the notion that the Moon, shortly after its formation, was covered by a magma ocean caused by a giant impact with a Mars-sized body. While a consensus surrounding lunar formation has emerged, the nature of the material that coalesced to form the Moon remains to be established. The Moon is suggested to have a terrestrial origin based on compositional and isotopic similarities with the Earth. Yet, this is in general contradiction with dynamical models of a giant impact that indicate that much of the material that coalesced to form the Moon originated from the impactor. Our ability to discern between these possibilities is hampered by the lack of direct geophysical sampling of the lunar core, the uncertainty in translating its physical properties to compositional information, and the simplifying assumption of a homogeneous lunar mantle. At present, it is therefore not possible to determine, neither by geophysical nor by geochemical approaches, the bulk composition of the Moon and hence its genetic relationship to the Earth. This unsatisfactory situation stands to be changed with the upcoming Farside Seismic Suite (FSS) mission to the Moon that seeks to deploy a seismometer on the surface of the lunar farside. Since the Apollo lunar landings and the recent highly successful Mars InSight mission, which has significantly advanced our understanding of the interior structure, formation, and evolution of Mars, FSS will be the next mission dedicated to acquiring seismic data in-situ to explore the internal structure of a planetary body. This proposal aims to build a project that brings together all components required for a comprehensive investigation of the internal structure and composition of the Moon. We propose an integrated and comprehensive approach that joins observational seismology, geophysics, geochemistry, and experimental mineral physics in a unique collaborative framework. More specifically, we propose to 1) re-evaluate the Apollo lunar seismic data for core properties (size, state, and composition) relying partly on the methods developed and the lessons learned from analysis of the seismic data from InSight; 2) develop a workflow for data analysis from FSS; and 3) combine geophysical data across disciplines (seismology, tides, gravity) to build self-consistent models of the lunar interior. In combination herewith and to determine whether the Moon is merely Earth-like in an isotopic sense, or whether it comes from the same material, we propose to 4) collect new, high-precision data for Mo and Sn abundances using double-spike MC-ICP-MS in a wide variety of lunar igneous rocks, with a special emphasis on mare magmatic products; 5) determine densities of liquid Fe-rich alloys as a function of temperature that will provide the basis for thermodynamic models accounting for the effect of temperature and pressure on the densities of lunar core-forming metal alloys.  For this purpose, we assemble three research groups working on structure and evolution of terrestrial planets in a single integrated research unit. The project consists of two interconnected PhD modules that commence ahead of the launch of FSS to allow for a preparatory science phase based on the Apollo lunar seismic data to build the required skills for immediate analysis and interpretation of the data. As with InSight, FSS presents a unique opportunity for implementing an interdisciplinary and integrated approach that fuses seismology and large-scale geophysics with major and minor element geochemisty to constrain bulk composition, thermal state, core size and composition of the Moon.",569430,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; United States,Switzerland,Earth Sciences; Geochemistry; Geology; Geophysics; Space Sciences
Observational Investigations of the Scaling of Ion Heating by Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail,"As the Earth orbits the Sun in our vast solar system, it is immersed in the solar wind plasma, a fast flow of charged particles continuously streaming away from the Sun. The solar wind compresses the Earth’s dipole magnetic field on the dayside and pulls it into a magnetic tail on the nightside, just like the tail of a comet. In this long and stretched magnetic tail, an explosive process called magnetic reconnection is prevalent. This process converts the magnetic energy in the stretched magnetic tail into particle jets and heating of the ambient plasma. Sometimes the heating is low, and sometimes it is very high. In this project, hundreds of reconnection jets in the Earth’s magnetotail will be studied using in-situ spacecraft observations to find out what controls the degree of the plasma heating. The results will contribute to understanding how particles are energized and the plasma is heated during magnetic reconnection in other astrophysical and laboratory environments, and will help to understand and predict the drivers of the space weather on Earth. Magnetic reconnection is a universal plasma process which converts stored magnetic energy into particle energies. One of the key unresolved questions in reconnection research is what controls the degree of ion heating in reconnection. Past observational studies of ion and electron heating scaling in reconnection have focused on the low heating regimes of the magnetopause and the solar wind. These studies have found that both ion and electron heating in reconnection are linearly proportional to the available magnetic energy per particle. However, independent observational and theoretical studies have suggested that the linear dependence of ion heating may not be universal. To test the universality of the linear scaling of ion heating, observations of reconnection in the high heating regime are required. The Earth’s magnetotail provides a natural laboratory in the high heating regime where in-situ spacecraft can observe reconnection in action. This project will conduct a comprehensive study using spacecraft observations of reconnection in the Earth’s magnetotail to establish the characteristics and controlling factors of ion heating.

Understanding quantum emergent phenomena in Shastry-Sutherland model systems,"Non-Technical Abstract: Magnetic frustrated systems offer a captivating exploration of physics, where diverse forces prevent the formation of a simple magnetically ordered pattern, leading to various quantum states, from exotic spin patterns to superconductors. The Shastry-Sutherland Lattice (SSL) model plays a crucial role in interpreting quantum magnetism, offering insights into transitions under different conditions, such as pressure and magnetic field, resulting in the formation of novel magnetic patterns. Understanding these phenomena isn't just about uncovering the mysteries of the universe; it's about shaping the future of technology, as in the realm of spintronics, where these insights can drive innovative advancements. For instance, leveraging the principles of spintronics can enable the development of more efficient electronic devices. This could mean faster and more energy-efficient computers, as well as improved communication devices, significantly enhancing the way we connect and process information. Inspired by SSL model breakthroughs, this proposal suggests exploring a new family of similar compounds to deepen our understanding and propel technological progress. The project focuses on practical research, including synthesizing materials, conducting experiments to measure thermodynamic properties, and employing advanced scattering techniques for further insights. Beyond the scientific aspects, the project places emphasis on education, involving graduate and undergraduate students and fostering diversity in science. Collaboration between different institutions is actively encouraged, promoting participation in educational programs and internships to contribute to the broader scientific community. Technical Abstract: The initial realization of the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice (SSL) model in SrCu2(BO3)2 (SCBO) unveils a complex phase diagram, particularly in the study of magnetization plateaus under high magnetic fields and the potential hosting of topological triplons. However, understanding these emergent states in SCBO poses challenges due to technical experimental obstacles, such as the need for high magnetic fields and high pressures at low temperatures. In response, this research focuses on a new rare-earth-based SSL model family of compounds, allowing for more accessible investigations of field- and pressure-induced phenomena. The research plan includes synthesis, in-house thermodynamics measurements, and advanced spectroscopy experiments in collaboration with national user facilities. Ongoing collaboration with expert theorists provides crucial analysis and interpretation of the experimental results.

Charge-Spin Conversions and Nonreciprocal Transport in Chiral Materials,"Non-technical Abstract: Semiconductor microelectronics is at the heart of today’s information technologies and indispensable for many other utilities. Conventional semiconductor microelectronics utilize only the charge of electrons. It has been demonstrated that harnessing the spin, or the intrinsic magnetic property, of electrons can not only greatly enhance the performance, such as dramatically reduce power consumption, but also produce fundamentally new functionalities such as nonvolatility and reconfigurable logics. An essential ingredient of spin-based semiconductor electronics is the efficient inter-conversions between electronic charge current and spin polarization. This project aims to explore new means of generation, control, and detection of polarized spins in semiconductors by exploiting electron motion in chiral structures, i.e. materials that exhibit distinct handedness. The pure-electronic and magnet-free methods of generating well-aligned electron spins hold the potential of enabling spin-based microelectronics free of any magnetic materials. The project therefore comprises an invaluable combination of basic science research and technology development, providing an effective venue of workforce development for both academia and the semiconductor industry. Technical Abstract: Efficient inter-conversions of charge and spin states are central to fundamental research and device functions of spintronics and quantum computation. Of particular interest are electrical creation of spin polarization and its readout as charge signals without using any ferromagnetic components. This project investigates how structural chirality engenders spin selectivity and, more generally, nonreciprocal transport effects beyond linear response, in three distinct classes of chiral materials: self-assembled monolayers of chiral organic molecules, inorganic chiral crystals, and hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. An immediate goal of the research is to elucidate the physics underlying the effect of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin polarization emerges from charge motion in materials exhibiting intrinsic structural chirality. More broadly, the research examines the general roles of structural chirality in emergent electronic excitations and novel transport effects from symmetry-breaking, electron correlations, and nontrivial band topology. The research could lead to a conceptually new magnet-free and fully electrical scheme for the generation, control, detection, and utilization of polarized spins in semiconductors.

CAREER: Topological order and edge states in fractional quantum Hall systems,"Nontechnical Abstract: Future technologies based on quantum materials and devices are expected to have applications with significant practical impact on everyday life and to provide help in solving many of today’s global challenges. This project aims to address some of the important fundamental questions about the complex phases in graphene materials used to make quantum devices. The complex special properties of these materials make them potential building blocks for future quantum computers. Various physical observables which can reflect the topological properties found in these materials are explored, with a particular focus on entropy and the way charges flow. This research helps to provide the critical fundamental knowledge required for the advancement of future topological quantum computing schemes. These new quantum technologies need an educated labor force to properly utilize the breathtaking possibilities. Therefore, the educational plan in this project focuses on creating a new generation of quantum material scientists by promoting outreach and educational opportunities for students and underrepresented groups and enhancing community’s knowledge of quantum nanoscience and nanoelectronics by a mixture of training, designing new courses and seminar series. Technical Abstract: Understanding quantum correlated phases in two dimensional systems is important for both fundamental physics and quantum-based applications. Specifically, the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is an exemplar of a topological phase of matter which provides a rich platform to study emergent phenomena and quantum statistics. While various techniques have been applied to tackle the issues of statistics and topology in FQH states over the last decade, the critical fundamental knowledge required for applications is still lacking. The topological properties of FQH states can be reflected in the entropy carried by their emergent quasiparticles, the internal structures of their edge channels, and the conductance across their specific interfaces. This project is focused on utilizing less explored approaches to measure these physical observables which can give valuable insights into the underlying topology and statistics of the FQH states. This research relies on the fabrication of clean graphene heterostructures and engineering of gate-tunable interfaces, where topologically distinct FQH phases can be interfaced within a single device. The FQH physics in these systems is investigated by a combination of thermopower, electrical transport and local probe measurements. These studies address some of the most important fundamental questions in this field. For example, what is the thermodynamic entropy carried by emergent quasiparticles of FQH states and how it can be used to distinguish Abelian and non-Abelian states? Can interfacing various FQH states be used to identify the topological order of these states or help to resolve the black hole information paradox? Addressing these questions can have important implications for the development of topological quantum computing schemes and may provide valuable insights into one of the long-standing problems in cosmology.

NUV Observations of Transients with the NUTRANS System: Providing NUV Data to the Time-Domain Community,"A 3-year research program led by investigators at the University of Arizona will extend the reach of ground-based astronomy into the near-ultraviolet (NUV) by utilizing an ultraviolet-optimized camera located at a top astronomy site to observe supernovae, the cataclysmic deaths of massive stars. Long the exclusive domain of costly and competitive space missions, the UV has had limited contributions to the study of the explosive deaths of stars. The UV emission from supernovae is a sensitive probe of the density and types of metals in the debris of stellar explosions. The team will support existing space UV telescopes, most notably the NASA Swift mission, but will also extend the science by being devoted to following transients and providing critical NUV follow-up. In the interest of maximizing scientific output and guaranteeing maximum inclusiveness, the team will freely accept targets from the entire astronomy community, as well as provide analyzed data products to all astronomers. By providing undergraduate students with hands-on experience in commissioning a UV camera on a robotic telescope, the program will be training the next generation of instrumental astronomers. Transient astronomy has grown considerably with the development of wide field-of-view detectors and the advent of true multi-messenger triggers of new events. The NUV wavelength range provides important information for transient science, as it reaches closer to the peak emission from these energetic explosions and disruptions. Additionally, the NUV is a wavelength range highly affected by absorption from iron-peak elements, so key information about the event is encoded in the evolution of the UV brightness. There is a need for new systems to observe transients in the NUV during the post-Swift era. Space-based missions are expensive and competitive. The team is adapting an existing telescope to be the first of a ground-based network of telescopes (NUTRANS) that could accomplish a large fraction of NUV science for orders of magnitude less cost. The key components of these telescopes will be a NUV CCD camera that reaches 200nm without a drop-off in transmission combined with filters sensitive to 300nm. This program will regularly add NUV information to multi-wavelength studies of transients. The system will accept sources from the worldwide transient surveys and provide real-time photometry of targets.

Material design at the picometre scale by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy,"We propose to investigate the electronic properties of artificial materials synthesised with atomic precision by means of hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). Transition metal oxides exhibit some of the most interesting phenomena in condensed matter physics, from high temperature superconductivity to metal-insulator transitions. Synthesising these materials with advanced techniques such as hMBE allows for fine control over their interactions and electronic phases. The key insight is that manipulating the atomic structure with picometer precision can have a dramatic impact on the electronic properties of quantum materials and even generate new states of matter. In recent years this vision has materialised, opening a vast research field, where exciting and unexpected discoveries are regularly reported.The research of our group is focused on the new physics of oxide heterointerfaces, where we investigate two-dimensional, gate-controlled superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling effects and magnetism. In our lab we also investigate how light can be used to create crystal structures out of equilibrium and generate new electronic and magnetic properties. Until now our research has been based on the fabrication of materials by pulsed laser deposition.  While this technique has key strengths, such as high flexibility and relative ease of use, it also has intrinsic weaknesses that are now limiting the scope of our research. In particular, in order to uncover the most fascinating quantum effects in high-mobility interacting electron systems, materials of the highest purity and with atomically sharp interfaces within a single unit cell are needed. These requirements go beyond what is achievable by the pulsed laser deposition approaches that we have used so far and can only be met by a molecular beam epitaxy system.After my recent nomination at the University of Geneva (January 2022), our group is in the start up phase of a new research programme on controlling quantum materials at the atomic scale. In our new laboratory we will focus on the synthesis of oxide heterostructures, a key area of the Swiss solid state research. We ask for financial support to acquire a hybrid molecular beam epitaxy system that will meet these challenges. By integrating this system with advanced spectroscopies (Prof. Baumberger and Prof. Renner, UniGe) and our existing optical systems for the manipulation of crystal lattices, we will create a unique facility in the world for the design of new materials.This instrument will also have an impact on the Swiss community working on materials with novel electronic properties, creating new opportunities for collaboration across different institutions, including the groups of Prof. Zardo (UniBasel) and Prof. Johnson (ETHZ). In order to ensure that this new lab provides our scientific community with the best possible quantum materials that enable scientific investigations at an international level, it is essential that we are equipped with a state-of-the-art material synthesis system. The new materials provided by our facility will be engineered through a precise control of atomic positions at the picometer scale, pursuing the ultimate challenge in material science.",562446,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
ALMA-FACTS: ALMA FundAmental CO 1-0 Transition Survey of Nearby Galaxies,"Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) are huge concentrations of gas that are formed via the attractive force of gravity. Throughout cosmic time, the gas in GMCs has been converted into stars. This process is still under way, and we can see ongoing star formation within GMCs in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. This research program investigates the evolution of molecular gas and GMCs in twelve nearby galaxies using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). It will study how the GMCs form and evolve and how they start forming stars in the galaxies. This program also integrates research and education by involving graduate and undergraduate students in the research activities, with a focus on recruiting students who discover a passion for science later in their academic careers. This program is built on the ALMA-FACTS survey (FundAmental CO 1-0 Transition Survey) of 12 nearby spiral galaxies. FACTS studies the evolution of molecular gas –by means of the systematic variations in the CO J=2-1/1-0 line ratio (R21) –on GMC scales within and among the galaxies. The galaxies are selected from the legacy surveys with a variety of telescopes (ALMA, HST, JWST, Spitzer, and Herschel), which provide rich ancillary data. FACTS utilizes the existing high-resolution CO(2-1) data of the same set of galaxies from ALMA, observing the same regions at the same physical resolution and mass sensitivity. Historically, CO(1-0) has been the yardstick of molecular gas observations, while CO(2-1) is now becoming a new standard due to its easier detectability. FACTS will characterize any systematic effects in R21 and bridge the gap between the historic CO(1-0) observations and the new standard. The main scientific goals are (1) to study systematic variations of R21 (i.e., the evolution of molecular gas) on GMC scales, in arms and interarm regions, bars, and from the centers to outskirts within/among galaxies, (2) to study the environmental conditions for SF at various stages, including GMCs on the verge of SF (i.e., having high R21, but no SF), and (3) to assess the capabilities and limitations of CO(2-1) with respect to CO(1-0), as CO(2-1) is becoming the new standard for tracing bulk molecular gas in galaxies.

Collaborative Research: Moist Convection as a Key to Exoplanet Atmospheres and Evolution,"Convection is one of the most fundamental processes in planetary atmospheres. While often imperceptible on Earth, this boiling motion — where warm air rises and cool air subsides — helps to control a wide range of atmospheric properties, from temperature to cloudiness. Despite its central importance, convection and its impacts on how worlds cool over time are thoroughly understudied for gas giant planets. To make novel scientific progress in our understanding of how convective mixing impacts the nature of giant planet atmospheres, the project will develop computational simulation tools aimed at investigating the physical, evolutionary, and observational consequences of convection for gas giant worlds. These simulations will both reveal elements of how our own Solar System has evolved over billions of years and empower observations of distant exoplanets from ground- and space-based platforms. Alongside these novel studies, efforts will also be dedicated to enhancing STEM research experiences for undergraduate researchers from historically marginalized groups. Evidence indicates that convective mixing significantly influences the atmospheric structure of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. This is especially true for clement giants experiencing water condensation, due to the large latent heat of condensation and molecular abundance for water. This project will bridge the divide between one-dimensional radiative-convective models and three-dimensional general circulation models through a novel application of convection-resolving fluid dynamics. Outcomes from these simulations will include spectral observables related to convective processes as well as novel models for how gas giant worlds cool over time. The project also includes the design, implementation, sharing, and study of a rapid Python training camp for undergraduate space science researchers from historically marginalized groups. The central goal of this training is to accelerate and improve results from undergraduate faculty-led research experiences.

Solving the solar problem with accurate opacities,"Fundamentals of stellar astrophysics rest on our understanding of the Sun. New solar abundances that are up to 40% lower for common volatile elements C, N and O, lead to serious disagreement with stellar models and helioseismological parameters such as the radiative- convection zone boundary, sound speed, and helium abundance. This is commonly referred to as the “solar problem”. The resolution of these discrepancies depends on computing accurate opacities for key atomic elements that dominate the physics of the solar interior. This project will compute accurate opacities that can be applied to the solution of the solar problem, as well emerging areas such as asteroseismology and exoplanets. The project will provide a research opportunity for a graduate student, who will be trained in computational atomic-plasma physics and in the next generation of opacity codes that will be developed during this project. This project will extend known plasma broadening schemes: thermal Doppler effect, Stark broadening due to manifold overlap and ionization due to ion microfields, and collisional electron impact broadening that is the dominant mechanism at high densities. These effects lead to broadening and dissolution of resonances, continuum lowering below atomic levels, and raising the continuum opacity. The proposed R-matrix method accounts for resonance broadening in an a priori and ab initio manner. The project entails considerable extension of previous methods and codes in a new computational package for R-matrix opacities, and calculations will encompass other Fe-group elements such as Cr and Ni ions. Monochromatic opacities will be computed at an order-of-magnitude higher resolution than hitherto, at 100,000 photon frequencies, and yield opacity tables for stellar interior models. The extensive atomic data will be available freely via the dedicated electronic database NORAD at the Ohio State University.

"Towards Understanding the Multi-Phase, Multi-Scale CGM","This research team studies the atmospheres of galaxies, which has many parallels to studying Earth's atmosphere. Earth's atmosphere is fundamental to life. The water cycle, when water changes phase, is very important for life. To study this, climate scientists run computer simulations at many different scales to get accurate results. Similarly, galactic atmospheres are fundamental to star formation in galaxies. The baryonic cycle, when gas changes phase, is very important for making stars. Galaxy models cover an enormous range of scales. The investigator will run high-resolution supercomputer simulations of galactic atmospheres on small scales to understand physics that is unresolved in larger scale simulations. He will also focus on outreach to high school students, who are at a particularly formative stage. To inspire their interest in science, especially in under-represented communities, his team will give public talks, teach weekend classes, and supervise research. The investigator will run high-resolution idealized simulations to better understand: i) turbulent fragmentation and coagulation of clouds, as well as other physical processes underlying power-law cloud mass distributions. ii) The influence of magnetic fields on key processes such as ‘shattering’, survival and growth of cold streams and clouds, cloud sizes/densities and absorption line statistics, turbulent fragmentation and coagulation. iii) The observed motion of multi-phase gas in the solar corona, resolution requirements for numerically converged absorption line column densities, and the physics behind the ubiquity of OVI in galactic halos. The deeper physical understanding of multi-phase processes can then be fed back into sub-grid prescriptions for larger scale simulations.

Multipartite Entanglement and Dynamics in Many-body Quantum Systems,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This project focuses on understanding and controlling the complex behaviors of quantum systems—those made up of many interacting particles—that arise from their interactions, randomness, and the influence of their surroundings. Recent advances in quantum technologies, such as solid-state systems, cold atoms, and quantum computers, have uncovered remarkable properties in these systems that are still not fully understood. The research aims to explore how particles in these systems are correlated quantum mechanically and how their organization is affected by factors like disorder, external disturbances, and measurement processes. It will develop new methods to study these properties and investigate how they change under different conditions, including when systems are exposed to noise or other disruptions. The outcomes could deepen our understanding of how quantum systems behave and support the development of next-generation quantum technologies. This project will also involve students and early-career researchers, encouraging collaboration and building expertise to drive progress in this cutting-edge field. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research and associated education aimed to investigate and understand novel quantum phenomena in many-body systems, particularly those that can emerge through interactions, disorder, dissipation, and periodic driving, such as Floquet driving and adiabatic processes. The focus is on exploring universal properties and phenomena in quantum phases, specifically multipartite entanglement and topological properties in open quantum systems. Key research topics include the role of multipartite entanglement and the higher Berry phase in gapped quantum phases, as well as random matrix theory applications in open quantum systems, such as Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models under Lindbladian dissipation. Additionally, the project will address related phenomena, including quantum quench and Floquet dynamics near criticality in one-dimensional systems and the study of topologically localized insulators. Using approaches from quantum field theory and quantum information, this research seeks to develop non-perturbative theoretical tools for these complex systems. The project will integrate junior researchers, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange, with the ultimate goal of achieving fundamental breakthroughs in the field.

Probing Novel Out-of-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics in Homogeneous Atomic Quantum Gases,"Dynamical systems with intrinsic instability can amplify small initial perturbations to produce fascinating features we experience daily, from cloud and pattern formation in weather and geography, freak waves in oceanography, to structure formation in the universe. Such dynamics in quantum many-body systems present interesting but challenging problems because of the need to consider quantum correlations between the constituent particles. An instability could amplify initial quantum fluctuations, noise that exists even without external or thermal perturbations, into an observable pattern that could show distinct behaviors compared with those found in classical systems. Understanding quantum instability dynamics could lead to a better understanding of microscopic to mesoscopic quantum phenomena and new applications such as quantum-enhanced amplifiers and sensors. In this project, the research team will use ultracold atomic gases to form a uniform superfluid and study its out-of-equilibrium behavior and instability-induced quantum dynamics. The first project goal aims at exploring the dynamics of ultracold atoms brought to an attractive interaction so that the system becomes unstable against density perturbations. The team will study how these perturbations evolve due to a pattern forming instability and detect quantum correlations within the system. In the second project goal, the team will implement a new scheme to make a superfluid flow faster than the speed of sound and study the instability of the supersonic flow. The aim is to examine how energy flow is dissipated in the system, which may find connections with important topics in condensed matter and plasma physics, and astronomy. This project will provide training for multiple PhD students and undergraduate research assistants, preparing them for future physics careers. The project will also support the PI’s continuing participation in outreach activities at Purdue University, including an instrumentation development program with the active involvement of service-learning undergraduate students and local high school students. The PI and the team will use ultracold cesium atoms trapped in an optical box to study novel nonequilibrium physics and instability-induced quantum dynamics. Ultracold atoms present an ideal testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics because of the well-developed control toolbox for accessing instability physics with precise timing and for probing them with many details. The tools include precision tuning of atomic interactions through a Feshbach resonance and arbitrary potential-shaping that could induce dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. High-resolution in-situ imaging, time-of-flight measurements, and interferometry will provide complementary information on the density distribution, momentum state population, and long-range phase coherence. The project goals include probing quantum many-body dynamics in an attractive Bose gas and supersonic turbulence in a superfluid. The first goal aims at studying the dynamics of quantum many-body breathers, distinct from mean-field breathers, exploring a novel quantum phase transition in a one-dimensional Bose gas that occurs even at zero temperature, and detecting the non-local correlations and quantum entanglement in a novel state of a Bose condensate following an interaction quench. The second goal aims at using engineered dissipation to induce supersonic flows in a superfluid and to observe the instability of the flow. This technique allows the study of supersonic turbulence in a compressible, zero-viscosity quantum fluid. The engineered supersonic flow also promises a new way of generating sonic black holes. Success in this project could lead to a better understanding of instabilities and entanglement generation in quantum many-body systems, quantum thermalization problems, dynamical quantum phase transitions, and quantum turbulence in supersonic flows.

Collaborative Research: NSF-NSERC: Data-enabled Model Order Reduction for 2D Quantum Materials,"The project will provide state-of-the-art computational tools for the development of novel 2D materials and their potential application to ultra-fast electronic, opto-electronic, and magnetic devices; unconventional optical and photonic devices; communication devices; and quantum computing applications. The project will address interconnected challenges in emerging areas of quantum science, computational mathematics and computer science by effectively merging highly domain-specific techniques with general machine learning techniques, thus informing and motivating analogous research on model order reduction across the sciences and engineering. 2D materials research is an ideal platform to motivate new mathematics training and curricula in the analysis, modeling, and computation of electronic structure, mechanical and topological properties of materials, and analysis of experimental data. The project’s outreach to female and underrepresented student populations will broaden the diversity of the mathematical research community, and the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. Many quantum phenomena of scientific and technological interest emerge naturally at the moiré length scales of layered 2D materials which makes those materials an exciting platform to explore quantum materials properties and to prototype quantum devices. For example, correlated electronic phases such as superconductivity have been recently observed in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Such pioneering results have opened up a new era in the investigation and exploitation of quantum phenomena. Despite the continuing increase in computational resources, high-fidelity modeling and simulation of many quantum materials systems remains out of reach. The limitation is particularly serious in 2D heterostructures due to the large scales at which the quantum phenomena of interest emerge. The objective of this NSF-NSERC Alliance project is to develop an advanced computational modeling workflow, merging state-of-the-art quantum modeling and machine-learning methods to enable rapid, automated, high-fidelity exploration of mechanical and electronic properties of 2D quantum materials. This award is jointly supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.

New Strategy for Synthesis of Atomically Precise Graphene Nanoribbons,"With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Guangbin Dong at the University of Chicago is developing efficient and scalable synthetic approaches for preparing atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). These nanoribbons are exquisitely thin strips of graphene: a sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a rigid structure that resembles chicken wire. Graphene nanoribbons have emerged as attractive organic materials for potential applications in high speed, lightweight, flexible electronic, and spintronic devices. In this project, physical organic chemistry knowledge will be combined with advanced tools of transition metal catalysis to develop efficient strategies for making these interesting materials. If successful, the research will address a long-standing challenge of preparing narrow zig-zag graphene nanoribbons for studying their physical, electronical, optical, and magnetic properties. The research team will also be actively engaged in the Chicago Pre-College Science & Engineering Program (ChiS&E) to provide early chemistry education to Chicago public middle-school students, the Collegiate Scholars Program to teach high school students, and the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) to offer lab research experience to undergraduate students. Integration of the project with these outreach activities has the potential to greatly encourage diverse and students from underrepresented groups to explore careers in science and engineering while learning and actively contributing to research. The research project will focus on the development of efficient and scalable synthetic approaches towards atomically precise and narrow N=3-5 zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs). The preparation and fabrication in liquid phase of well-defined pristine zGNRs are very challenging and underdeveloped. To overcome these unmet challenges, stepwise cyclodehydrogenation approaches to access zGNRs from their more stable oxidized or reduced precursor ribbons will be devised. The novel monomer synthesis, on the other hand, will be explored using palladium/norbornene catalysis. Compared to the existing approaches for GNR synthesis, the merits of the new strategies have the potential to be quite significant: (i) monomers will be prepared in a streamlined manner from commercially available starting materials; (ii) the syntheses will be scalable by using in solution polymerization; (iii) air sensitive intermediates will be circumvented, easing the material transfer process; (iv) aryl−aryl cleavage defects are to be minimized by avoiding labile m-xylene-type units. The knowledge gained from this project has the potential to advance the understanding of these graphene-like quasi-one-dimensional polymers, which in turn will further stimulate the development of other new conjugated organic semiconducting materials.

Advances in Coupled Cluster Theory,"John F. Stanton of the University of Florida is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop and implement quantum-mechanical methods for doing calculations relevant to the fields of molecular spectroscopy and chemical kinetics. The Stanton group has a longstanding presence in an area that can be characterized as “Theoretical Chemical Physics”. In the research supported by this grant, they will continue to develop and refine methods relevant to the areas of molecular spectroscopy (how molecules and electromagnetic radiation interact) and chemical kinetics (how quickly chemical reactions occur). In addition to this, the development of the base quantum-chemical methods will be extended. In particular, the supported research will produce cutting-edge software program packages for doing very accurate calculations for “open-shell’’ molecules (those that contain one or more unpaired electrons). It is expected that the software will be the most efficient available to the community for studying this interesting class of molecules that are relevant to areas such as the environment, energy science, and astronomy. This work will extend a highly efficient coupled-cluster (CC) package (NCC, developed previously by the PI and D.A. Matthews of Texas Methodist University) to open-shell reference functions, for which methods for ground and excited states (CC and EOM-CC) will be implemented for general open-shell references up through the CCSDTQ level of theory. In addition, analytic gradients for all of these methods will become available within the funding period. Beyond this, a method that accounts for quantum tunneling effects in chemical kinetics – semiclassical transition theory – will be studied to assess how far below the barrier this method is able to provide accurate results. Remaining research on electronic spectroscopy will range from a diagrammatic fundamental analysis of the spectroscopic intensity of complicated vibronic interactions and study of the uniquely complex A-state of the nitrate radical.

High-field quantum matter X-ray scattering (HIQXS),"Intense magnetic fields of up to and exceeding 100 Tesla are nowadays available at specialized high-field laboratories which allow obtaining fascinating insight in to the so-called quantum limit of solids at high magnetic fields and low temperatures. For example, quantum oscillations experiments give access to the electronic structure of quantum many-body ground states, such as high-temperature superconductors, strongly-correlated heavy-Fermion materials or quantum Hall systems. Understanding the underlying interactions of these systems is not only of fundamental but also technological interest. However, while these high-field probes are powerful to shed light on the high-field electronic properties, they are much less suited to gain direct insight of field-induced symmetry breaking. Structural probes have also made tremendous progress in the last decades. In particular, the advent of X-ray free-electron lasers (FEL) now permits to map structural dynamics at the inherent time (femtosecond) and length (Ångström) scales. Furthermore, the brilliant X-ray FEL pulses can also be used single-shot experiments where diffraction patterns with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio are recorded by individual X-ray snapshots. For example, earlier we have demonstrated the power of synchronizing femtosecond X-ray FEL pulses with millisecond pulsed magnetic fields, which has led to the discovery of a long-range charge-ordered state that underlies high-temperature superconductivity in copper-oxide materials.Here we propose to close the gap between high-field laboratory and beamline work via an integrated approach: We have formed a Swiss-French consortium of condensed matter physicists with complementary expertise in high magnetic field technology and cryogenics, as well as scattering techniques. Together, we want to benefit from the opportunities at the Cristallina-Quantum endstation of SwissFEL where high pulsed magnetic fields, low-temperature sample environments and X-ray scattering can be brought together in a unique fashion. To this end, we plan to collaboratively tackle one technical (realization of sub-1.5 Kelvin sample temperatures) and five scientific work packages. The focus of the latter ranges from searching for direct experimental evidence for mechanism that underlie field-induced multiferroicity, quantum magnetism and hidden orders, as well as the search for the theoretically predicted three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. All of these examples build on some form of spin-charge-lattice interaction which permits an “informed” search for the scattering signals.In addition to bringing together a diverse team of experts to tackle open scientific questions at the forefront of contemporary condensed matter physics, our binational consortium represents a push towards building up a lively user community at SwissFEL, where also high-field condensed matter research is represented.",551470,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; France; Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Topological quantum matter and crystalline symmetry,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research on understanding new kinds of phenomena that can arise due to the presence of crystalline symmetry in quantum systems. Quantum materials typically exist in a crystalline environment due to the periodic arrangement of atoms. Hence, the material under question often also has a crystallographic symmetry that includes rotations, reflections, and translations of the space, meaning that the crystal structure remains the same under such operations. In the presence of these symmetries, quantum materials can host new types of physical phenomena. For example, if a quantum material has a rotational symmetry, then it is possible for certain kinds of crystal defects to accumulate quantized electric charges that are fractions of the charge of the electron. The project will incorporate methods from mathematical physics and quantum field theory to further our ability to characterize and classify the robust, quantized properties exhibited by quantum systems with crystalline symmetry. The project will also develop methods to experimentally probe these phenomena in a variety of settings, including two-dimensional quantum materials, photonic systems, and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. The project has a strong educational component, as it fully supports a graduate student. The PI will further develop and publicly release lecture notes for his special topics graduate courses on topological quantum matter and on machine learning. In addition, the PI will remain active in various forms of outreach, at the high school level through outreach programs at his institution and through an active social media presence. Ongoing industry collaborations will further broaden the societal impacts of the project through its applications to quantum computing. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research in developing the theory of topological phases of matter with crystalline symmetry. This theory will apply in the regime of strong interactions, and thus go beyond single-particle band theory, using the tools of topological quantum field theory. The project has several different components and builds directly on significant progress from the last project period. In the first component, the PI’s group will extend their theories of two-dimensional strongly interacting crystalline topological phases, which applied to the case orientation-preserving wallpaper groups, to include all 17 wallpaper groups. The second component is to perform numerical calculations for models of fractional Chern insulators and quantum spin liquids, specifically using projected quantum wave functions, to understand the emergence of new crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants and their physical properties. These include invariants obtained through partial symmetry operations and through fractional charges accumulated at lattice defects. The third component is to develop methods to experimentally probe the PI’s recently discovered crystalline topological invariants in two-dimensional quantum materials, photonic systems, and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. Finally, the theoretical advances will be extended to develop a theory of critical phenomena enhanced with crystalline symmetry. The project has a strong educational component, as it fully supports a graduate student. The PI will further develop and publicly release lecture notes for his special topics graduate courses on topological quantum matter and on machine learning. In addition, the PI will remain active in various forms of outreach, at the high school level through outreach programs at his institution and through an active social media presence.

Colloidal Chemistry of III-V Semiconductor Quantum Dots in Molten Inorganic Salt,"With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Dmitri Talapin of the University of Chicago will be developing methods to make some of today’s best performing semiconductor materials affordable to all. The best solar cells, LEDs and lasers use materials like gallium arsenide (GaAs). This material and its cousins, called the “III-Vs,” are made of inexpensive elements, but they are very difficult and expensive to produce by current technologies. However, if III-Vs could be turned into quantum dots (particles around one ten-millionth of an inch across that were at the core of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), then they could be produced on a large scale. Early attempts at this failed because ordinary solvents are not compatible with the high temperatures required. The Talapin research group will be using molten salts, including sodium chloride (table salt) as solvents to grow III-V quantum dots either from scratch or by converting more readily accessible quantum dots into GaAs and other more challenging III-V-type nanostructures. This program will train scientists in state-of-the-art techniques in both chemistry and physics and also support outreach to Chicago’s South Side to enrich public understanding of the materials that illuminate our surroundings. Semiconductors of the III-V variety are more engineerable than other compound semiconductors and have generally superior optical and electronic characteristics. The research program seeks to expand the fundamental boundaries for solution synthesis of nanoscale III-V semiconductors by investigating key aspects of the chemistry and physics of colloidal synthesis in molten inorganic salts, from examining the stability of nanoscale III V phases in molten salts with different Lewis acidity and redox potentials, to developing new syntheses of binary, ternary and quaternary III-V nanocrystals. State-of-the-art spectroscopic, electrochemical, and X-ray scattering techniques will be implemented for mechanistic studies of III-V nanocrystal synthesis in high-temperature molten salts. These studies have the potential to advance the development of new functional materials, to help uncover their electronic and optical properties, and to potentially open up important new avenues for the synthesis of III-V semiconductors by solution methods. The ultimate goal is to control the morphology, defects, doping, surface and other characteristics of colloidal III-V nanostructures on a level comparable to III-V nanostructures grown by high-temperature physical epitaxial deposition methods.

CAREER: Elliptic cohomology and quantum field theory,"The research of this award lies at the interface between theoretical physics and geometry. An unsolved conjecture posits a deep connection between the geometry of supersymmetric quantum field theories and certain structures in algebraic topology. Resolving this conjecture would provide new insight into the mathematical foundations of quantum field theory, while also providing several long-anticipated applications of algebraic topology in physics. The projects the PI will work on leverage higher categorical symmetries to gain new insights into this 30-year-old conjecture. The award supports graduate students working with the PI whose research will contribute to this area. The PI will also continue his involvement in mathematics education for incarcerated people through the Education Justice Project in Illinois. The proposed research is centered on an equivariant refinement of Stolz and Teichner’s conjectured geometric model for elliptic cohomology from 2-dimensional supersymmetric field theories. The overarching goal is to link structures in Lurie’s 2-equivariant elliptic cohomology with the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories. Some of the projects are natural extensions of prior work at heights zero and one, focusing on height 2 generalizations of specific quantum field theories that are expected to construct elliptic Thom classes. Other projects will initiate the study of 2-equivariant geometry, interfacing with topics in string geometry, loop group representation theory, and elliptic power operations.

CAREER: Effective Hamiltonian Downfolding Methods for Studying Linear and Nonlinear Responses of Quantum Materials,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education focused on bridging the gap between experimental probes and theoretical understanding of quantum materials, for which fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics play essential roles in their function and properties. Examples include superconductors, quantum magnets, and topological insulators which are insulating materials through their bulk but can conduct electricity on their surfaces. These materials offer unique electronic, optical, and magnetic properties important for technological applications. However, simulating these materials and predicting their properties can be challenging and computationally demanding due to the quantum mechanical entanglement between their electronic degrees of freedom. In order to address these complications, the research team will develop and distribute state-of-the-art computer codes for constructing material-specific effective models. A particular focus will be models for non-linear responses: processes in which the materials interact with light of a particular frequency, and, for example, emit light at a different frequency. The particular frequency and polarization dependence of these processes can provide precise clues about the underlying quantum mechanical degrees of freedom and their entanglement. The research team will work in collaboration with experimental groups to provide material-specific theoretical analysis to support and interpret such non-linear responses in quantum materials. The research team will include students at various levels, including high school summer interns. Concurrently, the PI has partnered with the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County school board to develop a university level course training students in scientific outreach and public communication. The latter is an increasingly vital aspect of a research career, in which students rarely receive formal training. This course aims to bridge this gap and provide a framework and course materials that can be adapted by other institutions. These PI's education and outreach activities will serve to engage with local community, contribute to training the next generation of researchers and educators, and help build a foundation for would-be first-generation university attendees to pursue scientific careers. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education towards numerical methods for treating complex quantum materials. The research team will leverage recent developments in Matrix Product State approaches for fermionic systems to implement first-principles based calculation of low-energy effective Hamiltonians capable of treating large orbital spaces. These many-body approaches naturally capture the full ""entanglement structure"" of local degrees of freedom, and thus provide accurate tools for estimating generic coupling constants, even for the most complicated spin-orbital materials. The methods will allow for the calculation of material-specific dynamical effective Hamiltonians, to address nonlinear responses such as second harmonic generation and four-wave mixing. Theoretical support for analyzing such experiments on correlated materials currently lags significantly behind experimental capabilities. The methods will be applied to the search for topological excitons and novel quantum spin-orbital liquids, and the understanding of nonlinear responses of hidden ordered phases. These activities will have direct impact on research and education through student training, K-12 outreach, and public distribution of numerical codes. Though partnerships with local Title 1 high-schools, Scientist in the Classroom events, and the development of a new university-level Scientific Outreach course, the participation of Wake Forest students in local outreach will be significantly expanded. In addition, summer interns from low-income backgrounds will be recruited to participate, with graduate student mentors, in research and career-development activities.

"CAREER: Gauge-theoretic Floer invariants, C* algebras, and applications of analysis to topology","The main research goal of this project is to apply analytic tools coming from physics, such as gauge theory and operator algebras, to topology, which is the study of geometric shapes. This research is divided into two themes: low dimensional topology and operator K-theory. In both fields, the aforementioned analytic tools are used to build invariants to study the geometric structure of manifolds, which are spaces modelled on Euclidean spaces, like the 3-dimensional space we live in. In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. In low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.

Forming planetesimals from gravitational collapse,"Before planets form, smaller bodies called planetesimals must form. The leading hypothesis for their formation is the gravitational collapse of clouds of approximately pebble-sized objects. Some planetesimals are relicts in the modern Solar System and can serve to test this hypothesis. This project at Michigan State University (MSU) uses novel computer simulations of gravitational collapse to predict planetesimal properties at the end of the process. The collapse process involves of order 10^21 pebbles, and current simulations make such drastic simplifications that they cannot predict with accuracy many planetesimal properties such as shape and spin. The new MSU model will transition between different pebble interactions in different regimes of validity, which allow the final properties to be realistic. The broader impact of this work will be felt through training of students (particularly underrepresented minorities) in STEM. The team will also engage with the MSU community and the public via the MSU Science Festival, MSU Observatory open houses, and public events at Abrams Planetarium. The overall objective of the proposed work is to accurately simulate the gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud using a hybrid N-body model and reproduce observed properties of relict planetesimals in the solar system. The new hybrid N-body model combines the best aspects of existing perfect merger and soft-sphere discrete element methods in order to simulate the gravitational collapse process. The project maps independent variables such as cloud rotation state, internal mass distribution, and model contact physics to dependent variables such as final planetesimal mass, shape, spin, and bound multiple system (i.e., binary) properties. The physical parameters in the protoplanetary disk thus might be inferred from the distribution of those properties. The group will train a graduate student and six undergraduate students (recruited directly from the MSU Drew Scholars program) with important STEM skills such as high-performance computing.

"Exploring emergent phenomena at the interface of topological semimetals, magnetism, and superconductivity","Non-technical abstract: A central theme in contemporary condensed matter physics is the design of ‘topological quantum materials’ whose unusual physical properties are best described by an elegant interplay between core concepts from modern physics (quantum mechanics, special relativity) and mathematics (symmetry, topology). In this project, the principal investigator (PI) focuses on designing, synthesizing, and studying a new family of topological quantum materials (‘hybrid topological semimetal heterostructures’) whose topological character is not immutably determined by the crystal composition and structure, but rather can be tuned using an external knob (electrical voltage). This provides a powerful framework for developing a rigorous understanding of emergent quantum phenomena that are predicted to arise in these quantum materials. The hybrid topological semimetals developed in this project also lend themselves to the fashioning of device components that are relevant for future quantum technologies. The PI uses state-of-the-art materials synthesis (‘molecular beam epitaxy’), accompanied by advanced nanopatterning and measurement methodologies, to carry out this research. The project trains students in sophisticated experimental techniques so that they can effectively contribute at the frontiers of quantum science and technology in academia and industry. The PI is committed to developing a research program that combines scientific excellence with an inclusive, supportive, nurturing climate. The PI and graduate students are also developing outreach activities aimed at engaging and educating general audiences about contemporary quantum materials through hands on activities such as a ‘quantum materials escape room’ during Penn State’s Family weekends and during visits to local elementary schools. Technical abstract: Dirac and Weyl semimetals form an important part of the contemporary landscape of topological quantum materials because the presence of Weyl nodes leads to remarkable physical consequences, such as surface Fermi arcs, the chiral anomaly, the anomalous Hall effect, and the axial magnetoelectric effect. Most experimental studies of these topological semimetals focus on materials whose topological band structure is fixed by the crystal lattice structure and composition. This project centers on developing and studying epitaxially engineered hybrid topological semimetal heterostructures wherein the underlying symmetries (time reversal, inversion, gauge) and topology can be electrically tuned in a single material via interfacial proximity effects. Molecular beam epitaxy is used to synthesize heterostructures that interface the canonical Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 with a ferromagnetic III-V semiconductor (such as [In,Mn]As) and with a conventional superconductor (such as Nb), thus creating a hybrid quantum material system wherein electrostatic gating tunes the breaking of time reversal symmetry and gauge symmetry. A comprehensive suite of spin-sensitive probes (anomalous Hall effect, quantum transport, spin-dependent tunneling, polarized neutron reflectometry) and phase coherent measurements (Josephson effect, mesoscopic transport) are marshaled in a search for signatures of topological phase transitions as well as emergent topological states such as skyrmions and monopole superconductivity.

CAREER: Orbital-based Descriptors for Dynamical Properties of Quantum Defects,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to understand how quantum devices can be physically realized by defects in solids, as well as how to rank and optimize their performance in search of an ideal candidate. A quantum bit (qubit) – the fundamental unit in achieving quantum computation – requires a physical representation based on a quantum mechanical system with a binary degree of freedom to host its zeros and ones. Crystallographic point defects constitute one promising physical qubit platform. To qualify as an ideal defect-based qubit, a long list of performance requirements related to the defect’s physical properties need to be met. This project will focus on two such properties related to (i) how atomic vibrations affect light absorption, and (ii) how quickly defect spins can change states following light absorption. To model these properties, two sets of computer simulation methods will be developed. One set will perform accurate but computationally demanding calculations based on microscopic models, serving as reference for select defects. Another set of methods will rely on physically motivated approximations for higher computational efficiency; they will be calibrated and validated by the accurate methods and will streamline the evaluation of a wider variety of potential defect candidates. This project will benefit society and technological development by broadening the design space and delivering rational design rules for quantum devices. Integrated with research, the following educational activities will be developed. First, the PI will develop a workshop that guides high school students in reading research papers and formulating research questions in materials physics. The workshop will aim at guiding career aspirations in scientific, engineering, and mathematical disciplines and cultivating authentic research experiences in materials physics. Second, the project will develop a platform enabling high school students to generate virtual reality demonstrations of defect and crystal structures for outreach events at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. Third, the PI will introduce a new high performance computing module to the undergraduate computational physics curriculum at his institution. The project will also support travel to annual conferences at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, where student experience and research outcomes will be shared with prospective Hispanic students interested in physics and inspire their careers in physics. TECHNICAL SUMMARY Crystallographic point defects constitute one promising physical platform for implementing spin-based qubits, delivering both potential scalability and long spin coherence times. As the search for ideal defect qubits advances, increasingly complex defect metrics need to be predicted and optimized. Despite recent advances in first-principles defect modeling, two dynamical properties of defects – electron-phonon coupling and intersystem crossing rates – remain hard to calculate and hard to interpret. To tackle this challenge, the PI and his team will develop orbital-based descriptors for Huang-Rhys factors (for electron-phonon coupling), excited-state spin-orbit coupling matrix elements, and singlet-triplet splitting, thereby delivering rational design rules to optimize them for qubit applications. The development of each descriptor will be accompanied by first-principles validation. Excited-state methods ranging from constrained density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the GW-Bethe Salpeter Equation approach will provide references, while ground-state DFT will be the basis of descriptor design. Established descriptors will be applied to a wider variety of defects and entered into a public database allowing user query, facilitating future modeling efforts. Integrated with research, the following educational activities will be developed. First, the PI will develop a workshop that guides high school students in reading research papers and formulating research questions in materials physics. The workshop will aim at guiding career aspirations in scientific, engineering, and mathematical disciplines and cultivating authentic research experiences in materials physics.

Mixed Quantum-Classical Semiclassical Theory: Finding Reaction Paths in Open Quantum Systems,"With support from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) program in the Division of Chemistry, Nandini Ananth of Cornell University is developing a rigorous semiclassical framework for the simulation of open quantum systems. Understanding, at the levels of atoms and electrons, the way enzymes work, or the way energy and charge move through a solar energy harvesting device remain important scientific challenges. Ananth and her research group will work to develop new theories and computational methods that can describe these inherently quantum mechanical processes accurately and predictively. Successfully completion of this research has the potential for broad significant impact in areas ranging from drug design, to the development of energy-efficient materials, to designing quantum computers. The Ananth group will also continue their outreach efforts to ensure that middle-high school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry are equipped with the computational skills that are necessary for a modern career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Under this award, Nandini Ananth and her research team will build on the strengths of semiclassical theory as a rigorous and predictive theory, while systematically addressing the facets of the theory that make it computationally intractable. This will be achieved using an innovative approach to mixed quantization in the semiclassical framework that does not rely on spatial fragmentation schemes, but rather on sensitive control of that each degree of freedom contributes to the overall phase. Ananth and her research group will develop controlled approximations to this theory to enable large scale atomistic simulations and on-the-fly simulations of both adiabatic and nonadiabatic processes within a semiclassical framework. These methods will then be used to perform a detailed study of enzyme catalysis, a model for biological open quantum systems. The tools for atomistic simulations developed in the context of this enzyme study are expected to find broad applicability in areas ranging from spintronics and quantum information science to heterogeneous catalysis.

Investigations in High Energy Physics,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Ayres Freitas and Adam Leibovich at the University of Pittsburgh. This research will contribute to developing improved theoretical tools and calculational methods for the robust interpretation of results from current and future physics experiments. To test our current understanding of the Universe, it may be necessary to identify a potentially small new physics signal on top of large backgrounds. This requires a detailed understanding of the properties and interactions of known particles and advanced techniques for calculating precise predictions for experimental observations. As part of this research, a wide variety of phenomena will be investigated, from sub-atomic particles to gravity to cosmology. Research in this area advances the national interest by expanding our knowledge of fundamental physical laws and providing opportunities for junior scientists to engage in cutting-edge calculations using cutting-edge analysis tools. Indeed, the broader impacts of this research program include the training and professional development of several PhD students and a postdoc. Professors Freitas and Leibovich will also work closely with colleagues in high-energy experiments and in astrophysics research groups in order to ensure that their work can be incorporated in new search and analysis techniques. They will also help to organize workshops and summer schools to disseminate results from modern research to a larger audience of students and junior researchers. More technically, this research program can be divided into four main parts: (1) The development of calculational techniques for higher-order electroweak corrections to precision studies at the ongoing Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and at planned future e+e- colliders; (2) An investigation of several jet observables using fragmentation functions to a jet (FFJ) and Soft-Collinear Effective Theory; (3) Studies that compare the experimental constraints on effective neutrino and Higgs interactions to direct searches for new physics particles that could mediate these interactions, thus exploring the complementarity between the LHC, neutrino-beam experiments, and future e+e- colliders; and (4) Calculations of precise gravitational wave physics using effective field theory techniques, in particular the memory effect in binary systems with large mass ratios.

NSF-BSF: The Origin of the Excess of Bright Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn,"There are an unexpectedly large number of bright galaxies with extremely high luminosities, which suggests star formation rates 100 times more than our own Milky Way today. The investigators will look at high-redshift massive dark matter halos to assess whether the physical conditions in these systems could explain the existing observations. They will test the hypothesis that these galaxies host a new type of interstellar medium, in which stellar feedback cannot regulate star formation. Understanding star formation and feedback in such an extreme environment will test several competing theories regarding the physics of the interstellar medium and its effect on galaxy formation. The project will also support two-week summer internships for local high-school students. The researchers will study the evolution of massive halos at Cosmic Dawn. The simulation effort will be based on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement cosmological fluid code RAMSES applied to 10 massive halos extracted from simulated catalogs. The simulations will incorporate subgrid turbulence, a turbulent dynamo model promoting strong magnetic fields and cosmic ray feedback, fully coupled radiative transfer in different photon groups with various thermal and dynamical effects on the gas. The analytic modeling will be used to guide and interpret the simulations. It will also provide a framework for developing a new semi-analytival model suitable for these high-redshift galaxies. The project will produce JWST mock observations from the models. JWST observations will continue to arrive at a steadily increasing pace and this project will leverage the best available data on the high-redshift Universe.

Quantum Simulation with Rydberg Synthetic Dimensions,"Objects whose behavior is dominated by quantum mechanics, such as individual atoms, ions, or photons, can be harnessed for new approaches to computation, communication, and environmental sensing that have the potential to greatly advance applications in all of these areas. These new approaches take advantage of uniquely quantum phenomena known as ‘superposition’ and ‘entanglement’ to calculate the answers to certain types of problems much faster than a classical computer or perform amazingly precise measurements. In this project, the research team will develop new techniques to use the internal motions of the electrons in atoms, atom-atom interactions, and microwave electric fields to create a physical system that is dominated by quantum mechanics and highly controllable, which can be used for a form of quantum computing known as quantum simulation. This system can be tuned to simulate real materials or phenomenological models thought to display new phenomena that can stretch our understanding of how complex properties of materials emerge from simple building blocks of atoms and molecules. This will teach us about the behavior of systems that are far too complex for classical computers to describe. The ultimate goals of this work are to develop this new platform for quantum simulation and apply it to important problems related to the emergence of complex phenomena in many-body quantum systems, such as advanced material properties. The work will also provide research experiences for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds, improving retention in STEM fields, and train graduate students to produce the quantum workforce needed for these emerging applications. The specific platform that will be used for quantum simulation is a manifold of highly excited (Rydberg) atomic states coupled with resonant microwave fields. This creates a synthetic dimension that can mimic the Hamiltonian of particles moving through sites of a real-space lattice potential. The specific goals are to complete construction of an optical tweezer assembly that can be used to create interacting, multi-particle systems in synthetic space for the study of bound states, correlated tunneling, and scattering in few-body systems. Larger systems of ten or more tweezers each containing an individual atom will be used to study thermalization processes in synthetic space and search for phase transitions to correlated string and membrane states that are predicted to occur with increasing interactions. Phenomena arising from dipole-dipole interactions in a system constructed from ns and n’p states and van der Waals interactions in a synthetic space constructed solely of ns states will be studied. Both forms of interaction are localized in synthetic space, which is an important advance. The creation of two-dimensional configurations in synthetic space will give access to phenomena such as artificial gauge fields and higher-order topological systems.

High-precision neutrino physics towards CP violation measurement: from T2K to Hyper-Kamiokande,"The search for Charge-Parity (CP) violation, one of the few unknowns left in the Standard Model of particles, is the main goal of long-baseline (LBL) neutrino oscillation experiments. LBL experiments use intense beams of $/nu_{/mu}$ or $/bar{/nu}_{/mu}$ and search for CPV by looking for differences in the $/nu_{/mu} /rightarrow /nu_e$ and $/bar{/nu}_{/mu} /rightarrow /bar{/nu}_e$ oscillation probabilities at the far detector (FD), a few hundred kilometres away from the neutrino production point. A Near Detector (ND) complex, positioned before flavor oscillations occur, measure the neutrino flux and cross section and constrain the corresponding systematic uncertainties in the search for CP violation.The Japanese LBL neutrino programme is currently defined by the T2K (Tokai-To-Kamioka) experiment. Starting from 2027, the programme will evolve into Hyper-Kamiokande (HK), a 8 times more massive FD compared to Super-Kamiokande used by T2K. T2K and HK will share the same neutrino beamline at J-PARC and the same near detector, ND280. To cope with the large statistics that will be collected at the FD in the next years, also thanks to a higher neutrino beam intensity, a vigorous programme of reduction of systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux and cross section is carried on by measuring neutrino interactions at ND280, recently upgraded by the T2K collaboration with the construction of a novel 3D segmented scintillator active target and new time projection chambers. The PIs, after conceiving, designing and, finally, upgrading the ND280 complex, with this project aim to exploit the new ND280 data by performing high-precision measurements of the $/nu_{/mu}$-nucleus cross-section, boosted by newly developed deep learning (DL) tools, and of the $/nu_e$-nucleus cross-section with low gamma conversion background samples. The ND280 measurements at T2K, combined with an active R&D work and detector simulation studies, will lead, thanks to this project, to the conceptual design of ND280++, an additional upgrade of ND280 designed for the Hyper-K high-precision phase after 2030.The project will give continuity to the French and Swiss leaderships in both experiments and confirm their centrality also in the context of the HK Near Detector. The project milestones are:(1) perform the first $/nu_{/mu}$-nucleus charged current cross section measurement with a comprehensive characterisation of nuclear effects, including the vertex activity, i.e. the signature left in the detector by indiscernible low-momentum particles stopping near the interaction vertex, using the novel DL tools;(2) perform a high-purity $/nu_e$-nucleus charged current cross section measurement, with the rejection of the dominant $/gamma /rightarrow e+e-$ background enhanced by SuperFGD, the new 3D granular scintillator active target; (3) develop the conceptual design of ND280++ for the HK high-precision phase with R&D on a novel 3D granular water-based liquid scintillator detector, to improve the modelling of $/nu_{/mu}$ cross section in water, the same active medium as the HK far detector, as well as detector simulation studies and consequent impact on the sensitivity to CP violation discovery. The $/nu_{/mu}$ and $/nu_e$ cross section measurements, to be performed at T2K, will be crucial to achieve a good understanding of the ND280 detector performance and obtain a precise extrapolation to the HK ND280++. These data analyses will be important also to develop and establish the analysis techniques that will be used at HK ND280 with higher statistics in the final search for CP violation.",536248,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Visualizing the bulk-boundary correspondence in antiferromagnetic topological matter,"Nontechnical Abstract Future quantum technologies depend heavily on novel quantum materials and their exotic electronic properties. This research project focuses on exploring the electronic characteristics of a unique class of materials known as magnetic topological insulators. Unlike conventional materials, topological materials exhibit distinct electronic states at their edges, surfaces, or even corners. These states are exceptionally robust, protected by the material's topology, making them resistant to disruptions from defects and impurities. To investigate these materials experimentally, the research team utilizes a scanning tunneling microscope, an instrument that enables visualization of atoms and electrons on a material's surface with atomic precision. With this tool, the team is examining the surfaces, edges and corners of topological materials and probing the electronic states present at these boundaries. These studies are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of novel topological phenomena, potentially driving advances in computing and materials science. The research project also includes outreach activities for K-12 students, featuring tabletop demonstrations and hands-on experiments with cryogenic cooling and superconducting levitation. Additionally, the principal investigator plans to write a scientific article for non-specialists on magnetic topological materials, highlighting insights gained from scanning tunneling microscopy. Technical Abstract Quantum materials exhibiting magnetism and higher-order topology represent a fascinating frontier in condensed matter physics. These materials feature robust and exotic electronic modes at their surfaces, hinges (edges), and even corners, protected by the topological properties and symmetries of their bulk. This research project investigates quantum materials with a strong interplay between antiferromagnetism, electronic correlations, and non-trivial topology. Specifically, the focus is on studying the axion insulator state and the emergent hinge and corner modes in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic topological matter. To achieve this, the research team employs spectroscopic imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope, an ideal tool for directly visualizing localized boundary modes at or near atomic steps, as well as their energy-momentum structure and non-trivial topology. This research also has broader impacts through outreach activities designed to captivate and inspire K-12 students. These activities include live demonstrations and hands-on experiments, such as cryogenic cooling and superconducting levitation, conducted during major soccer tournaments.

Collaborative Research: Studying Nearby Cosmic Explosions from their Earliest Moments,"Exploding stars, called supernovae, have an outsized impact on the Universe, seeding the next generations of stars and planets with newly-forged chemical elements, and shaping galaxies. Important clues about what exploded and how arrives only in the first hours and days after these explosions, so it is important to have telescopes that can promptly identify and study new supernovae. This research team will enhance its rapid survey for the nearest and brightest supernovae in the sky. They will incorporate new infrastructure to find even younger nearby. As part of this work, three graduate students will learn and contribute to supernova science and develop skills in technical software, data analysis, and scientific presentation and publication. The team will also communicate research results and technical expertise to the public, running a software bootcamp at Pima Community College, using supernova science examples, and contributing to planetarium shows at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. The team will search for supernova in galaxies within 40 Mpc of Earth, taking advantage of four small telescopes in the PROMPT network. The survey employs a real-time machine learning algorithm that can automatically trigger other telescopes once a strong supernova candidate is found; further improvements to this algorithm will be made, incorporating new telescopes and instruments. Combining this active search with the data streams of other supernova searches will yield 30 very young nearby supernovae over three years – the predict the discovery of 12 thermonuclear, type Ia supernovae; 12 core collapse supernovae and 6 stripped envelope supernovae. Early spectroscopy that displays narrow emission lines will probe the composition of the circumstellar medium and thus the final years of the progenitor star’s life. For all types of supernovae, densely time-sampled spectroscopy will measure the composition and distribution of the ejecta.

FLASC FLASH effect when beam SCanning,"Boosting the anti-tumor efficacy without causing normal tissue injury remains the holy grail of radiotherapy (RT), which may soon be reached by emerging RT techniques, such as FLASH-RT. FLASH-RT relies on ultra-high dose rates (UHDR) to deliver the prescribed dose in a fraction of a second. UHDR were proven to protect healthy tissues1-6, while maintaining the anti-tumor efficacy of the conventional (CONV) dose-rates1,3,5,6. The so-called FLASH effect was confirmed in various tissues (lung1,2, brain3,4, gut5,6, skin7,8) and animal models (mice1-6,8, pig7, cat7, zebrafish9), which led to the first administration of FLASH-RT on a human patient10. The scientific evidence was obtained mainly with small (< 3 cm) beams in a single field configuration. Existing devices are not able to deliver easily large enough fields at UHDR level to cover deep clinically relevant targets (10 x 10 cm2), which presents one of the major issues for clinical transfer of FLASH-RT. A straightforward solution is to implement beam scanning techniques inspired by pencil beam scanning (PBS) that is routinely applied in proton therapy centers. Beam scanning is also a foreseen dose delivery method for the upcoming very-high energy electron (VHEE) beams, another radiation modality that will provide access to treating deep seated tumors at UHDR. However, the scanning process imposes overlapping dose contributions from neighboring irradiation fields, resulting in complex spatial and temporal modifications to the dose delivery. The impact of these modifications on the FLASH effect has not been systematically investigated and remains unknown. Such investigations are crucial for providing guidance and limitations on the use of scanned beams for clinical implementation of the FLASH-RT. Objectives and specific aims: We have constructed a motorized slit system that is able to spatially modulate our FLASH validated electron beam by scanning a narrow slit across the static radiation field. We will use this system to simulate scanned FLASH beam delivery and investigate the impact of different scanning configurations on the normal tissue sparing and anti-tumor efficacy of FLASH-RT. We plan to realize our objectives through two specific aims using the Oriatron eRT6 linac at CHUV:Specific Aim 1: Optimization of the motorized slit system for scanned FLASH beam delivery. We will design an irradiation scheme to generate scanned beam delivery that produces lateral and depth dose distributions similar to a non-scanned beam. We will use well known beam metrics, such as beam flatness, PDD profile, and total absorbed dose to water to evaluate the radiation fields obtained by slit scanning. We will adapt the existing set-up if needed. We will establish more than ten final scanning configurations that will be applied in biological studies.    Specific Aim 2: Investigation of the impact of scanned beam delivery on FLASH effect. We will investigate the influence of the beam scanning on the FLASH effect by comparing normal tissue protection obtained with scanned vs. non-scanned FLASH beams in: a) mouse skin and b) chorioallantoic membrane model (CAM). A murine head and neck tumor will be used to evaluate the tumor kill in vivo by all beams (non-scanned and scanned). These studies will provide a comprehensive assessment of the FLASH effect (normal tissue & tumor control) under scanned beam delivery by evaluating its dependency on timing properties of different scanning configurations. Collateral benefits will be the first time use of the CAM model for FLASH research and potential implication of a new mechanism mediating the differential FLASH effect based on differences in the structural organization of the vasculature in normal tissues and tumors.Expected results and impact: We will systematically compare the biological outcomes of scanned beam delivery strategies using a combination of beam physical metrics. We expect to observe that compatibility of beam scanning with the mechanisms of the FLASH effect depends on the timing properties of applied scanning protocols. Therefore, the results will provide first guidelines for optimization and potential limitation in delivering FLASH-RT with scanned beams. . In addition to supporting the clinical transfer of FLASH-RT, the obtained results will have an impact on the industrial production of future FLASH machines by providing guidance on relaxing the requirements on beam size and intensity, simplifying thus the industrial production of such machines.",530720,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
En route to 3D Hanle diagnostics in stellar atmospheres: the observational perspective,"Probing the unresolved, weak component of the solar magnetic field in the photosphere is a crucial yet challenging task in astrophyisics. The term 'unresolved' implies that it cannot be detected through conventional diagnostic techniques like the Zeeman effect in spectro-polarimetric observations of spectral lines. While the Zeeman effect is prone to cancellations if the magnetic field is tangled on small spatial scales, the Hanle effect on the other hand is sensitive to this component of solar magnetism. The Hanle effect is usually detected via depolarization and rotation of spectral line polarization generated by scattering processes. To detect this change, two options are available: either a zero magnetic field reference polarization is calculated from sophisticated numerical models and compared to the observation, or many spectral lines with different Hanle sensitivities are compared, known as differential Hanle diagnostics. In the latter case, the need for the zero field reference calculation is eliminated and the inference of the magnetic field is soleley based on observations.For many decades the Hanle effect in the photosphere was investigated without any spatial resolution, and the zero reference calculations have been sufficiently carried out with one dimensional models. However, with recently available large aperture telescopes, and high-sensitivity and high zero-level-accuracy polarimetry, we are at the dawn of a new era in solar physics, where spatially resolved Hanle observations become available, awaiting many discoveries and new exciting questions to arise. The most accurate interpretation of these observations demand the zero level calculations to transit from 1D to 3D, which implies increasing the complexity of solar models, loads of computing resources, and the development of new numerical schemes - a very ambitious task with a lot of resources needed before the first data interpretation can be carried out. In this project, I focus on the observational perspective to interpret spatially resolved Hanle observations in spectral lines using atomic differential Hanle diagnostics. The greatest advantage is that this method can generate significantly faster results with significantly less computing resources. The project has the following objectives:  - identify suitable spectral line combinations for differential Hanle diagnsotics (including observational constraints),  - demonstrate the feasibility of the atomic differential Hanle effect by reproducing results from spatially unresolved measurements of the unresolved magnetic fields,  - determine the achievable accuracy of the magnetic field diagnostic, i.e. with results from existing 3D radiative transfer codes, e.g. PORTA,   - observe the polarized spectrum of the identified spectral lines with high spatial resolution,   - generate high resolution maps of the unresolved magnetic field, compare them with realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations including the small-scale dynamo, like CO5BOLD,While the framework build during this project will provide the solar community a very beneficial tool to interpret solar spectro-polarimetric scattering observations in a faster way,  the results will be of much broader importance: for the first time it will be possible to map the unresolved magnetic field in the photosphere, which also provides an independent result to ongoing attempts to invert the observations in the traditional way. This project creates the opportunity for Switzerland to establish a leading role in this topic in anticipation of large multi-national projects like the 4-m aperture European Solar Telescope.",530717,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
Collaborative Research: LSC Center for Coatings Research,"The detections of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015 launched the field of gravitational wave astronomy. The NSF-funded “A+” upgrade to Advanced LIGO is designed to achieve an order of magnitude increase in detection rate for black hole coalescences, and enable detection of fainter objects like binary neutron stars, greatly increasing their value for multi-messenger astronomy. The A+ upgrade and all 3rd generation detector designs depend on the development of mirrors with low coating thermal noise. The coating thermal noise is reduced, primarily, by lowering the mechanical (elastic) loss of the mirror materials. The core research focus of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) Center for Coatings Research (CCR) is the development of mirror coatings with low mechanical and optical losses for use in A+ and 3rd generation detectors. The research mission of the CCR includes: understanding and reducing mechanical loss in amorphous metal-oxides, the most widely-used materials in mirror coatings; and developing and testing crystalline (AlGaAs) coatings, which have demonstrated low losses for small mirrors. On a longer time-scale, the CCR is developing mirrors compatible with the proposed 3G detectors’ cryogenic operation. The residual noise visible in the time-domain gravitational waveforms of black hole mergers first recorded by Advanced LIGO is mostly due to quantum noise of the light and thermal noise due to the mirror coatings. Since that first discovery much progress has been made in reducing quantum noise and the coupling from seismic, scatter and jitter noise, leaving coating thermal noise as the dominant barrier limiting gravitational-wave astronomy in the most sensitive observation band. Reducing this noise source for future generations of detectors requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses, and forms the main goal of the CCR. The CCR combines groups working on computational modeling, coating deposition, and characterization of atomic structure and macroscopic material properties. These components are often performed by four diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these communities focused on a unified research goal. In its first two years of operation, research in the CCR has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. In addition, thermo-optically-optimized AlGaAs crystalline coatings have demonstrated a coating thermal noise well below the requirements for A+, and the CCR has generated a development schedule to scale up these coatings to LIGO mirror sizes and will continue investigations into these materials. Other research paths include: exploring deposition techniques to produce “ultrastable glasses” using amorphous metal-oxides; and stabilizing amorphous coatings against crystallization in order to allow elastic loss reduction via high temperature annealing either with nano-layering or with different doping materials.

Theory and Simulation of Laser-dressed Molecules and Materials,"Ignacio Franco of the University of Rochester is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop the theory and simulation of the emergent properties of matter when driven or “dressed” by lasers. Characterizing and controlling matter driven far from equilibrium by lasers represents a key challenge for science and technology. This is because matter can behave very differently when shaken by the intense coherent light provided by lasers. Further, lasers offer the possibility of manipulation on an ultrafast timescale (on the order of a millionth of one billionth of a second), something that is simply not achievable by more conventional means such as an applied voltage, chemical or thermodynamic control. The Franco group will develop general schemes for the laser control of electrons in matter and, in doing so, catalyze the development of a novel class of laser-dressed dynamical materials with effective properties that are tunable “on-demand"" on ultrafast time scales. For example, the group has pioneered schemes to use of light to drive ultrafast electronic currents and construct ultrafast logic gates that now enable information processing at the fastest time scales allowed by nature. In addition to its interest at a fundamental level, manipulating electron dynamics with lasers is the basis for the development of ultrafast electronics, switching, imaging, catalysis, and, in fact, any science and technology at large based on electrons and their control. The outreach activities of this proposal include the organization of annual conferences exploring quantum frontiers in molecular science, integrating research with education by developing a graduate course on “Quantum Dynamics”, and advancing initiatives to increase diversity in STEM at the University of Rochester. Specifically, the Franco group will investigate the fundamental limits in the quantum control of electrons and advance our capabilities to use intense ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate electronic properties and dynamics in nanostructures and extended systems. The general objective is to understand the ability of laser-dressed matter to absorb light, transport charge, and the use of light to control electron dynamics. For this the group will develop: (a) A Floquet theory and simulation scheme of the optical absorption properties of realistic laser-dressed solids as needed to make experimentally testable predictions and stimulate experimental progress. (b) The theory and simulation of the emergent field of petahertz electronics where strong few-cycle laser pulses are used to trigger femtosecond currents along nanoscale junctions. In particular, we aim at clarifying the role of the electrodynamic propagation of light in this complex electromagnetic environment in the current generation. (c) A practical scheme to capture radiation-matter interactions beyond the dipole approximation while avoiding cumbersome multipolar expansions. We will use it to quantify the influence of the spatial structure of light in nanojunctions in (b). The project will train 2 Ph.D. students in state-of-the-art methods in quantum dynamics and light-matter interactions. All codes developed as part of this project will be made available for general use through GitHub, impacting the ability of the broader scientific community to model strong light-matter interactions.

The ins and outs of star formation,"Using millimeter wave observations, astronomers can probe the structure of star forming regions. Understanding the star formation process will give us better insight on how the Earth and Sun formed and will help us better understand the changes of galaxies over time. Star formation takes place in the densest parts of molecular clouds, the regions referred to as stellar cores. The investigator seeks to understand how cores form and funnel material to the stars forming in them. The investigators will use the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to observe dense gas surrounding forming stars at different ages. Students of diverse backgrounds, from middle-school to graduate school, will take part in this project, and will gain experience in scientific research including analyzing and interpreting radio interferometer astronomical data. This research experience will attract underrepresented minorities to the physical sciences. Another goal is to educate the public on radio astronomy, interferometry and star formation using the ALMA observations obtained during this project for exhibits and planetarium shows. Millimeter interferometer observations of star-forming regions will be used to probe the gas in envelopes within hundreds to thousands of astronomical units of the protostars in order to determine how material goes from the cloud in towards the inner circumstellar envelope and the protostellar system, as a consequence of gravitational infall, and how it is expelled out of the envelope due to the impact of protostellar outflows. The project aims to establish how infall and outflow rates change of over the lifetime of envelopes and understand the relative effect of infall and outflow at different stages of the protostars' mass-assembling and cores' mass-loss processes. The project will also establish the importance of outflows in the removal of the dense core gas and how outflows impact the infalling material as protostars evolve. The results will be used to develop an empirical model of the evolution of the mass-assembling process in low-mass protostars and to constrain numerical simulations of feedback in star-forming cores.

Understanding topological excitons via ultrafast and helicity-dependent photocurrent microscopy,"Nontechnical Description: Topological materials represent a new family of materials with exciting and unique electronic properties, which offer promise of revolutionizing electronics and computers. Most of the prior research treated electrons in these materials as noninteracting particles. However, under certain conditions, electrons may strongly interact with their counterparts, holes, which are vacancies of electrons. In this case, quasiparticles made of electron and hole pairs, which are often referred to as excitons, may form a quantum state with exotic properties such as transport without energy dissipation. Topological excitons may provide new and exciting paradigm of exploiting excitons instead of electrons for higher temperature quantum computing. This project focuses on understanding excitons in topological materials, which is based on the principal investigator’s recent results of fast and long-distance transport of photogenerated charge carriers in topological insulators at low temperatures. The project uses innovative experimental techniques including spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements, to offer key insights for fundamental understanding of the nature of topological excitons. This project also provides opportunities for educating and training undergraduate and graduate students in the critical areas of quantum and spintronic devices, nanodevice fabrication, and topological materials. Technical Description: Excitons formed at topological surface states can be protected against back-scattering and enjoy robust spin-polarization, providing a truly promising route to quantum devices and spintronic applications. Although single-particle physics has been extensively investigated, much less work has been carried out to understand excitons in these materials. Recent experimental studies of single-crystalline Sb-doped Bi2Se3 nanoribbons conducted by the principal investigator have revealed fast relaxation and ballistic transport of photogenerated carriers, strongly suggesting a possibility of highly dissipationless transport of photogenerated charge carriers in topological insulators. This project aims to uncover properties of the photogenerated excitons such as their velocity, lifetime, spin, and effects of magnetic field. Spatially resolved ultrafast pump-probe photocurrent measurements are used to determine the relaxation time and propagation velocity of excitons. Spatially resolved helicity-dependent photocurrent measurements in the visible and mid-infrared range are performed to better understand the exciton spin polarization and the momentum coupling properties at the surface. Optically modulated magnetoresistance measurements are carried out to understand the effect of magnetic field on exciton transport. This project helps graduate and undergrad students to acquire skills and knowledge to pursue research and development in the field of novel materials and quantum technologies in collaboration with industrial partners. The broader impact activities of the project are also integrated into the Cal-Bridge and American Physical Society Bridge programs, dedicated to mentoring underrepresented minority students, toward advanced degrees in physics.

"WoU-MMA: Holistic Simulations of Black Hole Powered Stellar Explosions: Nucleosynthesis, Jets, and Multimessenger Emission","When a massive star runs out of fuel, its core collapses under its own weight. The core gets so dense that it can form a black hole that feasts on the rest of the star. Such objects are called collapsars. Scientists have long suspected that collapsars can produce heavy elements, including gold and platinum. However, how much of the heavy elements, with which we interact in our day-to-day life, comes from collapsars has remained a mystery. This is because black holes are fussy eaters and burp away most of the star instead of swallowing it. This makes it hard for the scientists to answer the crucial question: What role do collapsars play in creating the heavy elements, which enrich our everyday lives? A team led by Northwestern University will use a three-year award to investigate these questions. The investigators will involve under-represented minority undergraduate and graduate students in their research. They will inspire with their research undergraduate students by teaching classes as part the Northwestern Prison Education Program. They will give guest lectures at local high schools. They will reach the broader public by sharing the collapsar and guest lecture videos in planetaria, via social media and press releases. Because collapsars produce multimessenger emission – gravitational waves and a wide range of electromagnetic counterparts – and leave behind black holes whose mergers can later produce gravitational waves, they are prime targets of NSF flagship facilities, such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and Vera Rubin observatories. However, no models directly connecting the pre-collapse progenitor star to the newly formed black hole and to the gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts currently exist. The investigators will combine neutrino transport numerical relativity simulations with 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations that start with the pre-collapse stellar structure, describe the stellar core collapse and formation of the black hole, model the subsequent explosion for a duration of tens of seconds post-collapse, and then follow the expanding ejecta for 100 s, until it reaches homology. The main objectives are to constrain the origin of heavy elements, mechanisms of jet-powered hypernova explosions, the nature of multimessenger emission, and the properties of black hole remnants. The numerical schemes and atlas of multimessenger light curves developed here will be made public, directly connecting the pre-collapse stellar structure to multimessenger observables. The proposed work responds to the “Windows on the Universe: Multimessenger Astrophysics” theme.

A Search for Self-Lensing Compact Binaries with the Zwicky Transient Facility,"The Milky Way galaxy is home to possibly as many as 100,000,000 black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), known collectively as compact objects. However, by their very nature, compact objects are very difficult to detect. Most compact objects, particularly BHs, are detected through their close interaction with a normal star companion, a relatively rare situation. A research program at the University of Washington aims to expand the search for compact objects by looking for them in “detached” binary star systems, in which the star and compact object orbit each other but do not interact. They will do this using archival data from the NSF-supported Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), developing and applying novel methods for identifying gravitational self-lensing, in which light from the companion star is repeatedly gravitationally lensed as the compact object passes in front of it, creating a periodic brightening pulse. Student training integral to this work will involve undergraduate and graduate students in data-intensive discovery and position them competitively for a wide range of STEM careers. Citizen scientists will help vet candidate self-lensing systems, providing an opportunity for them to engage in leading-edge scientific research. The inventory of Galactic BH and NS binaries remains both highly incomplete and biased towards the most extreme interacting systems. In particular, poor observational constraints on the rate and spatial distribution of unseen but numerous non-accreting compact binaries currently limit our knowledge of stellar and binary evolution, including the effects of the initial mass function and supernova natal kicks. Drawing on the team’s experience with ZTF data, they will conduct a systematic search for Galactic self-lensing binaries among the more than 4.7 billion archival light curves provided by ZTF. They will employ multiple approaches to identify self-lensing signals at a wide range of binary orbital periods. These will include flare searches in ZTF continuous-cadence data, residual searches in ellipsoidal variables, and box-least-squares periodicity searches in sparsely sampled survey data. Follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations will enable confirmation of candidates and refinement of the derived system parameters. Population synthesis modeling of the resulting candidates will enable new constraints on the mass, orbital period, and spatial distribution of compact objects and reveal poorly-probed phases of binary evolution. Training a graduate student to use these tools will help advance the NSF objective to grow a diverse, globally-competitive STEM workforce. Mentorship of minoritized undergraduates through the University of Washington’s Pre-Major in Astronomy Program as well as in paid summer research will increase the involvement of communities under-represented in STEM.

Computational Astrophysics: From Planet Formation to Improved Learning,"This project at Iowa State University uses computer simulations to study planet formation and to teach the core principles of astronomy and computational science in a way that aligns with educational standards. There are two crucial, yet unresolved, questions regarding how planets form. First, how can parcels of protoplanetary disk material trade angular momentum? Second, how do planetesimals (e.g., asteroids and comets) form? The grant also supports the development of a novel website comprised of simulation movies and interactive widgets, named the “Computational Astrophysics Lab” (CAL). It will result in the teaching of students (ranging from high school students from underrepresented and underserved populations to graduate students) in astronomy and scientific research. The streaming instability is the current leading model for planetesimal formation, and previous simulations of this process overproduce planetesimals compared with Solar System observations. To solve this issue, the investigators propose a novel mechanism involving gas turbulence that regulates planetesimal formation. This project also focuses on studies of angular momentum transport through numerical simulations and comparisons with observations. Thus, the proposed research would address (1) how angular momentum is transported outward in protoplanetary disks and (2) whether gas turbulence in disks can regulate the formation of planetesimals. The development of the new educational tool will provide a friendly user interface to a sophisticated code. It will be employed at three different levels: (1) The CAL will provide a basic understanding of astronomy and scientific computing to high school students from underrepresented & underserved populations from across Iowa. (2) In introductory astronomy courses, the CAL will produce visualizations of astrophysical processes, which will make complex processes understandable on an intuitive, visually based learning level. (3) Finally, the CAL will provide graduate students with a hands-on approach to learning difficult concepts in computational physics via source code and tutorials.

"NSF-BSF: Chemistry, Properties, Self-Organization and Phase Transitions of Boron-Nitride Nanotubes","With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Angel A. Martí and Matteo Pasquali of Rice University are developing chemical methods to control the surface functionalities and physical properties in nanotubes made from the chemical elements boron and nitrogen. Boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are tubular nanoarchitectures, similar in structure to carbon nanotubes (CNT), but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbon. BNNTs have particular properties, such as high thermal conductivity (similar to copper), wide band gap, chemical and thermal stability, and high Young’s modulus (stiffness). As such, BNNTs are highly desirable building blocks with applications in aerospace materials, heat and chemically resistant composites, radiation shielding, and electrical insulators with high thermal conductivity. This research has the potential to advance the knowledge of surface functionalization of chemically inert BNNTs through a systematic covalent modification approach. The research team will promote and recruit underserved students from diverse backgrounds through ongoing collaborations with Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), the Chemistry Department at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras and Mayagüez, and the Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity in Education at Rice University. The team will also continue service and outreach through the Research and Leadership Enabling Advanced Discoveries (RLEAD) in Nanosciences REU program, Rice Emerging Scholar Program (RESP), and Chemistry Graduate Education for Minorities program (ChemGem). The central proposition supporting this research is that covalent bond formation and non-covalent functionalization, such as surfactant wrapping, will tune the chemical and physical characteristics of boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), favoring the emergence of desirable properties and self-organization into supramolecular assemblies. The research goals will be accomplished by pursuing the following objectives: (i) understand and control the reaction of pnictogen oxides with BNNTs and (ii) develop a universal surface functionalization methodology based on BNNT fluorination. Additionally, detailed dispersion studies using cryo-EM and cryo-SEM will be conducted by the Talmon Group in Israel to gain a better understanding of the interactions between surfactants and BNNT and the liquid crystal morphology. The understanding gained through this research has the potential to accelerate the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, providing chemical and physical tunability to advanced building blocks for assembling materials with unique properties. Furthermore, the synergistic international research collaboration among the Martí and Pasquali laboratories in the U.S. and the Talmon laboratory in Israel will provide a unique research environment with expertise in chemistry, characterization, rheometry, and microscopy, and state-of-the-art characterization facilities at Rice University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.

BSM-PM: WoU-MMA: A Single Atom Microscope for Measuring the Ne-22 + He-4 Reaction,"Most of the chemical elements across the periodic table are formed inside of stars as the stars age and subsequently die. Roughly half the chemical elements that are heavier than iron, such as copper and silver, are formed by the slow capture of neutrons as certain types of stars age. The sources of these neutrons are nuclear reactions involving the capture of a helium nucleus by a neon nucleus. This particular nuclear reaction produces both a neutron and a magnesium nucleus and has a very low probability of taking place. The goal of this project is to develop and test a laser-based detector that is capable of efficiently capturing all the product magnesium atoms and selectively identifying and counting them with single atom sensitivity. In the first phase of this project, the atom capture and laser detection process will be studied and optimized. In the second phase, a proof-of-principle measurement using this new laser-based detector will be carried out. Eventually this laser-based detector and technique will be used to determine the cosmological origin of elements such as copper and silver. This project is the Ph.D. dissertation research for one graduate student and will also provide research experience to undergraduate students majoring in physics and astronomy. As a public outreach component of this project, the PI will produce a stand-alone planetarium show which tells the story of chemical element formation inside of stars. The program can be delivered at planetariums around the country without the need for a live in-person narrator. This is an extension of the PI’s previous NSF-funded public outreach activities and will provide scientific training and experience to additional undergraduate students majoring in the creative arts. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using optical single atom detection in cryogenic noble gas solids for detecting the atomic products of low yield nuclear reactions and rare nuclear decays. In the so-called Single Atom Microscope (SAM) technique, the recoiling product nucleus in the form of a neutral atom is implanted in and captured by a cryogenic noble gas solid host. The host solid can be grown sufficiently free of impurities, which minimizes optical backgrounds, and is adequately transparent at the relevant optical wavelengths, which allows for laser probing of the product atoms. Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) emitted by the product atoms is then imaged onto a CCD camera, which spatially resolves each individual product atom. Single atom detection of Ba in solid xenon has been demonstrated, while promising results for Rb in solid neon have also been reported. The motivation for developing the SAM technique includes measuring key nuclear reaction cross sections relevant for nuclear astrophysics and the search for neutrinoless double beta decay. Within the scope of this proposal over the next three years, the PI aims to first perform a proof-of-principle nuclear reaction cross section measurement of the Ne-22+alpha to neutron+Mg-25 nuclear reaction at a well-known resonance to ``shake down'' the technique. This will first require measurements of the fluorescence yield of neutral Mg in solid Ne as well as attempts to demonstrate the optical single atom detection of Mg in solid Ne. The long-term goal is to perform the definitive nuclear cross section measurements of the Ne-22+alpha reactions. Roughly half of the elements heavier than iron are produced by the slow neutron capture process (s-process) inside of stars. One of the key sources of neutrons that feeds the s-process is the Ne-22+alpha to neutron+Mg-25 reaction. Using the SAM technique, coupled with a modest recoil separator for isotope selectivity, to measure these reactions by detecting the product Mg atoms would provide a crucial independent cross check of complementary completed and planned experiments. This proposal is a step towards developing the SAM technique for this application. Along the way, this project will add to the knowledge of the laser induced fluorescence behavior of atoms inside noble gas solids which has applications in detection for nuclear astrophysics, quantum sensing, and tagging for neutrinoless double beta decay searches.

RUI: Three Dimensional Complex Light Forms,"While most familiar light beams, such as those from a laser pointer, have a relatively simple structure and intensity pattern, far more complex structures are possible. These structures are of interest both intrinsically and for potential practical applications. Deliberate manipulation of the phase and intensity of light beams can create patterns in three dimensions that have focal lines along curved paths, rotate or transform the light's transverse pattern as it travels, or have points along its wavefront that oscillate in unison but with patterned orientations. The goal of this research project is to explore techniques for the creation of novel three-dimensional patterns including those that may be of interest for applications. The PI and his undergraduate research team will look for inspiration in the connections between optical beams in the laboratory and other physical systems, such as - on the cosmic scale – the deflection of light by gravity around astrophysical objects and – on the microscale – oscillations of a pendulum governed by quantum mechanics. Connecting these diverse physical systems and size scales is possible due to the similarities in the mathematical structure of these problems and the wave equation of the light. Within this framework, the research team will also investigate communication via the rotation of patterned beams and new types of optical beams with low divergence. Similarities between quantum entanglement and wave behavior also give rise to new parallels that are of interest to pursue. In addition to basic research, the team will incorporate research outcomes into undergraduate laboratory experiences thereby making a direct connection between research and undergraduate classroom/lab instruction. The training of undergraduate students in basic research, and the development of instructional laboratories which can be used by many institutions, will help prepare students to join the emerging quantum workforce. The manipulation of light’s degrees of freedom in polarization, spatial mode, momentum, energy, and photon number can lead to novel patterns in three dimensions that are of fundamental interest and can lead to applications in biomedical imaging and communications. Via table-top optics experiments, amenable to the undergraduate setting, the PI and his students will study novel problems that harness the similarity in mathematical structure between light’s wave equation and other physical systems, such as cosmic gravitational lensing and atomic and molecular nonlinear oscillations. The outcomes are three-dimensional patterns that carry caustics and vortex singularities, which are novel in their own right and can be exploited for new applications. One such application is in communications where the information is encoded in the rotation of beam patterns. At the quantum level, parallels between photon entanglement and classical optical metrology are also expected to harness new types of non-local metrology. This award will support the continuation of an ongoing program in the development and dissemination of instructional quantum optics laboratories which serve to connect research with instruction. These laboratories will help educate the emerging quantum information workforce at and beyond the PI’s home institution.

The Population and Evolution of Dual AGNs at Radio Wavelengths: Predictions for the ngVLA,"Astronomers predict that most massive galaxies in the Universe will have merged with at least one other massive galaxy during their lifetime. As supermassive black holes inhabit the centers of massive galaxies, scientists therefore expect to find that a fraction of galaxies will have a pair of black holes at their centers. The orbit of these black holes will slowly decay, and the two black holes will interact with their surroundings and shine brightly. This research team will develop an innovative model of how these dual black holes shine at radio wavelengths. A web interface developed as part of this project will allow anyone to access a database of predicted radio bright black holes and plan observations to search for them. The investigators will also develop a workshop on oral communications skills for graduate students at Georgia Tech. Results of the workshops and lessons-learned will be published. This research team will develop an innovative model of dAGN activity at radio wavelengths and is built on four pillars: (1) the catalog of massive galaxy mergers predicted by the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, (2) calculations of the orbital evolution at kpc-scales due to gaseous and stellar dynamical friction of a secondary SMBH in a post-merger galaxy, (3) the relativistic jet power found from simulations of moving black holes through magnetized gas, and (4) first-principles modeling of the radio synchrotron spectrum from the jet cores. By considering different SMBH orbits in each IllustrisTNG merger, the model will generate catalogs of kpc-scale dAGNs as a function of redshift, with each system associated with a specific evolution of the dAGN radio luminosity and spectrum. A web interface developed as part of this project will allow access to the model database and provide actionable predictions on the expected radio source properties from ngVLA surveys of post-merger galaxies.

Unraveling intertwined orders with precision magneto-optic microscopy,"Non-technical description: New functionalities could emerge in quantum materials when different yet related orders coexist, often referred to as “intertwined orders”. An important case is intertwined superconductivity and magnetism that are restricted to two dimensions, such as at the surface or interface. Such a scenario is extremely rare as the conditions for superconductivity and magnetism are usually mutually exclusive, yet the resulting new phases of matter are theoretically predicted to host exotic excitations useful as information carriers in quantum information technologies. In this work, the research team investigates the Fe-chalcogenide superconductors FeTe1-xSex (FTS), where intertwined superconductivity and magnetism have recently been discovered in the surface state. Precision magnetic microscopy and other experimental techniques are used to establish the rich magnetic and superconducting phase diagram, and to search for signatures of the predicted exotic excitations towards applications in magnetic sensing, energy-efficient electronics, and quantum information technologies. This project allows graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to take part in research and receive trainings in optics, cryogenics, precision measurement electronics, and programming. Through the outreach component, the research team reaches out to middle school students from disadvantaged regions in Santa Ana and motivates them to pursue careers in science and technology. Technical description: Highly correlated condensed matter systems are complex, with coexisting phases that are identified either by the topology of their electronic structure or through the spontaneous breaking of a certain symmetry. This complexity is recognized with “intertwined orders” due to their intimate relations and is technologically important due to the resulting new phases of matter. Of tremendous current interest is the correlated material system Fe-chalcogenide superconductors FeTe1-xSex (FTS) with rich intertwined orders. Using precision magneto-optic Sagnac imaging and transport techniques, the research team has recently established that the surface state is a topological magnetic metal with proximity-inherited superconducting order from the bulk, which remains superconducting but non-magnetic. As such, emerging phases of matter would occur in the surface state with predicted excitations called Majorana zero modes that promise important applications in quantum information technologies. In this project, the research team studies in an interconnected manner three forms of FTS: bulk crystal, exfoliated nano-flake, and atomic layers, to map out the phase diagram of intertwined orders as a function of chemical compositions, structure, and other external stimuli. The obtained information provides the basis for the search for signatures of predicted Majorana zero modes, their propagation at the boundary between adjacent crystal faces, as well as the manipulation of these excitations for potential devices. Through a hands-on outreach program, the research team interacts with students from the local disadvantaged Santa Ana area and motivates them to pursue careers in STEM.

SMA-SPEC: A Legacy Spectral Line Survey of Protoplanetary Disks,"Planets form in disks around young stars. Disk chemistry affects the outcome of planet formation in multiple ways, including elemental composition and access to water and prebiotically interesting organics for habitable zone planets. The chemistry of outer disk regions, beyond the water snowline, where comets and most giant planets likely form, can be studied using molecular emission lines at millimeter wavelengths. Molecular lines also offer some of the best probes of disk gas mass, density, temperature, and ionization. This project will use the Submillimeter Array to conduct a series of broadband line surveys towards 40 different disks. This project will form the thesis work of a graduate student. The team will also participate as YouthAstroNet STEM mentors and will answer student questions about astronomy as well as STEM career pathways. The research team will survey 120 GHz of bandwidth between 210 and 370 GHz at high spectral resolution towards 40 disks. They have already obtained 120 tracks (nights) of SMA time to pursue a ~120 GHz spectral line survey towards 40 disks around solar mass T Tauri stars and Herbig Ae stars in clusters ranging from <1Myr to >5Myrs. The team will use the survey data to address the C/O elemental ratio, quantify D/H ratios, and obtain a comprehensive inventory of the organic reservoir in the comet-forming disk regions. A grid of astrochemical models using the disk chemistry code DALI will be run to determine abundance structures, which will be converted to column density profiles and disk-averaged column densities and column density ratios for easy comparison with the observations. This unique data set will be highly significant for interpretative frameworks of exoplanets habitability and the origins of solar system volatiles.

Singlular structure of two-loop amplitudes and their numerical evaluation,"The LHC experiments have achieved remarkable advances in precision. They are currently observing and studying rare processes involving many heavy quark and electroweak particles with confidence. Perturbative QCD techniques struggle to handle the numerous kinematic scales and Feynman diagrams beyond the next-to-leading order.Our goal is to develop a novel subtraction method for making two-loop amplitudes finite in momentum space. With this technique, we will create finite integrands for high multiplicity processes at the LHC, which are central to its precision physics program. Lastly, we will work on numerical methods to integrate the remaining finite amplitudes in momentum space. I believe that our approach presents a unique solution to challenging multiscale processes at the next-to-next-to-leading order, as other analytic and numerical methods face a steeper rise in computational cost with increasing final state complexity.",522616,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; United Kingdom,Switzerland,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
BSM-PM: Testing Fundamental Symmetries with A Novel Ytterbium Ion Clock,"Any systematic study of Nature, from exploring sub-atomic structures to observing remote galaxies, finds that the texture of our universe is highly symmetric. In other words, there is a set of fundamental symmetry principles, which appear to hold universally on all length scales and energy scales. For instance, Einstein's theory of relativity rests on the concept that spacetime is symmetric: The laws of physics are supposed to be the same in all inertial reference frames and the speed of light is assumed to be the same in all directions. But how well can we experimentally test such symmetry assumptions? Given that physicists have by now gathered overwhelming evidence that our current understanding of Nature is incomplete, symmetry test experiments are crucial when looking for hints of ""new physics"" beyond the established models. In this project, the PI and his team want to further improve the precision of tests of fundamental symmetries by developing a particularly sensitive quantum detector for potential symmetry violations. They propose that a novel optical atomic clock based on ytterbium ions in a low-temperature environment may discover minute asymmetries or can deliver improved bounds on several potential symmetry violations. This project will also provide training for graduate and undergraduate students. These students will develop technical skills related to the research, as well as critical scientific judgment. More specifically, the team wants to investigate via high-precision laser spectroscopy a so far unexplored optical electric octupole (E3) transition in singly-charged ytterbium 173 confined in a cryogenic ion trap. Compared with measurements in room-temperature environments, black body radiation induced frequency shifts will be reduced to a negligible level. Similarly, frequency-shifting background gas collisions will be strongly suppressed. The improved spectroscopic precision combined with favorable atomic properties of the 173-Yb ion will make it possible to turn this optical atomic clock into a very sensitive antenna for potential effects of new physics beyond the Standard Model, e.g., the coupling of dark matter to quarks and gluons and violations of Lorentz symmetry in the strong force and electromagnetic sectors.

Equipment: MRI: Track 1 Acquisition of a Laboratory-based Instrument for in situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy,"This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a laboratory-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) instrument for spectroscopic studies to probe the chemical state, electronic structure, and local coordination environment of atoms that underpins research questions spanning materials science, chemistry, geosciences, environmental sciences, chemical engineering, and condensed matter physics including in catalysis, functional materials, metallurgy, and metals in medicine. This laboratory-based instrument overcomes limitations associated with traditional XAS measurements at large synchrotron facilities. Regular instrument access allows feedback for material synthesis efforts, and long duration studies of transformations that occur over months. As needed, measurements can be coordinated with specialized sample preparation facilities at Stony Brook University and can be integrated with advanced sample environments and controls. The instrument facilitates training of the next generation of instrumentalists, with its virtual beamline layout providing trainees the opportunity to design, test, and optimize new experiments and instrumentation—activities that are difficult to accommodate at synchrotron beamlines. The instrument broadens participation in science and engineering research by providing a research capability, that could previously only be accessed through travel to synchrotrons, which may be inaccessible to some individuals. Undergraduate trainees at Stony Brook University and the nearby Farmingdale State College are introduced to XAS as a tool for advanced characterization measurements. The XAS instrument operates as a multi-user facility housed within the Chemistry Department at Stony Brook University. High quality spectra can be acquired for elements from Ti to Nb, and I to Am, using a high-powered X-ray tube coupled to modern X-ray optics and detectors. Acquisition of multiple spectra in short time frames allows for high-throughput sample characterization, and real-time tracking of reaction processes to enable operando studies of catalysis, to understand functional materials, to resolve open questions in metallurgy, and to interrogate redox states fundamental to geosciences and environmental science. The utility and utilization of the instrument is optimized through use of custom multi-sample changers, specific to different sample formats and sample environments and reactors are optimized for studies of dynamic states and reactions. Key projects enabled addresses the local structure of mono and heterometallic molecular catalysts, the mechanism for capacity loss in battery electrodes, and the progressively degradation of selective gas-binding in porous sorbents and catalysts over months-years of operation.

Collaborative Research: SWIFT-SAT: Minimizing Science Impact on LSST and Observatories Worldwide through Accurate Predictions of Satellite Position and Optical Brightness,"Due to increasing numbers of satellites, particularly in non-Geostationary (nGSO) orbit, impacts from optical reflections to key astronomical systems such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are anticipated to be profound without mitigation. Such mitigation may take several forms, but predictions of satellite locations and brightness will likely play a key role in avoidance of optical interference. This work includes development of software designed to produce these predictions based upon observed tracking data for satellites, and produce expected errors introduced in ground-based astronomical observatories. This will make better avoidance of such errors possible. This work brings together a consortium of experts to quantify and ultimately mitigate impacts on two key LSST science goals as well as develop software for use by ground-based astronomers. The PIs intend to leverage a collaboration with Aerospace Corporation to produce predictive data on satellite brightness and location. Brightness predictions will make use of a novel tool, Lumos-Sat, that enables Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) fitting to both laboratory and on-orbit observational data. Further, data collected through a network of engaged observers at the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS) SatHub, as well as early LSST data, will be analyzed to validate the accuracy of the software (“SatChecker”) predictions. This information will be used to develop an analysis of errors introduced by satellite streaks in LSST observing programs.

Quantum Many-Body Dynamics of Matter and Light in Cavity QED,"The overarching goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the quantum dynamics of many-body systems through the study of ultracold atoms coupled to light in a high-finesse optical cavity. This setup offers an unprecedented level of control of external potentials, interactions, and dissipation, with precise real-time monitoring. We will test existing paradigms as well as develop and benchmark new theoretical models. Three theoretical groups, two in Germany (MPIPKS and Saarbrücken University)  and one in Austria (Innsbruck University), combine expertise from quantum optics and atomic physics with many-body theory (computational and field-theoretical) and statistical physics. Experiments will be performed by the Swiss nodes at ETHZ and at EPFL. Taken together, these two groups represent more than one third of all quantum gases in cavity experiments worldwide and are complementary in terms of quantum statistics (bosonic versus fermionic atoms), characteristic timescales, as well as types of interatomic interactions.In particular, the project aims at exploring quantum metastability originating from cavity-mediated interactions and its competition with short-range interatomic interactions, from constraints like gauge invariance, or from the tendency of the system to form localised states in the form of self-bound droplets. A central role in the investigations is played by drive and dissipation, not only in modifying the scenarios just mentioned, but also in creating novel stationary or also non-stationary many-body states. In addition, cavity-induced dissipation will be explored as a resource for reducing entropy and improving quantum algorithms such as optimization.",512757,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Germany; Austria,Switzerland,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Exploration of the Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics of Turbulent Collisionless Plasmas,"This project will explore turbulent plasmas using novel statistical mechanics methods. Statistical mechanics is a core branch of physics that has been enormously successful in describing the physical characteristics of matter such as gases, liquids, and quantum fields. However, it has been challenging to extend its principles to describe hot tenuous plasmas that exist throughout the Universe, including the solar wind, the interstellar medium, and matter around black holes. This project will use computer simulations and new mathematical methods to explore the statistical mechanics of turbulent plasmas. The result will be an improved capability to predict the multiscale behavior of plasmas in astrophysical, space, and laboratory systems, including potential future fusion energy reactors. The methods will be used to model the occurrence of high-energy particles and radiation produced by the plasma, which can be compared to observations. The project will engage graduate students and include public outreach and undergraduate mentoring programs. The project considers the dissipation of collisionless plasma turbulence from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. It will involve the application of new theoretical approaches for quantifying irreversible energy dissipation in nonequilibrium systems. The team will perform and analyze kinetic and hybrid-kinetic simulations of plasma turbulence in different physical regimes, including relativistic and non-relativistic cases, to determine (1) the statistical distribution of entropy production rates in turbulence, and (2) whether turbulent energy dissipation leads to generalized maximum entropy states that can be modeled analytically. The outcome will be an improved understanding of turbulent energy dissipation in collisionless plasmas, leading to new models of nonthermal particle acceleration and subsequent radiation emission. The work has direct applications to a broad range of space and astrophysical systems, including the solar wind and black-hole accretion flows. Beyond this, it will lead to insights relevant to other dissipative plasma processes, such as magnetic reconnection and shocks, and nonequilibrium statistical systems in general.

Quantum Simulation with a Floquet Engineered Array of Interacting Molecules,"Quantum mechanics has unlocked countless technologies that benefit society, including lasers and precise measurements of time that enable the precision of GPS. These technologies rely on the quantum properties of atoms and molecules as though each particle is in isolation, whereas technologies reliant on the entanglement between particles are still in development. Exciting applications include quantum simulators, which may discover new materials with quantum properties, such as the absence of electrical resistance. Under a prior award, the PI and her team developed techniques to engineer individually controlled interactions between molecules. The current project will expand the number of individually controlled molecules and use these to model simple quantum materials for calibration, so that ultimately the team will be able to study useful complex materials. This process of pursuing new techniques in the control of quantum particles will also train and educate students and postdocs, contributing to the quantum workforce in industry, academia, and national labs. Furthermore, training will be enhanced by a new modern course on quantum molecular physics to be developed by the PI. Quantum simulation has excited many in the AMO and quantum science community with the idea that arrays of controllable, interacting particles can reveal the physics of correlated many-body systems by reproducing their Hamiltonians. This project aims to create a quantum simulator of spin dynamics consisting of a configurable array of ultracold dipolar molecules, assembled atom by atom and held in individual optical tweezers. In particular, the PI and her students will use Floquet-engineered microwave pulse sequences to tune the molecular Hamiltonian to match that of quantum materials like the antiferromagnetic bosonic t-J model, the XXZ spin model, and synthetic dimension lattices. Properties, and the efficiency of producing these quantum phases, will be studied. Supported by a prior award, the research group has prepared molecules in single quantum states and their rotation has been coherently controlled. In this new work the research team will entangle the rotation of adjacent molecules, and develop new microwave pulse sequences to control molecular rotation in order to engineer target Hamiltonians.

Leveraging Curvilinear Coordinates for Long-term and Accurate Simulations of Compact Binary Inspirals and Mergers,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. Recent gravitational wave detections from binary black hole and neutron star mergers have revolutionized astrophysics, providing new insights into fields such as general relativity, cosmology, nuclear physics, and astronomy. Future observations from both Earth-based and space-based detectors will extend our understanding of these phenomena and the formation of supermassive black holes. The principal investigators plan to develop new GPU-enabled algorithms and computational tools to accurately model accreting binary black hole and neutron star mergers. These tools will utilize both Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates to model complex systems, enhancing stability and accuracy while simulating the entire merger process of binary neutron star (BNS) systems and supermassive black hole binaries (SMBBHs). Additionally, the PI's team works on ""Astrodance,"" an artistic show with RIT's NTID performers that integrates dance, ASL, music, and digital storytelling to depict scientific visualizations of mergers. Public outreach efforts will include participating in events such as ""ImagineRIT"" and presentations on topics such as compact binary mergers and gravitational waves. By optimizing codes and grids within heterogeneous systems, the project aims to extend the duration of simulations for both the pre-merger and post-merger phases. This will enable enhanced long-term tracking of post-merger BNS systems and more efficient simulation of accreting SMBBHs. Additionally, the tools will calculate observables such as gravitational wave signatures, electromagnetic outputs, jet production, and nucleosynthesis-shaped outflows, thereby deepening our understanding of compact binary mergers. A public data repository will disseminate the project's findings to the scientific community. The team will also collaborate on several educational and outreach initiatives at RIT, including a multimessenger astronomy REU program and an NSF-funded PAARE project aimed at supporting hard-of-hearing and Hispanic students.

Multiterminal Graphene Josephson Junctions,"Non-technical abstract: The research focuses on the development and understanding of a novel type of quantum devices, the “multiterminal Josephson junctions”. Conventionally, Josephson junctions are made of two superconductors – materials in which electric current can flow without resistance – connected through a non-superconducting region. The principal investigator’s team has recently made Josephson junctions with several superconducting regions connected together. The breakthrough became possible by making the non-superconducting region from graphene – a single atomic monolayer of graphite. Graphene is known to be ballistic – in can conduct electrons over large distances without scattering – enabling efficient coupling between multiple superconducting terminals. The project enhances understanding of the multiterminal Josephson junctions, which are both expected to have fascinating physical properties and may eventually find applications in future quantum devices. The research also contributes to training of students on all levels in quantum nanotechnology. The project includes outreach in the local community, with a special focus on broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. Technical abstract: This project builds on the recent progress achieved by this research team and other groups in making multi-terminal Josephson junctions. One of the central themes of this work is the analogy between the Andreev bound states in a multiterminal Josephson junction and the band structure of a crystal. In particular, it has been predicted that multiterminal Josephson junction could be used to emulate topologically nontrivial bands containing Weyl points. These bands can be explored to search for the predicted topological signatures, such as the quantized transconductance. The project further aims to look for the predicted topological contributions to the multiplet resonances. Finally, the team plans to explore the physics of the “Josephson triode” – a tunable superconducting diode recently realized in this type of samples – with a particular focus on its topological properties. Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have been touted as “synthetic topological matter” which should offer new insights into the role of topology in condensed matter systems. The project intends to enhance our understanding of these structures, which is relevant to a whole class of hybrid superconductors samples. The multi-terminal Josephson junctions are both expected to have fascinating physical properties and may eventually find applications in quantum microwave devices.

Collaborative Research: Studying the Nature of the Higgs Boson and Searching for New Physics at the Large Hadron Collider with the ATLAS Experiment.,"ATLAS is a multi-purpose particle physics detector situated around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, just outside of Geneva, Switzerland. The goal of the ATLAS Collaboration’s physics program is to explore the fundamental nature of the universe at the smallest distance scales and highest energies achieved in a controlled environment. In July of 2022, the LHC restarted operations at a record center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV for proton-proton collisions, marking the beginning of Run 3 where more than 200 fb−1 of data is expected to be collected. This award will explore this new energy regime and the large dataset will allow for precision testing of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM), measurement of the properties of the Higgs Boson and its couplings, and the search for undiscovered particles and phenomena such as heavy bosons, gravitons, dark matter, and leptoquarks. At the end of 2025, the LHC will enter the next long shutdown where it will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) that will provide record numbers of proton-proton collisions at a design center of mass energy of 14 TeV. During this shutdown, the work of this award will contribute to the replacement of the entire inner tracking detector with the Inner Tracker Upgrade (ITk) so that ATLAS is able to provide precision track information for the more than 200 simultaneous collisions expected every 25ns. This award supports the research of the California State University (CSU) ATLAS group, including PIs at CSU Sacramento and CSU East Bay along with a diverse student population of undergraduate researchers in the CSU system. The group will collect and analyze data during Run 3 and study the Higgs boson by examining events which produce pairs of Higgs bosons (HH). This process can be used as a precision test of the SM, in particular probing the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Additionally Higgs pair production can be used to search for new scalar particles, predicted in a number of Beyond the Standard Model theories. In preparation for the HL-LHC, the CSU ATLAS group will work as members of the ATLAS ITk group to design, build, and install components of the Inner Pixel tracker that will be integrated into ATLAS in 2028. The focus of the ITk work will be on the production and integration of the ITk Inner Pixel modules and the Detector Control System (DCS) which includes the development of software and user interfaces. Undergraduates will be involved in all aspects of the proposed CSU ATLAS research program and will participate in collaborative science, data analysis, and in instrumentation testing at the campus laboratories as well as at SLAC and CERN. Supporting CSU students on their paths to physics graduate school and careers in science will have a significant impact on diversifying the physics workforce of the future.

Electron transport in low-dimensional and mesoscopic topological solids,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY One of the most amazing low-temperature properties of some materials is the phenomenon of superconductivity. Occurring at very low temperatures (possibly only a few degrees above the absolute zero), superconductivity allows electric current to pass through a material without any resistance. Despite the challenges posed by the need for cryogenic cooling, superconductivity finds a wide range of applications. These include superconducting coils in hospital MRI machines, magnetic field sensors in medical and industrial laboratories, and detectors and amplifiers of very weak electromagnetic signals, to name a few. In the recent decades, superconductivity emerged as the basis for the most viable designs of quantum computers. Concurrently, new superconducting materials were discovered, some of which are only a few-atoms thick. These include structures based on graphene -- a one-atom-thick two-dimensional crystal cleaved from graphite (the common material in pencil leads) -- and structures combining layers of conventional semiconductors and superconductors. The appearance of new materials and uses for superconductivity calls for theoretical developments which would enable the materials study and guide the design of new superconducting devices. This research project covers three specific directions within this broad task. Superconductivity is a quintessential quantum phenomenon. The mobile electrons in a material form a collective state, or condensate, due to an effective attraction between the electrons. Exciting an electron from the condensate requires a finite energy. This energy gap leads to the zero electric resistance of a superconductor. The “glue” capable of changing the conventional repulsion between electrons to an effective attraction may consist of quanta of vibrations, or phonons, of the host material. In one of the directions of this research project, we will develop a theory for measuring phonon properties using a newly developed tool, the Quantum Twisting Microscope. The two other directions of the project aim at investigating the effects of magnetic field and material imperfections on the properties of the novel superconductors. The new graphene-based superconductors are special because of the unusually low electron density in them; this may substantially alter how magnetic field affects superconductivity. Investigating superconductivity in materials with low density of electrons is the first of these two directions. The other direction aims at studying the role of material defects in the so-called topological superconductors. The electron condensate in such materials may simultaneously reside in two (or more) quantum states, which is a prerequisite for quantum computing. Unlike the conventional superconductors (such as aluminum), topological superconductors are sensitive to the structural disorder of the host material. Our research will aim to determine the length limits that allow a wire to retain the properties of a topological superconductor. Graduate students will be actively involved in the research and will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The Principal Investigator also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-experts. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This project aims to develop the electron transport theory of low-dimensional and mesoscopic conductors with topologically nontrivial single-particle or collective states. The emphasis is placed on theory applicable to superconductor-semiconductor hybrids and van der Waals materials exhibiting superconductivity. The motivation comes from the advances in engineering of new materials, experimental techniques enabling the high-precision electron transport measurements, and from the challenges the evaluation of electric responses of such systems presents for the theory. The first part of the project is devoted to developing new probes of the topological superconducting phases. We focus on the vicinity of the transition point separating the topological phase from a trivial one. We aim to elucidate the signatures of the critical behavior, obscured by disorder, in the nonlocal conductance. The second part of the project aims to broaden the transport theory of two-dimensional superconductors in an out-of-plane magnetic field. The recently measured superconductivity in trilayer graphene points to an anomalously short coherence length in it. This raises a host of questions regarding the crossover between the weak- and strong-coupling limits of superconductivity and its manifestations in the magnetoresistance. The third part of the project develops a theory allowing to find the electron-phonon interaction parameters and the superconducting gap structure from the measurements of momentum-resolved electron tunneling using a new device, Quantum Twisting Microscope. This work will require a variety of techniques, including diagrammatic expansions, Fermi liquid theory, renormalization group theory, continuous medium theory, the use of exactly solvable models, and numerical methods. Graduate students will be actively involved in the research and will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The PI also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-experts.

Off the Beaten Track: Accelerating Discoveries with Unconventional Searches and Next-generation Pixel Detectors,"Countless hints, from natural phenomena like dark matter, to theoretical concerns such as the hierarchy puzzle, strongly suggest the existence of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles at energy scales probed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This award aims to address the question of why we’ve yet to see any evidence of these new particles thus far and enable discoveries by breaking traditional search paradigms and building next generation pixel detectors. The research funded by this award will also push the boundaries of the ATLAS experiment’s capabilities. This will ensure high quality science at the upcoming High Luminosity LHC by upgrading the ATLAS Pixel Detector, improving the overall tracking capabilities in the face of unprecedented pile-up. The broader impacts of this award extend beyond enabling discoveries at high energy colliders. The research funded by this award represents a complete program for training students and postdocs. Data analysis techniques and instrumentation are shared with the wider scientific community and industry. In particular, developing cross-cutting technologies such as silicon sensors and microelectronics is integral to enriching the broader scientific landscape. Finally, this award will inspire the next generation of scientists through outreach programs that emphasize diversity, equity, and inclusion. The vast majority of LHC searches have focused on scenarios where high energy jets, photons, or leptons originate from the primary collision. However, many compelling BSM scenarios with long-lived particles may have evaded these constraints, resulting in displaced or anomalous tracks. One of the most exciting targets for the next LHC run is to follow up on an excess of events in a search for highly ionizing charged particles. This award will investigate this excess in a statistically independent dataset and extend our sensitivity by adding complementary measurements from the muon spectrometer. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",510000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
NSF-BSF: Uncovering the Physical Origin of Radio Emission in Radio-Quiet Quasars,"Understanding how galaxies formed and evolved to produce the Universe we see today is a high priority for the astrophysics community. The investigators will study the role played by super-massive black holes. These reside at the centers of most galaxies, which become ""active"" when gas, dust, and even stars fall into the black hole. This project addresses several aspects of the “active” galactic nuclei (AGN), such as the nature of the very compact X-ray-emitting region known as the corona, the mechanism that launches highly relativistic radio-wave-emitting plasma jets in a subset of AGN, and the origin of radio-wave emission in radio-quiet AGN. This project seeks to determine the origin of the radio emission and to use it as a probe of the super-massive black hole. This program will provide training opportunities for junior scientists, supporting postdocs, a graduate student, undergraduate researchers and summer. The project's research and educational work will also benefit the larger community through outreach activities in partnership with the UMBC Campus observatory, local schools, and artists in the NASA/MICA partnership program. Several physical processes can contribute to the radio emission observed from AGN, including extreme star formation, hot gas associated with the compact X-ray emitting ""corona"" very near the black hole, shocks from relativistic winds, and nascent, small-scale, and/or failed relativistic jets. This project includes two complimentary investigations. The first is focused on a comprehensive study (multi-band radio and X-ray) of a statistically complete sample known as the PG quasar sample. The second investigation focuses in detail on two sources that are representatives of the rare class of ""changing look"" AGN, and for which we have recently amassed a very considerable amount of high-resolution radio imaging. Through both high-cadence time-domain investigations, highly coordinated multiwavelength observations, and multi-resolution radio observations, this project will lead to a better understanding of how the central engine functions in active galaxies. Identifying the processes contributing to the observed radio emission under different physical conditions and locations in AGN parameter-space will help us constrain models about AGN accretion, coronal emission, wind launching mechanisms and jet formation, all of which are major open questions.

Hidden in Plain Sight: A Panchromatic View Onto Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Extreme Emission Line Galaxies,"Black holes are mysterious and fascinating objects where the gravity is so strong that not even light can escape them. Supermassive black holes are a million to a billion times the mass of our Sun and are ubiquitous at the centers of massive galaxies. Supermassive Black Holes play a critical role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe and the galaxies around them, as they influence the formation of stars and the distribution of matter through their powerful gravitational pull and energy output. This research team will help explain long-standing questions of black hole formation. Intermediate-mass Black Holes (IMBHs; 100 to 100,000 times the mass of our Sun), are one of the best theories for what seeded the first supermassive BHs, and they are expected to still reside in the smallest-scale galaxies today. A new class of low-mass galaxies has been discovered that might be powered by IMBHs. These so-called ""Extreme Emission Line Galaxies"" (EELGs) emit inexplicably large amounts of very high-energy light that are well beyond what stars can produce. This research also provides an exciting and natural way to bring diverse astronomers together and prepare students for graduate study. The investigator will develop a BH Summer Bridge Course, provide Postdoc Mentoring opportunities tailored to BH research and establish long-lasting affinity support groups through Writing Retreats and a Beyond Astronomy Conference. This project will address the outstanding challenges that have so far obscured a clear view of IMBHs using a novel, multi-pronged pathway for studying IMBH signatures in EELGs. The investigator will (1) use spectral energy distribution (SED)+line fitting to diagnose the relative contribution of IMBHs to the high-energy ionizing continuum; (2) measure BH masses from photoionization models that incorporate broad (~1000 km/s) Balmer emission lines; and (3) inform the growth history of SMBHs. This primary objectives are (i) learning more about the conditions in which IMBHs thrive and in which they fail to exist and (ii) constraining the source of hard ionizing radiation in EELGs.

Surveying the Broad-Line Region Landscape of XRISM AGNs,"Supermassive black holes are some of the most extreme objects in the universe, and it appears that every massive galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole in its center. These black holes appear to shape the growth and evolution of the galaxies in which they live. The investigators will focus on supermassive black holes that are vigorously “eating”. They will map the flows of gas into and out of the centers of these galaxies to answer several key questions about how black holes eat, and how this process in turn affects the host galaxy. The large data sets that will be collected to answer these questions will provide numerous opportunities to train students at the undergraduate and graduate level at Georgia State University, a Predominantly Black Institution with one of the most diverse student bodies in the country. The PI will pilot an initiative to increase the flow of physics majors from the Perimeter College 2-year system to Georgia State University where they may complete a B.S. in physics. The PI will also continue cultivating connections that enable public outreach opportunities to foster science literacy and appreciation in the Atlanta area and beyond. Reverberation mapping is a powerful time-domain technique that tracks light echoes in the photoionized gas around an accreting supermassive black hole, mapping out the distribution and motions of the gas using time resolution rather than spatial resolution. This program seeks to leverage advances in reverberation mapping data quality and modeling capabilities, while capitalizing on the recent launch of the X-ray telescope XRISM and its order of magnitude improvement in spectral resolution, to constrain the geometry and kinematics of gas over 4 orders of magnitude in physical scale in the nuclei of a sample of accreting black holes spanning a range of masses and luminosities. Together, these complementary observational programs will provide a momentary snapshot of the gas flows involved in feeding and feedback between 10 to 10,000 gravitational radii and will enable the investigators to discern the geometry of the accretion and ejection flows across a range of physical scales, explore the potential ejection mechanisms at play, and constrain the accretion and ejection rates near the event horizons of these supermassive black holes. The PIs will also measure the mass of each black hole from the reverberation signals and the spin of each black hole from the X-ray spectroscopy.

Deep Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of Distant Galaxies with Photonic OH Suppression Filters,"While our atmosphere is transparent to visible and radio wavelengths, it is difficult to observe the near-infrared (NIR) from the ground, due to the extreme brightness and variability of the night sky at these wavelengths. The atmospheric emission in the NIR arises almost entirely from a forest of extremely bright, very narrow emission lines from OH molecules that vary on timescales of minutes. This team has recently demonstrated a technique to filter out these emission lines using technology borrowed from photonics. This project will use this photonic OH suppression filter in combination with the RIMAS instrument on the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). The research team will use this new instrument to follow up extremely luminous but transient explosions of massive stars (gamma-ray bursts or GRBs). They will train graduate and undergraduate astronomy students in instrumentation and broad scientific practices at the interface of photonics and astronomy. Some of the undergraduate students will be from neighboring minority-serving institutions as part of Maryland's GRAD-MAP initiative. The Maryland OH Suppression Infrared System (MOHSIS) has the potential to change the way NIR spectroscopy is done from the ground. The unique approach of MOHSIS relies on using fiber Bragg gratings, fabricated by imposing about 100,000 tiny (relative amplitude of 0.0001) variations of the refractive index along individual optical fibers. MOHSIS will be more powerful than the team’s first-generation instrument, called PRAXIS, for several reasons: (1) MOHSIS will remove the 200 strongest OH sky lines at 1.1 - 1.7 microns, covering the critically important J band between the visible and H-band spectroscopic observations. (2) MOHSIS will have lower background noise. (3) LDT will deliver image quality at least twice as good as the host telescope of PRAXIS. Moreover, LDT is ideally suited for GRB follow-ups as it allows for a fast (about 1 min) switch of instruments and simultaneous optical and NIR observations. The low-resolution spectra of optically dark GRBs will be combined with simultaneous optical photometry to derive dust extinction and accurate redshifts based on the position of the Ly-alpha break. Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM), which is specifically designed to find distant GRBs out to the era of the first generation of stars, will provide high-redshift GRB candidates starting 2024-25.

Discovery of Compounds containing Frustrated Vanadium Nets with Emergent Electronic Phenomena,"Non-technical abstract: The emergence of new, complex quantum materials is critical for continued developments in quantum information, sensing, and computing. Recent discoveries of ternary compounds with frustrated vanadium sublattices, meaning magnetic spins cannot arrange in alternating directions (think putting the spins on the corners of a triangle), have revealed multiple exotic phenomena, including superconductivity, residing within a single material. Even more intriguingly, these phenomena are found to interact and compete. Understanding the implications of these interactions is challenging because only a few material examples are known. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Toberer and his research group employ strategies to discover new crystalline compounds that contain layers of magnetic vanadium atoms. First, active search algorithms are utilized to efficiently explore ternary vanadium chemical spaces through a combination of (i) first principles calculations of known and hypothetical compounds and (ii) bulk synthesis and structure determination. Second, the fundamental properties of new vanadium ternary compounds are determined through low temperature measurements and quantum mechanical calculations. Third, single crystals are grown of the most promising compounds for further low temperature measurements. Together, these tasks are expected to enable the next generation of quantum materials. Interwoven throughout these efforts are educational opportunities for undergraduate students and scientific engagement with the broader public. These include summer research opportunities, public lectures on the intersection of solid-state chemistry with mineralogy and gemology, and a week-long summer camp on solid-state chemistry for students from rural areas of Colorado. Technical abstract With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Toberer and his research group seek to uncover new classes of vanadium polar intermetallics compounds where electronic correlations and topological band structures intersect on magnetically frustrated lattices. The inspiration for this research comes from recent discoveries within the KV3Sb5 and REV6Sn6 material classes; these compounds contain vanadium kagome sublattices that give rise to nontrivial topology, charge density waves, and superconductivity. The research begins with experimentally establishing ternary A-V-Z phase diagrams and associated novel compounds therein using bulk solid state chemistry approaches; these efforts leverage guidance from first principles calculations and physics-informed Bayesian optimization. For each new compound, the electronic structure and topology of each new compound is predicted using first principles methods for down-selection for single crystal growth using fluxes. Low temperature characterization of these single crystals reveals potential electronic instabilities arising from magnetic frustration; further characterization is facilitated through a commitment to sample sharing with the broader condensed matter community. The discovery and study of new quantum materials based on frustrated vanadium nets will ultimately enhance our understanding of the interaction between topology, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Interwoven throughout these activities are efforts to (i) build a new generation of STEM talent at the intersection of solid-state materials chemistry, condensed matter physics, and statistical decision making, (ii) broaden participation in STEM via targeted outreach, and (iii) engage the broader public in solid-state chemistry.

Realizing High Temperature Exciton Condensates at Molecule/2D van der Waals Interfaces,"Nontechnical description: Because two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals layered materials with different properties can be assembled on the nanoscale, they have been used to realize many electronic phases that are not available in traditional materials. In this project, the research team combines organic molecules with 2D layered crystals to realize high temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of excitons. The BEC is a macroscopic quantum state that has many interesting properties such as frictionless transport. The macroscopic nature of the BEC makes it suitable for quantum information science applications. Currently, because BECs typically exist only in ultracold (< 1 K) atomic gases, the applications for BECs are limited. The project aims to produce BECs in solid-state semiconductors at a much higher temperature (> 100 K) so that its novel properties would be utilized in more conventional electronic devices. The project trains undergraduate and graduate students in nanoscale material design, fabrication, and characterization in a collaborative environment. Emphasis is placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Outreach activities to the public include a summer camp for K-12 students and outreach seminars. Technical description: Compared to 2D/2D heterostructures, the molecular lattice in molecule/2D heterostructures can provide added tunability to the electronic structure. The team utilizes functionalities of molecules to build periodic trapping potentials for interlayer excitons with a period as small as 1 – 2 nanometers. Using this approach, we aim to increase the density of excitons by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude as compared to the maximum exciton density achievable in 2D/2D heterostructures. A high density of trapped excitons can enable us to realize the BEC phase at higher temperatures (> 100 K). Moreover, steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy and microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and time-correlated photon counting techniques will be used to characterize and understand BEC’s optical and transport properties. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the coherent photon emission and the dissipationless transport of the BEC at high temperatures.

CAREER: Towards an Accessible Radio Astronomy Observatory in Rural Midwest,"Radio arrays are often built in remote locations and co-located with other highly sensitive instruments. Developing technologies to support these arrays can be expensive and difficult to coordinate with the observatories. The need for hands-on experience is seen in fields aiming to achieve extremely high dynamic range such as 21cm cosmology, where progress is limited by systematic effects. Understanding the subtle instrumental effects and finding ways to cope with them – through innovative hardware or software improvements – is needed to unlock the potential of low frequency radio astronomy. This project will build local expertise and capabilities at a predominantly undergraduate institution to support an accessible radio astronomy observatory in the rural Midwest. Three student researchers will be hired each year. In addition to enhancing their astronomy education, the students will gain a wide array of transferable skills including high performance computing, electronic design, RF testing, system engineering, data analysis, statistics, and algorithmic development. The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) Swarm is a novel concept to build several radio interferometers across the continent. Each station will operate independently with capabilities to study stellar bursts, pulsars, and the ionosphere. But the real capability of the Swarm is enabled when the stations operate together as a long baseline interferometer. The resulting instrument will have sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies below the FM band, opening opportunities to study magnetic fields of extra-solar planets and resolve the scattering disks of pulsars. Over the course of five years, this project will establish the Midwest Minnesota site for the observatory and perform a variety of demonstrations and experiments that will enhance future proposals to build a larger scale facility. The observatory will provide opportunities for U.S. based researchers to perform ad hoc instrumentation experiments as well as host a station for a continental scale interferometer. Furthermore, the location will add significant value to the point spread function of the LWA Swarm by providing a much-needed North-South baseline and improving sky coverage at high latitudes to open the possibility of continuous observing of the north celestial pole. A low-barrier testbed site will enable fast development of technologies to progress larger experiments in high-priority science fields, while giving low-cost hands-on field experience to students, particularly undergraduates where research experiences have significant impact on retention and views toward STEM careers.

Particle Astrophysics with The Super-Kamiokande Detector,"Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a world leading particle physics experiment studying neutrinos, which are subatomic particles that are produced naturally (e.g. in stellar cores and cosmic ray interactions with the earth atmosphere) as well as artificially (e.g. in nuclear reactors and dedicated neutrino beams using particle accelerators). This project focuses on neutrinos from non-accelerator sources, in particular solar neutrinos, neutrinos from supernova explosions, other possible sources of cosmic neutrino neutrinos, and reactor neutrinos. The research impacts particle physics as well as astrophysics. The research will involve and be used in the education and training of graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students. It is also of interest to a next-generation neutrino detector called Hyper-Kamiokande which is currently under construction in Japan. The research uses new methods of identifying neutrino interactions from unfiltered detector data such as machine learning and high data volume processing thereby training students in this important emerging field of computer science. A previous NSF grant supported the design, construction, and installation of a new trigger system, the Wideband Intelligent Trigger (WIT) in the Super-Kamiokande detector as well as analysis of its data. WIT completely processes all off the data in the un-triggered, raw stream and extracts electrons with high efficiency down to 2.49 MeV, the limit of stable and reliable event reconstruction at Super-Kamiokande: the group searches and reconstructs potential candidates in each data block independently to reduce background, processing time and final data size to a manageable level. Using WIT, UCI has identified solar neutrino interactions at lower energies than before in SK (below 3.49 MeV). Such neutrinos are less susceptible to the “MSW effect” than higher energy solar neutrinos. UCI is studying the validity and details (such as energy dependence) of the MSW effect. SK has now been upgraded by dissolving Gd2(SO4)3, to enhance its neutrino detection capabilities. Previously, neutrons in SK were observed by the 2.2 MeV gamma emitted from capture on Hydrogen after about 200 micro-seconds. On average there were only seven detected photons, and the detection efficiency was quite low. Now, after the upgrade, about 50% of the neutrinos will capture on Gd which makes an 8 MeV gamma cascade and produces about 22 detected photons per capture after about 35 micro-seconds. UCI created a data sample below 100 MeV with the most sensitivity to search for neutrinos coincident with supernovae in nearby galaxies, gravitation wave detections, gamma ray bursts, and high-energy neutrinos. We expect large improvements in the sensitivity of such searches from our current program to further reduce the background from cosmic ray muon-induced spallation. This data sample also searches for the “diffuse sea” of neutrinos emitted by all supernovae up to a red shift of about 1. The improved neutron detection efficiency improves the separation from supernova anti-neutrino interactions from background. The award is aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-messenger Astrophysics as it coordinates the use of multi-messengers observations utilizing cosmic neutrinos and providing alerts to the larger community.

ECLIPSE: Ultrafast photoemission induced non-equilibrium plasmas,"This award supports a study of time-dependent formation and evolution of a plasma generated using photoemission driven by ultrafast lasers. Plasmas are often created through electrical breakdown of neutral gas to generate charged particles, but it is also possible to create a plasma by shining a laser on a metal surface causing electrons to be ejected by a process called photoemission. Recent developments in ultrafast nano-optics have made it possible to create plasmas using photoemission that have specific properties in the spatial and velocity-distribution of the resulting electron population. A better understanding of the fundamental physics of this process will be transformative for both basic scientific research and emerging applications, such as plasma based high speed electronics and microchips, plasma catalysis and processing, and robust ultrafast laser detectors. The project will theoretically and numerically study how the plasma electrons evolve from a given anisotropic velocity distribution due to photoemission to a thermalized state. Plasmas with precise seeding offer a widely accessible laboratory platform to study fundamental plasma physics, such as the evolution of plasma waves and instabilities. In addition, by tailoring the photoemission pulse properties and repetition rate, the research explores a possible new way of direct normal glow plasma generation using photoemission, by skipping Paschen’s breakdown, which will help to eliminate circuit stress, reduce plasma contamination, and improve system reliability. Plasma generation and control using cheap, low intensity light sources will also be explored, with the help of plasmonic resonant enhanced photoemission. Furthermore, this research may enable a new paradigm of few-cycle laser characterization for carrier-envelope phase (CEP) sensitivity with significantly enhanced signal strength using plasmas. Sub-optical-cycle control of plasmas is also important to potentially transformative applications, such as precise electrification of chemical reactions, chip-scale plasma accelerators, ultrahigh speed plasma electronics, and ambient-condition testbeds for strong-field nano-optics.

LHCb Operations and Computing,"The development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a major intellectual achievement. The validity of this model was further confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model leaves open many questions, including why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of quarks and leptons, and the properties of dark matter, among others. Most explanations require new phenomena, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM), and which the LHCb experiment at CERN has been designed to explore. This award provides facility operations, maintenance, and computing support to enable the participation of U.S. scientists in the LHCb experiment at CERN. The LHC is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions. The LHCb experiment is one of four large experiments at the LHC and is designed to study in detail the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks. The goal is to identify the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. The new physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of hadrons containing the b and c quarks, allowing new phenomena to be observed indirectly. U.S. groups play a leading role in the physics analysis, hardware development, and computing of LHCb. This award will support the NSF-supported groups' share of common items necessary for the experiment, maintenance and operations support for U.S.-delivered components, co-location of an LHCb Tier-2 computing facility, and R&D to optimize the operation of the experiment. The broader impacts of this award cover many areas, from student research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students, to very active QuarkNet Centers and Masterclass programs for high school teachers and students. A steady stream of undergraduates has been working in the participating university laboratories, where graduate students also have direct engagement in both instrumentation development as well as data analysis. Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the fabrication, testing, and maintenance of detector components under U.S. responsibility.

CDS&E: Moment Approach to Multiscale Plasmas,"Plasma, one of four fundamental states of matter, can be found everywhere in the cosmos, from the laboratory to the solar atmosphere, to supernova remnants and distant galaxies. This award supports a computational study of how energy in plasmas is distributed and dissipated in systems where collisions between charged plasma particles are infrequent. The project will develop reduced models that leverage novel machine learning techniques to make simulations more efficient, and will integrate them into an open-source simulation code applicable to problems in astrophysics, space weather modeling, and fusion energy development. This multidisciplinary project straddling the fields of plasma physics, computational physics, and machine learning will offer a valuable experience to undergraduate and graduate students. Project's outreach activities will involve presentations at universities and local high schools in coordination with the Wonders of Physics program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The primary methodology used by this project will be based on the recently developed moment-hierarchy model for magnetized plasmas at arbitrary collisionality. The model will be integrated into an open-source, machine-learning-ready simulation code that incorporates both traditional neural networks and more advanced physics-informed neural networks. The methodology will enable a transition from simplified models with ad-hoc closures and reduced collision operators to a first-principles framework. This approach will alleviate the computationally intensive nature of micro-scale kinetic simulations and enhance the ability to simulate and understand weakly collisional astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. The work will be performed in collaboration with École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, the University of California, Los Angeles, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Princeton University. The numerical results will be validated using experimental facilities at the Wisconsin Plasma Physics Laboratory (WiPPL).

Engineered Global Gates for Advanced Simulations of Quantum Materials and Chemistry,"A long-standing challenge of quantum information processing has been to predict the observable properties of complex physical systems found in nature. For instance, in state-of-the-art materials and chemical design, many behaviors may be fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics and too difficult to calculate classically. For the past 15 years, quantum technologies have pushed forward on this frontier to encode systems of interest into quantum bits, which may then be programmed to emulate the desired system properties. However, most of the work to date has been limited to studying constrained classes of quantum materials or has been limited by the large number of required gates and demanding technical overhead of universal quantum computing approaches. Here, this project combines enhanced analog quantum emulation capabilities with interspersed single-qubit gates to greatly expand the types of physical systems which may be studied, while avoiding the steep experimental resources required for full quantum computation. In addition, this project serves as a rich training environment for experimental graduate students and theory collaborators in this area of national priority. Using a customized trapped-ion quantum apparatus, this research probes disordered and topological systems in two dimensions, geometric versus long-ranged frustration in synthetic quantum materials, and the molecular dynamics and wavepacket evolution of hydrogen-bonded systems in quantum chemistry. These studies are each enabled by engineering the frequency spectrum of globally addressed laser beams used to generate entanglement between trapped ion qubits. Using this technique, there is a plethora of new interaction graphs required for materials and quantum chemistry studies (such as pure nearest-neighbor interactions, ring topologies, infinite-range couplings, and higher-dimensionality spin lattices), that all become accessible to trapped-ion quantum emulation devices. It is anticipated that the engineered global gate protocols developed by the team, which are not available on general purpose cloud-based quantum computing platforms, will allow for higher-fidelity emulations of complex physical systems when compared with more generic gate-model approaches.

Illuminating the Interplay of Multiphase Galactic Winds and the CGM: Insights into the Processes that Regulate Galaxy Evolution and Shape Observations,"This project will help us understand how galaxies, like our Milky Way, grow and change over time. Galaxies are filled with gas that forms stars and fuels black holes. When stars explode as supernovae, they send out large amounts of energy and material into space, creating galactic winds that can shape how galaxies develop. These winds are important because they can stop galaxies from becoming too massive and full of gas. However, there is a big difference between what leading computer models predict about these winds and what we actually observe. The investigator will use advanced computer simulations to study how these winds interact with the gas that surrounds galaxies, known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). By combining these simulations with real observations, the project will give us new insights into how galaxies evolve. This work will involve students, helping train the next generation of scientists and improving our understanding of the universe. The investigator team will address the glaring discrepancy between current cosmological galaxy formation models and observations of galactic wind outflow rates by focusing on the interaction between galactic winds and the CGM. Using the state-of-the-art adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) magnetohydrodynamics code framework, athena++, the investigators will conduct high-resolution simulations that capture the self-consistent launching and dynamics of these galactic winds and their interactions with the CGM. These simulations will include key physical processes such as magnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays, UV shielding, thermal conduction, and non-equilibrium ionization, assessing their individual and collective impact. Crucially, the use of AMR in these simulations will enable unparalleled spatial fidelity, from the interiors of galaxies to the expansive CGM. A robust forward modeling pipeline will be developed to produce multi-wavelength mock observations, enabling direct comparisons with observational data from instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Multi-Scale Magnonic Crystals and Fractional Schr?dinger Equation-Governed Dynamics,"Nontechnical Abstract: This project focuses on the design of advanced materials utilizing the geometries of nature. Nature, unlike geometry class in high school, is not composed of smooth lines, planes, and spheres, but rather bumpy, wrinkled, jagged curves like DNA wrapped up in the cell, surfaces like a mountainous landscape, and volumes like the porous nature of soil in the water table. Fractional derivatives have been used to describe these geometries of nature, but no one has built such geometries from the ground up, element by element. Using textured thin magnetic films, the team will build such geometries as the basis for a new class of materials intermediate between order and disorder. These materials will control transport of information in the form of waves of magnetism, called spin waves, moving through our textured thin film slower (sub-diffusive) or faster (super-diffusive) than possible in simple geometries used up till now. Construction of this new artificial material will be the first experimental realization of a quantum fractional derivative, because spin waves follow the same equations as the wave physics of quantum mechanics, in this case the fractional Schrödinger equation, up till now a purely theoretical idea. A key facet of this work is cross-training of graduate students between theory and experiment, producing a more robust workforce that can work in multiple modalities to solve new problems not tractable otherwise. Fields in which the work force can excel with this knowledge include battery technology, based on porous, fractional materials; the spread of contaminants in soil and the water table; and vascular structures for transport in biological matter, including self-healing materials based on biological ideas. Technical Abstract: Fractional derivatives describe the bumpy, wrinkled, and jagged geometries of nature, where an integer derivative leads to divergent results rendering traditional definition of a derivative inapplicable, due to a rapid increase in the tangent and curvature with decreasing “ruler size”. Such natural geometries in the quantum context have been theoretically described with the fractional Schrӧdinger equation but never experimentally studied. The team will explore the fractional Schrӧdinger equation-governed fundamental physics in multi-scale materials that consist of magnetic thin film–based, spatially modulated magnonic crystals. They will design and measure tunable sub-diffusive and super-diffusive transport in this artificial lattice as clear evidence of fractional Schrӧdinger equation dynamics. The design builds on a new order-disorder lattice modulation axis, with an ordered lattice at one extreme and a disordered lattice giving rise to Anderson localization at the other. The project will provide a general basis for generating fractional partial differential equations, and lead to a deeper understanding of the present highly empirical approach to porous and other fractional media ranging from battery applications to biomimetic Murray materials to spread of contaminants in soil and the water table. The program will be carried out through tight, integral collaborations between Mingzhong Wu's experimental group at Colorado State University and Lincoln Carr's theoretical group at Colorado School of Mines. Working together as an integrated team encompassing experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics, they propose a multi-faceted approach to meet broader impact goals, centrally themed on blending experiment and theory to train our graduate and undergraduate student to become well-rounded scientists. This DMR grant supports research on fundamental understanding of quantum materials and especially exploring principles that cross-cuts many other condensed matter systems with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.

Development of a Sub-Kelvin Testbed for Characterization of On-Chip Far-Infrared Integrated Spectrometers,"The dust and gas between stars emits light with wavelengths much longer than we can see with our eyes. This light, called far-infrared (FIR) light, can teach us about the material in our galaxy when we divide the light into channels that correspond to the wavelengths where different molecules radiate. In this way, we can learn about how stars form, evolve, and die. The devices used to split FIR light into these channels, called spectrometers, are complicated and expensive. The next generation of telescopes will need smaller and less costly technologies to reach their science goals. This project could lead to a new type of spectrometer that could reduce their size and expense by a factor of 100 or more. In this program, the investigator will build and use a system to test prototype spectrometers, a crucial step in developing this technology. This investigation will also help train students, providing important opportunities for them to work hands-on with cutting-edge technology in the new field of Quantum Information Science. FIR observations probe both objects and processes that are often invisible at other wavelengths, as well as a rich set of atomic and molecular transition lines that are diagnostic of heating and cooling processes in interstellar material. Unfortunately, standard FIR spectral dispersion technologies are challenging and expensive to implement, particularly in the context of the large-format spectrophotometers that will be deployed on the next generation of telescopes. Recent advances in semiconductor fabrication offer the potential for new, integrated on-chip devices that use quasi-photonic methods to disperse and sense the light. This kind of technology offers large scalability, ease of manufacture, size, and performance advantages that would enable the instruments required to meet the demands of astrophysics over the next two decades. The investigator is involved in a multi-institution collaboration developing next-generation quasi-photonic FIR on-chip spectrometer technology, but a sub-Kelvin testbed to perform device characterization of these novel spectrometers is necessary to make progress. In this ATI program the testbed will be designed, fabricated, commissioned, and used to characterize prototype on-chip spectrometer devices. This award also supports a new institutional capability for students and faculty to perform sub-Kelvin cryogenic testing of photonic and quantum information technologies. These include augmenting the hands-on training in RIT's new Quantum Information Science and Technology degree track and providing a new experimental capability for students in RIT's nascent PhD in Physics program.

Collaborative Research: A Precise and Accurate Determination of the Hubble Constant Through Stellar Kinematics of Lens Galaxies,"The “Hubble Tension” is the statistically significant difference between direct determinations of the Hubble constant H0 in the local Universe and the value extrapolated from early universe measurements under the standard flat lambda cold dark matter model (Lambda-CDM). The team has previously published a measurement of H0 based on seven gravitational time delay lenses that reached 2% precision and was in excellent agreement with the local distance ladder method based on Cepheids and in strong tension with early universe data. However, these results depend on specific assumptions about the mass density profile of lens galaxies - the key source of systematic uncertainty in this method. A research collaboration between the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of California-Davis (UCD) will improve this important measurement by adding precision and using new observations to resolve some of the ambiguities in the physical models. The investigators will continue their educational/public outreach efforts, focused on increasing the number of young scientists from underrepresented groups and highlighting the importance and a real understanding of the scientific method. To address these issues, the team proposes to extend this work to a sample of 12 time delay gravitational lenses and obtain spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the deflectors. In addition, they plan to combine information from time delay lenses with that obtained from two samples of non-time delay lenses (SLACS and SL2S). The two external samples, SLACS and SL2S, provide additional statistical information about the dynamics and mass distributions of the population of lensing galaxies. The use of multiple strategies, multiple instruments, multiple samples and multiple modeling codes will allow the team to check for residual systematics and selection effects. Finally, they will use samples of elliptical galaxies that are not lenses to extract information about their mass distribution on a statistical basis and further improve the sample. At UCLA, the lead investigator will teach a new course “Energy in nature and society”, aimed at illustrating to students the scientific method and improving the use of quantitative thinking into the environmental debate, and develop an astrophysics curriculum for preschool. Similarly, the lead investigator at UCD has developed a month-long “Introduction to Astrophysics” course for high-school students on the Davis campus as part of the UC COSMOS program. This course introduces high school students, drawn from California’s diverse population, and many from small schools in isolated areas, to a research environment in which they work with data from cutting-edge facilities.

GLOW: Constraining the Atmospheric Signatures of Magmatic Volcanism on Terrestrial Exoplanets,"Rocky planets orbiting stars other than the Sun (exoplanets) are common, and cutting-edge space- and ground-based telescopes are now observing their atmospheres through their spectroscopic features. By analogy to Earth, the atmospheres of these planets are expected to be shaped by release of gases from their hot interiors, termed “outgassing”. Drawing connections between studies of Earth and studies of exoplanets, researchers at the University of Arizona will model the geochemistry and observational signposts of magmatic outgassing on temperate, Earth-like exoplanets. They will integrate this exoplanet research with a science enrichment program conducted at Flandrau Planetarium, targeting grades 3-6 from the diverse Tucson school system, reaching thousands of students. Atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets are now becoming observable, and the first hints of atmospheric detections have begun to emerge. Some of these exoplanets are predicted to have enhanced magmatic outgassing of volatile species due to strong tidal heating, which might detectably modify their atmospheres. This is significant because magmatic volcanism is invoked as both a habitability indicator and as a potential source of abiotic false positives for biosignature gases. The investigators will produce theoretical models of exoplanet volcanism, accounting for magmatic outgassing of volatiles, their atmospheric photochemical processing, and radiative transfer simulations of the resultant planetary spectra. They will determine the best spectral signatures of magmatic outgassing and how those signatures may be used to determine the properties of the underlying planet. They will also develop a new Astronomy Discovery Program at Flandrau Science Center & Planetarium, consisting of hands-on inquiry-based activities. The goal is to enhance science literacy and recruitment to STEM and college and to broaden the demographical participation in science. The program will include exoplanet themes, leveraging the expertise of the researchers; it addresses state and national science standards, meeting community needs.

"Spatially, Temporally, and Spectrally Resolved Electrical Probing of Optical Excitations","Nontechnical description In semiconductors, a photon of sufficient energy can generate an electron-hole pair, which forms a bound excitonic state due to the attractive Coulomb force. The recombination of excitons is critical for light-emitting applications, whereas the dissociation of excitons into free carriers plays a key role for photovoltaics and photodetection. Combining the illumination in the optical regime and detection in the low-frequency microwave regime, the research team performs variable-temperature electrical probing of optically excited quasiparticles in a spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolved manner. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of low-frequency response of optical excitations and exotic quantum phases in moire superlattices. An integrated research and education program at University of Texas at Austin is established such that students at different levels are trained to master modern nanofabrication techniques, microwave engineering and laser optics, and scanning probe microscopy, which prepares them for future careers in science or engineering. Technical description The interaction between light and semiconductors is dominated by the generation, recombination, and dissociation of excitons. Traditionally, studies of bound excitons and mobile charges are performed in different spectral regimes, with either insufficient spatial or temporal resolution. In this project, the researchers conduct cryogenic laser illuminated microwave impedance microscopy experiments for the study of transport and diffusion of excitons and trions in two-dimensional monolayers and heterostructures, as well as local properties of exciton insulators and topological moire excitons, with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. As a result, the team can extract the effective permittivity of excitons in monolayer semiconductors, visualize the transport and diffusion of excitons and trions with high spatial resolution, evaluate the electrical properties of intralayer and interlayer excitons, and probe the correlation and topology of moire excitons. The work is important for optoelectronic applications of two-dimensional materials and heterostructures under intense illumination. The research is at the cutting edge of nano-optoelectronic materials systems and aligned with the mission of the NSF Electronic and Photonic Materials Program.

"Equipment: MRI: Track 1 Acquisition of a Hybrid, High-Performance Computing Cluster for Gravitational-Wave Data Analysis and Source Interpretation","It has been nearly a decade since the first direct measurement of a “ripple in spacetime” known as a gravitational wave. Since then, over 100 gravitational-wave candidates have been detected, all arising from the violent collisions of black holes and neutron stars millions to billions of light years away. These extreme events offer a new look into fundamental physics, from the nature of gravity to the properties of dense nuclear matter, as well as into the astrophysical properties of black holes and neutron stars. Extracting these insights, however, requires major computing resources, especially given the ever-increasing number of gravitational-wave detections. This award supports the purchase of a high-performance computing cluster at Northwestern University for use in analyzing and understanding gravitational waves. The cluster will enable discoveries from large catalogs of gravitational waves and provide a training ground for the next generation of gravitational-wave scientists. With this new computing cluster, the PI's team will develop libraries of simulations of gravitational-wave signals and use advanced statistical techniques to infer the individual and population properties of their sources. The cluster will also allow the group to advance simulations of complex systems of stars, which could be factories of sources of gravitational waves. By understanding how different astrophysical environments affect these sources' physical parameters and comparing them to gravitational-wave data, the PI and her team will answer fundamental questions about the origins of black holes and neutron stars.

Collaborative Research: Worm Algorithm and Diagrammatic Monte Carlo for Strongly Correlated Condensed Matter Systems,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical and computational studies of materials and systems in which their constituents (electrons, atoms, and ions) interact strongly with each other and, as a result, exhibit novel quantum behavior. The main research focus is on advancing fundamental understanding of unusual properties and phenomena which may lead to the development of future technologies. The PIs will employ advanced analytical methods and computational algorithms that they have developed to achieve accurate description of several key condensed matter systems at low temperature when collective quantum behavior of atoms and electrons results in the superconducting and superfluid states. Superconductivity and superfluidity are phenomena characterized by zero resistance and zero viscosity to the electron and fluid flows, respectively. These are related states of matter distinguished by the charge of the particles participating in the flow: in superconductors the flow is associated with charged electron pairs, while in superfluids it is due to the flow of neutral atoms such as, for example, Helium-4. In this project, various mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in prototypical systems and superfluidity in Helium-4 will be investigated. This project also supports training graduate students in advanced numerical techniques, quantum statistics, topical problems of condensed-matter and atomic physics, and high-performance computing. This project also helps to advance the Precision Many Body Physics Initiative which is aimed to facilitate international collaboration in cutting edge research directed toward understanding collective properties of matter, including quantum matter. Activities planned within this context include international workshops, Focused Sessions at American Physical Society March Meetings, and topical mini workshops. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical and computational research with an aim to achieve a fundamental understanding of electronic and transport properties of a variety of condensed matter systems through the use of two state-of-the-art approaches to correlated quantum many-body systems: Worm Algorithm (WA) and Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC); both introduced by the research team. The main goals of the project are: (i) WA-based studies of a new class of pseudo-one-dimensional superfluid systems called ""transverse quantum fluids""; (ii) DiagMC studies of Cooper instability in the prototypical model of correlated electrons, uniform electron gas (with and without coupling to the phonon subsystem); and (iii) DiagMC studies of novel polaron and bipolaron states.

NSF-BSF: Getting to the Core of Core Formation and Core Dynamics,"The central regions of galaxies are extremely diverse; while some galaxies have extremely dense 'cusps' of stars and dark matter, others have extended low-density cores. This suggests that there are multiple pathways to the formation of galactic nuclei. A team of experts from the US (NSF-funded) and Israel (BSF-funded) will undertake a comprehensive study of both core formation and core dynamics. They will make reliable estimates of the merger rate of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and for the off-centering fractions of SMBHs and nuclear star clusters in dwarf galaxies. Complementing this research program, this team will contribute to K-12 science education and outreach, addressing the critical need for students to engage in STEM-related disciplines. They will promote careers and interest in STEM through Yale’s Pathway to Science Summer Scholars program by developing and running summer programs in astronomy. While the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm predicts that dark matter halos have dense central cusps, some galaxies have central constant-density cores. The presence of such cores either hints at an alternative to CDM, such as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), or requires intriguing dynamical processes involving baryons or supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Cores are also intriguing because they manifest unexpected dynamics. In particular, simulations have shown that dynamical friction does not operate inside cores, causing ‘core-stalling’, and that massive objects within a core experience a ‘dynamical buoyancy’ that pushes them outward. These processes can prevent massive objects such as nuclear star clusters and/or SMBHs from reaching, or remaining, at the center of their potential well, which can have important implications. The investigators will (i) further develop the novel model CuspCore and test it against numerical simulations, opening up a new avenue to analytically model the response of multi-component, gravitational systems to a wide variety of perturbations without having to resort to CPU-intensive simulations, and (ii) establish the necessary conditions for core stalling and buoyancy to operate in both CDM and SIDM halos.

Collaborative Research: The SuperCDMS at SNOLAB Science Program,"The goal of the SuperCDMS Collaboration is to directly detect galactic dark matter and in so doing address the following questions: what is the particle nature of dark matter, what are its astrophysical properties, and how does it relate to the Standard Model? In pursuit of this goal, the Collaboration is nearing completion on the construction of a new experiment, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, sited in SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada. The advanced cryogenic detectors being used by the experiment have unprecedented sensitivity to nuclear recoil interactions from dark matter with mass in the 400 MeV/c^2 to 6 GeV/c^2 range (the mass range from approximately an individual proton to a few protons), as well as inelastic electronic interactions in the 1 MeV/c^2 to 1 GeV/c^2 range (the mass range approximately between an electron and a proton.). The SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment will have sensitivity to dark matter interactions down to a cross section where solar neutrino interactions with the detector become a limiting background (the so-called “neutrino fog”). The SuperCDMS collaboration, and the university groups supported by this award, will complete the installation of experiment during the first award year, and will subsequently transition to commissioning and data acquisition. As part of commissioning, it is our goal to establish stable, optimal detector operation and understand the detector response, including backgrounds. The tasks supported under this award will be scientific or involve those being scientifically trained. Those tasks are essential to producing timely results from the first run of the full payload. The work supported by this award will focus on: Completion and deployment of a robust, efficient, and fast data quality monitoring and data handling chain, providing personnel to support the installation and commissioning efforts of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment, and producing a comprehensive detector response model including a plan to fully calibrate the SuperCDMS SNOLAB detectors. Finally, the supported work will include analysis of science data taken in the CUTE facility with a HV detector tower to produce competitive dark matter searches, as well as analysis of Run 1 data from the full SuperCDMS SNOLAB payload.

Decoding the First Galaxies via 21-cm Fluctuations,"The first galaxies formed from pristine hydrogen gas within the first billion years of cosmic history, but our theories cannot fully explain how. A team of scientists from the University of Texas, Austin, will tackle the questions of how the first galaxies assembled their stellar mass in the first billion years, what was their cosmological context, and what were the drivers of cosmic reionization. The team will provide mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoc. In an effort to promote scientific discussion in Hispanic and Latinx communities, the PI will partner with the McDonald Observatory in West Texas and for the first time develop one of their educational DeepSkyTour videos entirely in Spanish. The next decade will see detailed observations of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, which will revolutionize our understanding of the first galaxies by probing their spatial distribution. This is key to breaking degeneracies in our theoretical models of the first cosmological structures. Extracting this information, however, requires careful and efficient modeling of the 21-cm signal beyond the spatial average. This project will provide this modeling through fast, flexible, and robust theoretical tools that will be made publicly available to the community through the Zeus21 software package. The team will implement stochastic galaxy formation on 21-cm models, study whether the reionization process was dominated by large or small bubbles, and develop new cosmological tests during reionization. This project will reveal the astrophysics sculpting the first cosmic structures, and in addition to scientific publications, talks, and public software releases, it will provide ultra-efficient 21-cm map-making techniques for both educational and scientific purposes.

Probing Solar Axions with X-ray Optics for BabyIAXO,"The nature of dark matter is a driving question of 21st century physics. Axions are among the best motivated candidates for dark matter, as they could solve underlying problems in our understanding of fundamental particle interactions, and other axion-like particles are a generic prediction of many new physics theories, in particular string theory. Axions would alter the processes taking place within the extreme environments of stellar interiors, such as within our own Sun. The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) will search for axions from our Sun, opening novel sensitivity to axions and axion-like particles across a broad range of masses. The goal of this proposal is to construct a focusing X-ray telescope and take leadership in analysis for BabyIAXO, the pathfinder to IAXO. This work will also expand instructor training in methods to promote “belonging” in undergraduate courses, in line with recommendations from the American Institute of Physics and the National Academies, as well as provide undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on expertise in instrumentation, facilitating broader applications of this X-ray telescope technology. The IAXO instrument is a next-generation axion helioscope, designed to search for axions from the Sun that are reconverted into X-ray photons via a strong laboratory magnetic field. BabyIAXO will advance technology for all IAXO subsystems at relevant scale while also offering novel physics reach and discovery potential. BabyIAXO and IAXO are the only experiments beyond the R&D phase sensitive to QCD axions in the meV to eV mass range, which is motivated by many dark matter scenarios, as well as a broad range of ALPs that could constitute all of dark matter. The goals of this proposal are to construct the inner core X-ray optic for BabyIAXO; lead implementation of the optics response into the simulation and analysis chain; and contribute to commissioning and initial analysis of BabyIAXO data. Cost-effective, large-area X-ray optics are key to reducing detector size and background while still exploiting large magnet areas, allowing a leap forward in axion helioscope sensitivity. This work will leverage the expertise and facilities from construction of the NuSTAR X-ray optics, on which the BabyIAXO and IAXO optics are based. Thus, a modest investment in student training and materials can establish the US as a leader of the IAXO X-ray optics system and the next generation of solar axion searches. The broader impacts of this work include (i.) educating a new generation of instrumentalists, helping ensure the US builds a globally competitive STEM workforce, (ii.) expanding the PI’s established collaborations with educational researchers on methods that foster “belonging” in undergraduate STEM classrooms, helping ensure that this workforce better reflects the diversity of the nation, and (iii.) enabling broader applications of segmented glass X-ray optics.

Characterizing Radio Continuum Emission from Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Leakers,"The reionization of the Universe is a cosmological event driven by young galaxies that resulted in the ionization of 99.99% of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by a redshift of ~6. Identifying the population of galaxies responsible for reionization has been very difficult, because ionizing flux from these galaxies is absorbed in the neutral IGM. The team will address this by studying galaxies at lower redshift that resemble those at z > 6 (Lyman Continuum Emitters, LCEs). The team will also create two 40-minute planetarium shows as part of the department’s outreach program. The shows will be hosted at the Marston Planetarium at Arizona State University. They will incorporate these shows into the K–12 field trip program that brings in 10,000 middle-school students from the Phoenix metropolitan region every year. The team obtained 221 hours of VLA observations to perform the first radio continuum (RC) study of a statistical sample of 80 confirmed LCEs with well-measured escape fractions. RC is a powerful dust-independent tracer generated by thermal (free-free) and non-thermal (synchrotron) processes. However, it depends on the number of free electrons and the magnetic field. Therefore, RC complements UV or optical traces and adds a new dimension for testing feedback models. The new RC data, when combined with ancillary data from other wavelengths, will yield constraints on theoretical models and physical conditions, e.g., age of the stellar population, radiation pressure-driven feedback, stellar winds, supernova feedback, etc., that results in the leakage of ionizing flux from these systems.

Time-resolved XUV and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Gas-phase Molecules,"With support from the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Experimental Physics Program in the Division of Physics, and co-funding from Office of Strategic Initiatives in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Daniel Rolles of Kansas State University intends to perform photoelectron spectroscopy of gas-phase molecules. The advent of high-repetition-rate light sources from the extreme ultraviolet to the X-ray regime is a game-changing opportunity for the fields of ultrafast atomic and molecular physics, and gas-phase photochemistry, since they enable experimental studies to be performed in a time-resolved manner with femtosecond resolution. The results will have a profound impact on our understanding of chemical reaction mechanisms and of the control of chemical reaction dynamics. Being able to record “molecular movies” of benchmark photochemical reactions will allow for a more direct comparison to quantum chemistry calculations and therefore not only result in a better understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism, but ultimately also help to develop and optimize schemes for controlling the dynamics and outcomes of such reactions. Students and post-doctoral researchers will greatly benefit from participating in the project. They will become familiar with many tools and techniques of ultrafast laser science while experiencing a wide variety of research environments ranging from a state-of-the-art laser laboratory at a university to large-scale user facilities such as free-electron lasers and synchrotron light sources. These opportunities will prepare them for their future career either in academic or high-tech industrial research. The research of this project also has significant technological implications with potential benefits to society, e.g., through the development of novel materials for light harvesting or through a better understanding and control of the environmental impact of certain chemicals in the atmosphere. This project focuses specifically on imaging nuclear and electronic dynamics during photochemical reactions by means of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with X-ray free-electron lasers and high-order harmonic generation sources. The aim of these experiments is to study exemplary reactions in gas-phase molecules with the goal of clarifying their reaction mechanisms and pathways. Light-induced reactions in gas-phase molecules play a major role, e.g., in atmospheric chemistry and can also serve as prototypes for (bio-) chemical processes occurring, for instance, during the biosynthesis of vitamin D and for organic molecular switches.

Measuring the Unresolved Binary Fraction in the Core of the Orion Nebula Cluster,"One of the great mysteries in modern astronomy is the process by which stars form. Stars can be much larger or smaller than the Sun, yet somehow all originate from the same clouds of gas and dust. In many cases, these forming stars will come in twin pairs called binary stars. It is uncertain how binary stars form, whether they are more likely to be close to each other or far apart, and if they are more likely to be ""fraternal or identical"". In this study, the researchers will search for new binary stars in the nearby Orion stellar nursery. They will look for binary stars that are closer to each other than Saturn is to the Sun. These close binary stars have been difficult to find in the past, and the researchers will use new techniques to discover them. The investigator seeks to motivate a wider group of students to pursue science research by creating a workshop on data science, based on their research efforts. The investigator would recruit students from underserved communities. The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is an ideal laboratory for this work, as it is the nearest site of massive star formation. Previous binary star surveys of the cluster have only been sensitive to separations > 10 Astronomical Units. These surveys have found a significant decrease in multiple systems at the widest separations, in contrast to stars in the field. Using the W.M. Keck observatory, the research group will target sources in the inner ONC with high resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with adaptive optics. This work will be enhanced by the use of a laser frequency comb for precision wavelength calibration, improving radial velocity uncertainties by a factor of 10. The group will determine the fraction of very close binaries (separation < 10 AU) for the first time in the central ONC, and compare the results to both measurements in other clusters and N-body simulations. Ultimately, this research will determine whether binary star properties are universal and which processes are dominant in shaping those properties.

Collaborative Research: Exploring Metastable Magnetic States in Unconventional Magnetic Domains of Two-dimensional van der Waals Magnets,"Nontechnical Abstract: Novel quantum materials with exotic electronic and magnetic properties offer a unique opportunity for developing future advanced computing technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as an ideal platform for exploring unique magnetic states and developing functional spintronic devices. Through a collaborative effort between the University of Wyoming and Colorado State University , this research delves into the unconventional magnetic properties of selected 2D vdW magnets. This interdisciplinary team employs both experimental and theoretical approaches, including nanofabrication, magnetotransport measurements, scanning tunneling microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, theoretical modeling, and first-principles calculations. These studies are expected not only to fill critical gaps in our scientific understanding but also to facilitate groundbreaking applications in spintronics-based computing. Furthermore, the project offers substantial research and educational opportunities for underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students, and female students in the fields of condensed matter physics, nanoscience, and nanotechnology. The accompanying graduate training program extends into high school outreach, collaborating with educators to integrate cutting-edge research into existing science curricula. Technical Abstract: Controllable magnetization dynamics offers a promising approach for achieving advanced computing using nanomagnetic devices, such as probabilistic bits (p-bits), voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy, and spin-logic devices in information and communication technology applications. In this collaborative project, the research team focuses on exploring the novel magnetic properties of few-layer two dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) magnets. The project has three primary objectives: 1) investigate the fundamental roles and behaviors of unconventional magnetic domains of the novel magnetic properties of few-layer 2D vdW magnets, 2) manipulate metastable magnetic phase transitions within these magnetic domains, and 3) uncover the mechanisms underlying magnetic switching in these materials. Various experimental and theoretical approaches are employed, including nanofabrication, magnetotransport, low-temperature magnetic force microscopy, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, theoretical modeling, and first-principle calculations. This research project expects to revolutionize the design and function of 2D vdW magnets, enabling the development of simple, energy-efficient, atomic-scale 2D vdW p-bits as fundamental components for the next generation of probabilistic computers. Additionally, the project's educational component provides invaluable opportunities for students and early-career researchers, equipping them with crucial knowledge and skills in advanced materials research and technology, thereby preparing them for significant contributions to the evolving field.

Investigating the physical origin of satellite planes,"During the past three decades, astronomers have developed a paradigm of galaxy formation explaining the origin of galaxies and larger structures of the cosmic web in which they are arranged. The main remaining puzzle that challenges this paradigm is the observations showing that dwarf satellites around the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies are spatially distributed in flattened, rotating “planes”. The main goal of the project is to figure out which of the two stark alternatives is true: observed satellite configurations and their orbits are a genuine challenge to the galaxy formation paradigm indicating new physics or their origin can be understood within its existing framework. As part of the project, a teaching model based on the simplified version of the galaxy formation model with a series of exercises and projects will be developed and made publicly available for educators to use. Additionally, simulations developed during the project will be used to produce high-fidelity, scientifically accurate visualizations of the evolution of our cosmic neighborhood for the Adler Planetarium and other planetariums. This project focuses on developing models and statistical frameworks for understanding the puzzling spatial and orbital configurations of dwarf satellite galaxies around the Milky Way and several nearby galaxies, which do not yet have a compelling physical explanation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of galaxy formation. The team will develop a series of simulations of volumes resembling the local cosmic neighborhood of the Milky Way. These will be used to forward-model observed satellite systems of nearby galaxies and statistical comparisons of model results with observations. This project will elucidate how galaxies in our local cosmic neighborhood form and how the local mass distribution affects galaxy formation. The results of this project should clarify whether observed satellite configurations present a major challenge to the CDM paradigm that would motivate looking for different cosmological models of structure formation involving non-standard physics.

Development of High-Field NV-detected NMR Spectroscopy for Nanoscale Chemical Sensing,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Susumu Takahashi and his group at the University of Southern California (USC) are devising novel means of improving the capability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – two important and widely used approaches to characterizing chemical systems. Their approach is based on quantum sensing, a physical measurement technique utilizing principles of quantum information science and technology. Specifically, the USC team is devising new approaches to quantum sensing-assisted NMR at high magnetic fields. Parallel educational efforts will focus on professional development to benefit graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school and elementary school students in USC’s neighborhood community, which has a high population of historically underrepresented minorities. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the investigation of structures and structural dynamics at the atomic and molecular levels. However, because of intrinsically low sensitivity, NMR often requires samples of relatively large volume. By exploiting the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, NMR sensitivity can be improved dramatically, down to the level of a single spin. NV-Detected NMR spectroscopy at high magnetic fields can provide significant advantages in investigations that benefit from fine spectral resolution, high signal sensitivity, and detection of nuclear spins with small gyromagnetic ratios. Under this award, the Takahashi group will use high-field NV-NMR to probe surface chemistry and nanoscale spin dynamics. If successful, this approach will provide a new way for analytical chemists to enhance sensitivity in NMR experiments, with potential broad long term scientific impacts on focused molecular experiments and on magnetic resonance imaging methods, as well.

BSM-PM: Understanding Gravity at the Smallest Scale,"Is there a way to reconcile gravity with quantum mechanics? It is well-known that quantum mechanics, the science of the very small, and gravitation do not integrate properly. Since the time of Newton, we have known that the force of gravity between two massive objects scales with the inverse of their distance squared. This law works well at planetary scales and for human scales. But we generally assume this ""inverse-square law"" to apply to much smaller distances, down to molecule scale, where quantum mechanics and gravity may work together. But, of course, this is a tremendous extrapolation that should be tested, at least in part, empirically. Indeed, many theories predict that gravity could deviate from the familiar inverse square law already at sub-millimeter distances. Such deviations are extremely difficult to measure experimentally due to the small strength of gravitation and the presence of residual electromagnetic interactions. This award funds the continuation of an experimental program in this area using an entirely novel technique. The team will train students in STEM research. The traditional technique to explore gravity at the meter to 0.1-millimeter scales relies on ever-improving versions of the classic Cavendish experiment, where the force of gravity is compared to the restoring force of a torsion fiber. More recent measurements have used devices obtained by photolithography but are still based on mechanical springs. This award supports an effort based on optical springs, taking advantage of the substantial progress in quantum optics and optomechanics in the last few decades. This is entirely new and holds the promise to revolutionize the field. Indeed, in addition to the primary goal, this new technique has already found applications in other fields of fundamental physics, and in technological areas as disparate as inertial guidance and vacuum measurement.

Gravitation Physics and Relativistic Astrophysics,"This award funds theoretical research on several different topics in relativistic astrophysics and general relativity. One focus is the exploration of newly discovered conservation laws involving black holes, and their implications for deep and poorly understood issues in quantum gravity such as the information loss paradox discovered by Stephen Hawking. A second focus is on tests of general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that have been detected by NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and that might be detected by future space-based detectors. Theoretical studies of sources of gravitational waves funded by this award will be useful to aid detection of signals from black holes and other sources, and also to aid in their interpretation. Gravitational wave studies can tell us about the nature of gravity, properties of black holes, and properties of the early Universe. The award supports the training of graduate students and postdocs in STEM research. In more detail, the principal research topics of this award are (i) the development of methods to compute the gravitational waveforms from point particles inspiralling into spinning black holes, using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches; (ii) demonstrating that the two body dynamics is Hamiltonian when the dissipation is removed; (iii) developing a comprehensive description and understanding of conservation laws involving soft hair on black holes, and (iv) investigating the consequences of these laws for the quantum evaporation of black holes and the ultimate fate of information that falls into black holes.

Thermophysical Properties of Ferromagnetic Materials,"NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT When heated, all materials change their volume, and the celebrated discovery of the low thermal expansion of Fe65Ni35 ""Invar"" led to a Nobel prize. Only recently has this Invar behavior become understood as a delicate competition between atom vibrations and magnetic spins in the material. This competition likely occurs in all magnetic materials. Besides competing, vibrations and spins can influence each other through ""spin-phonon interactions."" There is some evidence that spin-phonon interactions can improve the efficiency of magnetic refrigerators, which are not yet practical as household appliances. The ""magnetocaloric"" alloy La1Fe11.5Si1.5, with chemical substitutions for La and Fe, holds promise for practical refrigerators. Perhaps spin-phonon interactions in a variant of La1Fe11.5Si1.5 can couple the large heat capacity of atom vibrations to the change in magnetism with temperature. This research is an experimental study of how magnetism changes the thermal expansion of metals such as Fe-Pd, La1Fe11.5Si1.5, and perhaps EuO. Labs at Caltech are used to measure heat capacity, magnetization, and thermal expansion at temperatures from 2-400 K in applied magnetic fields. Three different types of X-ray scattering measurements at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL, provide a detailed understanding of vibrations and spins. The work is part of a Ph.D. thesis at Caltech. The graduate student and the principal investigator are mentoring a summer undergraduate research fellow, and mentoring high school students in a new summer program at Caltech to show them first-hand how scientific research is done. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Thermal expansion and magnetocaloric properties of ferromagnetic metals are studied with measurements of heat capacity and magnetization at temperatures from 2-400 K and magnetic fields up to 9 T. Materials of interest include Fe-Pd, chemical variants of La1Fe11.5Si1.5, and perhaps Tb-Dy and EuO. Measurements with nuclear resonant scattering of synchrotron radiation provide entropies from both atom vibrations and magnetism. The data are acquired with the samples under pressure in diamond anvil cells. Thermodynamic Maxwell relations convert the pressure dependences of vibrational and magnetic entropies to thermal expansion. For the overall thermal expansion, the vibrations and spins can work for or against each other. Less understood are interactions between spins and atomic vibrations. Some spin-phonon interactions in iron alloys are large enough to have measurable effects on thermophysical properties. Assessments of spin-phonon interactions use nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of phonon spectra as pressure drives the material through its Curie transition. The entropy of the Curie transition is obtained from heat capacity measurements and is used to determine magnetocaloric properties of interest for magnetic refrigeration. There is evidence that interactions between spins and phonons can pull some of the large phonon entropy into the magnetic transition, which could either enhance or diminish magnetocaloric efficiency. The work is research for a Ph.D. student at Caltech. A summer undergraduate research fellow is also mentored and supported. Through the ongoing Caltech Summer Research Connection, a new program, ""Thinking Like a Scientist,"" is being developed, where three high school students embedded in our research group learn how to formulate a hypothesis in applied physics or materials science and write a proposal to test it. In six weeks, they learn how materials scientists plan and do their work and develop confidence that they can do it, too.

Physical Properties Measurement Systems for Advanced Magnetic Materials,"We propose to install a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) as a shared facility that will serve a broad community of users working on functional magnetic materials and magnetoelectronic systems. Such a facility will enable state-of-the-art characterisation of the electric, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of materials in high magnetic fields, high pressure, and variable temperature from 1.4 to 1000 K.The research proposed by the PIs covers fundamental science (design and synthesis of quantum materials, understanding of charge-spin conversion processes, magnetoelectric couplings, disorder-optimized materials) as well as technological applications (spintronic devices, soft magnetic materials for electromagnets, high-temperature permanent magnets, construction steels).

Persistent Optical Phenomena in Oxide Semiconductors,"Nontechnical description: The project investigates two novel phenomena involving the interaction between light and matter. Persistent photoconductivity is a dramatic increase in a material’s ability to conduct electricity when exposed to light, which continues even after the light is turned off. Photochromism occurs when a material changes color upon light exposure. The research team aims to tie these important optical phenomena into a unified defect model. Advancing fundamental knowledge about persistent optical effects could benefit technologies ranging from rewritable electronics to smart windows. To accomplish these goals, they use state-of-the-art facilities to grow novel crystals and perform measurements to uncover their atomic-scale physical properties. Students involved in this research perform hands-on experiments, present results at scientific conferences, and meet with startup companies to discuss potential applications. Connected to the research project’s theme of defects in crystals, tutorials are developed for upper-division physics courses that provide a conceptual understanding of systems with many atoms and electrons. Technical description: The project investigates persistent photoconductivity and photochromism in oxide semiconductors and ties these important optical phenomena into a unified defect model. Advancing fundamental knowledge about persistent optical effects could benefit technologies ranging from rewritable electronics to smart windows. When a semiconductor is exposed to light, electrons from the valence band or defect levels can be promoted to the conduction band, increasing electrical conductivity. In the dark, the system generally relaxes to the ground state and conductivity returns to normal. Persistent photoconductivity (PPC) occurs when the conductivity remains even after the light source is turned off. Related to PPC, photochromism is a change in color upon exposure to light. The researchers are testing the hypothesis that PPC and photochromism in oxide semiconductors arise from the same effect: light liberates a hydrogen impurity from its substitutional site, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. Using unique facilities at Washington State University, crystals are grown with high purity and controlled defect populations. A variety of experimental methods, including Hall effect, infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence, are utilized to study the defects underlying PPC and photochromism. Additionally, the researchers are exploiting PPC to investigate transport over a wide range of free-electron concentrations.

"Controlling Electron, Magnon, and Phonon States in Quasi-2D Antiferromagnetic Semiconductors for Enabling Novel Device Functionalities","Non-technical Description This research addresses the properties of a new class of ultra-thin quasi-two-dimensional semiconductors with intrinsic magnetic properties. The exotic properties of this new class of semiconductors make them particularly interesting for fundamental science research and practical applications. The investigators will explore the electronic, magnetic, and thermal properties of these unique materials with thicknesses of a few-atomic layers only. The PIs will also investigate the potential of these materials for use in devices with novel functionality that operate at high speed with low-energy dissipation. This research aligns with the Nation’s need for the development and research of novel semiconductor materials and devices under the recent CHIPS and Science Act. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will facilitate the involvement of students in the proposed research and contribute to undergraduate and graduate STEM education. The project team has developed a detailed Broadening Participation Plan that will impact the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education of minorities underrepresented in STEM fields. Technical Description Transition-metal phospho-trichalcogenides span a wide variety of compounds with different electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties. These materials are one of a few van der Waals layered structures which can have intrinsic antiferromagnetism, even at mono-layer thickness. The band gap of these materials varies from ~1.3 eV to ~3.5 eV based on the type of its transition- metal element. Theory suggests that the application of gate bias and strain can induce phase transitions in these materials, changing their properties. While electrical insulators and conductors with AFM spin order have been studied extensively, little is known experimentally about antiferromagnetic layered semiconductors. This project aims to investigate the electron, phonon, and magnon properties of these unique materials at single- and few-layer structures, and to assess the possibilities of controlling their properties for enabling novel device functionalities. To achieve these goals, various types of these compounds will be synthesized and characterized using cryogenic micro – Brillouin – Raman spectroscopy, and electrical and thermal transport measurements. The results of this interdisciplinary research will add to the core knowledge in several areas of material science and electrical engineering, thereby delivering a transformative impact for applications of antiferromagnetic layered semiconductors. The intellectual merit of this project include knowledge of phonon and magnon band structures, and their modification with the thickness, strain, and electric bias; experimental data for controlling the Néel temperature in two- dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductor films; mechanisms and methods for tuning the phase transitions in AFM semiconductors under the action of gate and strain; innovative approaches for enabling novel device functionalities via control of the electron, phonon, and magnon states in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.

Collaborative Research: Gravitational Waves as Messengers from the Early Universe,"The detection of gravitational waves (GW) has opened a new window for astronomy. GW astronomy holds the potential for helping reconstruct a picture of the universe at energy scales much higher (and at times much earlier) than the picture obtained using the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A research program between Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will use gravity as a tool to understand more about high energy physics and cosmology, as well as numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic processes in the early universe. The project also includes a broad range of education and outreach activities. There will be training of graduate and undergraduate students at both CMU and MIT, along with a vigorous public outreach program, including programs with local middle and high schools, an astronomy training unit with local disabled American veterans, a summer Teacher Training Program, and direct community engagement. The investigators will continue to invite visual artists, astrophotographers, videographers, game designers, and writers to share their cultural arts network for the promotion of science. The LIGO/Virgo detection of gravitational waves has ignited interest in the future direction of GW astronomy, including the search for intriguing signals of stochastic backgrounds from early-universe physics. The NANOGrav collaboration announced detection of a stochastic GW background that can be understood as possibly including a signal from the early universe, such as GWs from and shortly after inflation, cosmic strings and domain walls, phase transitions, turbulence and magnetic fields. The detection of such GWs is challenging due to their small amplitudes, the specific range of the characteristic frequencies, and astrophysical foregrounds. The focus of this research is a study of the GWs from turbulent sources possibly presented at (or around) the quantum (QCD) energy scale. The team will evaluate detection prospects of these GWs, with particular interest in modeling parity violating (chiral) sources that might explain matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe and investigating the range of the QCD epoch cosmological parameters that can be tested through the pulsar timing arrays.

Fundamental Gap Estimates and Geometry /Topology of Ricci Limit Spaces,"Various problems of mathematical physics can be modeled by the Laplacian or more general Schrodinger equations. The difference of the first two eigenvalues of the Laplacian is referred to as the fundamental gap, which represents the energy needed to excite a particle from ground level to the next level in quantum mechanics. The principal investigator will estimate the fundamental gap for various spaces. The proposed activities are related to optimal transport, information geometry and discrete geometry. The project will also support educational activities and diversity through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs; recruiting women and other underrepresented groups; organizing seminars, workshops and research programs promoting young scholars. The project is centered around Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis with three parts. The first is about the fundamental gap estimates of the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a horoconvex domain in the hyperbolic space and convex domain in locally symmetric spaces by comparison with some suitable 1-dim model. The second concerns geometry and topology of spaces with Ricci curvature lower bound, especially the fundamental group of noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature; minimal volume entropy rigidity for metric measure spaces with curvature lower bounds.

Collaborative Research: WoU-MMA: ASAS-SN in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics,"A research collaboration between the University of Hawai’i and Ohio State University will continue to operate the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), which is a network of 20 telescopes deployed at four sites around the globe with a scientific goal to provide a survey of the bright transient and variable astronomical sky. ASAS-SN is the first project to image the entire visible sky on a nightly basis to a visible magnitude of g~18, making the data public. The project discovers and observes approximately 300 supernova per year, and is also an important resource for other science such as active galactic nuclei and blazar flares, tidal disruption events, Galactic and Local Group novae, cataclysmic variables, and other transients. ASAS-SN triggers on events from other NSF-supported facilities, such as astrophysical neutrinos from IceCube and gravitational wave events from LIGO to search for the optical counterparts that are crucial to fully exploring them. ASAS-SN will continue to provide a critical training ground for the next generation of time-domain astronomers and the investigators plan future Citizen Science projects to classify detected objects. Targeted observations of multimessenger alerts can reach g~20 over 100s of square degrees in a few hours. It is a unique all-sky optical counterpart to other facilities searching for neutrinos, gravitational waves, and gamma rays. The depth of ASAS-SN is nearly perfectly matched to many spacecraft (TESS/Swift for imaging, and HST/CXO/JWST for spectra). Because ASAS-SN transients are bright and promptly announced, they frequently become the best-studied sources in any transient class. Many ASAS-SN sources and transients can be studied in detail for long periods of time, whereas fainter transients cannot. ASAS-SN discovers and recovers ~300 SNe per year, with ~3300 total projected by 2027, the majority with spectroscopic classifications. It will be the largest such sample for studies of rates and correlations by type or with host properties. ASAS-SN provides public databases of 600,000 homogeneously classified variable stars as well as continuously updated light curves of more than 100 million g < 18 sources. This enables new science across many sub-fields of astronomy. ASAS-SN also provides the community with a unique tool to obtain an up-to-date optical light curve for any point on the sky.

High-Precision Measurements of Planetary Rotation,"In this project, high-precision rotation measurements of Europa, Ganymede, and Venus will be acquired and interpreted to make advances in icy shell geology, geophysics, and astrobiology. The technique is Earth-based radar speckle tracking, in which radio waves are emitted by large transmitters towards these Solar System bodies and the radar echoes are recorded with our largest radio telescopes. This project trains a graduate student in observational astronomy. It also develops a module (teacher resource and student worksheet) that engages students in grades 3–5 about planetary astronomy, recognized as a gateway into the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This activity is expected to awaken or nurture a passion for STEM in young kids and set a fraction of them on a course towards a career in STEM. The rotational response of planetary bodies to a variety of forcings provides fundamental insights into their interior structure and rheology, their dynamical and thermal evolution, and core-mantle or shell-ocean interactions. This investigation will test models of the origin of Europa’s surface features, whether its ice shell is decoupled from its interior, and determine the rheology and moment of inertia of the shell. For Ganymede and Venus, this project seeks to determine their interior structure and provide insights into their dynamical, thermal, and magnetic field evolutions. Previous results from the radar speckle tracking observations have been confirmed at the 1% level by spacecraft observations. Project objectives are: (1) To confirm and improve the first measurements of the spin axis orientations of Europa and Ganymede, yielding obliquities with 10% precision; (2) To measure or place upper bounds on the amplitude of longitude librations of Europa; (3) To measure the orientation of the spin axis of Venus with 2” precision, the spin precession rate, and the polar moment of inertia with 4% uncertainties.

Career: P2 Beam Control and Measurement,"The P2 experiment at the Mainz MESA accelerator in Germany is an extremely precise parity violating electron scattering (PVES) experiment searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model using electron-proton scattering. The research program supported by this award is essential to achieving the high precision beam polarization measurements and parity quality beam for P2 to meet its stringent systematic uncertainty goals. The program includes designing a detector package for a novel atomic hydrogen polarimeter never before used in a parity experiment and would mark a significant technical development in the field of high precision beam polarization measurements. Additionally, the PI is committed to supporting the education of future scientists and creating and sustaining a positive, inclusive, safe, and professional research and training environment. This research program will train graduate students and postdocs to become world experts in polarized beam control. The main thrust of this research program is electron beam control and measurement for the upcoming P2 experiment, a high-impact experiment which will play a vital role in the MESA program. These research efforts will be geared towards two complimentary goals: (1) ensuring the achievement of parity quality beam for P2 to meet the stringent systematic uncertainty goals arising from beam asymmetries and (2) designing a detector package for a novel atomic hydrogen polarimeter never before used in a parity experiment for measuring the beam polarization to high precision. This effort will involve beam studies at MESA, polarized source development, designing a detector package for the planned Hydro-Moller polarimeter, participation in pre-P2 pilot experiments, and management of beam asymmetries during P2.

MAUNA: Multiphase Analysis of (U)LIRG Nuclear Activity,"Galaxies are made of stars, gas, and black holes. The interaction between these components determines how a galaxy, like our own Milky Way, grows over time. Stars and black holes may change the chemical content of the gas reservoir and/or eject it completely out of the galaxy through winds. The latter outcome, particularly prevalent in interacting galaxy systems, tends to stop future generations of stars from being formed in those galaxies. The investigators will analyze new observations of merging galaxies to trace the movement of gas as it traverses the galactic ecosystem, enabling a detailed understanding of this dynamic process. The investigators will also augment the Observational Astronomy Workshop at Lick Observatory through increasing graduate student participation and by adding a new science communication module to enrich the education and professional development of a diverse range of students. Leveraging new Keck and JWST integral-field spectroscopic observations, the investigators will study the hot ionized and warm molecular gas for a representative sample of galaxy mergers to establish the intricate nature of gas fueling and feedback and its role in galaxy evolution. Outflowing gas masses and energetics will be measured and compared to predictions from the latest feedback models across the temperature--density regimes.

A Precision Test of the Standard Model with Parity-Violating Electron Scattering,"This award supports research that seeks to answer a fundamental question about matter. What is the nature of new physics not described by the Standard Model - our current framework of how particles and forces interact? This question will be addressed by a precise measurement of the weak charge of the electron in a large collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, Virginia. The electron’s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the Standard Model. Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction could be evidence of yet undiscovered massive particles that represent new physics beyond our current understanding. The program will support graduate and undergraduate students, who will form an essential part of this project. The supported activities cover a range of hardware and software tasks that will provide excellent training for these individuals. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers both in basic research and in more applied research and industry. The funds provided by this award will support activities on the MOLLER experiment, a parity-violating electron scattering experiment at Jefferson Lab. The MOLLER experiment is an approved experiment making use of the upgraded 12 GeV accelerator at the lab. It will measure the electron’s neutral weak charge by making a precise measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer. This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders. The result would have excellent sensitivity to many beyond the Standard Model scenarios. During the period of this project, the research team will make important contributions to this experiment: construction and installation of the scattered beam monitor and scanner systems, coordination of the MOLLER beam charge monitor upgrades, installation of a halo monitor system, and data analysis code development.

Computing the electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures of black hole binaries,"Almost every galaxy has at least one supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. These giant black holes can grow to more than 10 billion times the mass of the Sun by pulling in gas and stars and by merging with other black holes. Such mergers rank among the most powerful cosmic events, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of low-frequency gravitational waves. The gravitational waves produced by SMBH binaries contain clues about the conditions in the hearts of massive galaxies, and they can tell us how the SMBHs have grown over cosmic time. This proposal will enhance the scientific potential of gravitational wave measurements by using computer simulations to see how SMBH binaries interact with their surroundings and by predicting how the host galaxies will appear in ordinary telescopes. The team will start a new outreach program to raise awareness of gravitational wave science, through multi-media simulations of gas moving around black holes. These will be shown at sports events in South Carolina. The main science objective is to advance the study of binary black holes across the mass spectrum, by providing new paths to their discovery with electromagnetic and gravitational waves. The investigators will carry out numerical simulations of binary-disk interactions in realistic but unexplored regimes. In the context of massive black hole binaries, they will compute the electromagnetic signatures of binary accretion and derive community tools to help optimize time-domain observing strategies and electromagnetically constrain the massive binary black hole population. They will compute the influence of environmental gas on binary evolution and distribute digital tables of the results to support forward modeling of the stochastic gravitational wave background through population synthesis. The team will explore stellar-mass black hole binaries using hydrodynamical simulations to predict how X-ray binaries evolve in response to dynamical mass transfer. Those results will be incorporated into a community binary population synthesis code, and they will help constrain the provenance of stellar-mass black hole and neutron star binaries that merge as high-frequency gravitational wave bursts.

"Band Engineering of High Mobility Pentagonal 2D Semiconductor via Layer, Strain, and Moire","Non-technical Description The most important attribute of an electronic and photonic materials is its band structure, which defines electrons’ movement and determines, for instance, whether the material is an insulator, a metal, or a semiconductor. One of the most exciting directions in materials science research is band structure engineering, which allows for tailoring device functionalities for technological applications. The goal of this project is to engineer the band structure of a few-layer PdSe2 that has a unique pentagonal structure with an underlying square lattice; it boasts high mobility, sizeable band gap, suitability for wafer-scale synthesis, and large nonlinear optoelectronic responses. Its band structure will be modified by controlling the number of layers, by applying uniaxial strain, and by creating a moiré superlattice by overlaying two PdSe2 monolayers at a small angle with respect to each other. By examining the consequent modifications in material properties, the project will lead to key advances in the rational design of novel functionalities, such as directional transport of charges and directional optical responses for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. This research project is integrated with a comprehensive education plan by involving undergraduate students from OSU and a local community college in research. The principal investigator will continue her successful mentoring of members from under-represented groups, including women and minorities, and participate in outreach activities, serving as a role model to next generation of scientists who are traditionally under-represented in STEM disciplines. This project will support 1-2 graduate students, who will be trained in nanofabrication, quantum transport, cryogenics, Raman and optical characterization, as well as “soft” skills such as written and oral communications, problem-solving, critical thinking, forming collaborations, and working in a team. These hard and soft skills are highly-sought after in careers paths in industry, government, and academia. Technical Description PdSe2 has an underlying square lattice, which sets it apart from the mainstays of 2D materials research that focuses on materials with hexagonal symmetry. This project aims at engineering the band structure of PdSe2, via selective symmetry breaking, using such knobs as layer, strain, and moiré. Specifically, the goals include optimization of materials properties for atomically thin PdSe2 field effect transistors, exploiting the even-odd layer effect of spin-orbit coupling in few-layer PdSe2, creating large band anisotropy via strain engineering for nonlinear anisotropic photodetectors such as polarization sensors, and achieving isotropic and anisotropic band flattening in moiré PdSe2 superlattices. In addition to advancing electronic materials via band structure engineering, successful implementation of the project will also provide a quantum simulator for solutions of the Hubbard model in a square lattice that are relevant to long-standing mysteries such as high-Tc cuprates, while lending insight into some of the “grand challenge” questions in the field, such as the general design principles of flat bands in moiré materials and the emergence of correlated phases arising from the interplay of topology, symmetry, and interactions.

IDAstro: Astronomical Research and Scholarship in the Gem State,"A collaboration of Idaho colleges and universities will establish a new partnership, the IDAstro program, to improve access for students to astronomy research in the State of Idaho. This program builds on the incipient connections between the astronomical research and education programs at each of the partner institutions and provides much needed support to Idaho students with the passion, but not necessarily the means to study astronomy. The primary partners are Boise State University, a “high research activity” (R2) university; College of Idaho, a private liberal arts college; and College of Western Idaho, a comprehensive community college. Other partners that will contribute to the collaboration are the College of Southern Idaho, a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and Idaho’s Dept. of Parks and Recreation’s Bruneau Dunes State Park. The program will pilot a substantive and sustainable partnership across Idaho to provide personalized mentoring, financial, and academic support for students most in need. The program will support multiple interwoven research programs, with a focus on utilizing the newly built observatory at Bruneau Dunes State Park, and will provide student researchers robust support for their work. Research topics will include exoplanet transit photometry and transit timing, photometric variability of energetic transients including Active Galactic Nuclei and Be stars, galactic star formation, and small-body (e.g., asteroid) occultations. The IDAstro program will provide a novel pathway for Idaho’s community college students to become involved in research early in their education and then continue this research involvement at a four-year institution. Some 40+% of students in Idaho are first-generation college students, many of whom come from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds. Students would have opportunities to conduct not only astronomical observations, but also public outreach and utilize a recently built, cutting-edge astronomical observatory at the Bruneau Dunes State Park.

Large-Scale Self Organization in Three-Dimensional Shear-Flow-Driven Magnetized Plasma Turbulence,"In the universe, smooth magnetic fields are observed in very large systems like galaxies and can be generated by electrically conducting flowing matter, such as a plasma. Plasma flows that change direction from one region to another are said to be unstable and spontaneously generate turbulence, which creates magnetic fields that are tangled instead of smooth. In this project, computer simulations will be used to explore how magnetic fields are created in turbulent plasma systems and how these magnetic fields become smooth. Examples of such systems include the generation of zonal flows observed in fusion plasma devices and are analogous to the bands that are seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter. This project will also examine how the large magnetic field structures that are seen in these flows break up and re-form to understand when and why this happens. This award supports a study of the formation of large-scale anisotropic structures in three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasma turbulence driven by a maintained unstable shear flow. The project builds on prior studies of two-dimensional (2D) magnetized plasma turbulence showing the sequestering of magnetic energy at large scales due to the excitation of a stable mode conjugate to the Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable mode. It also builds on analyses of 3D hydrodynamic turbulence, which have showed the generation of a zonal flow via a process involving the interaction of 2D unstable modes, weakly driven 3D unstable modes, and a conjugate stable mode. A versatile numerical modeling code Dedalus will be used for the project, employing newly developed diagnostics to track spectral energy transfer within the system. The project also includes a collaboration with the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research within the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.

CAREER: Brown Measure and non-Hermitian Random Matrices,"This CAREER award supports a five-year project in free probability, random matrix theory, and their applications. Free probability began as a subfield of the theory of von Neumann algebras, which in turn originated in a series of papers by Murray and von Neumann in the 1930s, as part of an effort to provide mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics. A key concept in free probability is the notion of free independence, which generalizes the classical notion of independence of random variables, enabling the development of a robust “noncommutative probability theory” in the setting of von Neumann algebras, where rich mathematical structure emerges from the interactions of objects known as free random variables (owing in part to the fact that their multiplication, like that of matrices of complex numbers, is not commutative). Methods from free probability are now a cornerstone of the structure theory of certain von Neumann algebras, and have applications to a variety of other fields, including random matrix theory and quantum information theory. In this project, the PI will study several important open problems on probability distributions of free random variables and explore their applications to random matrix models. The project integrates research with education and will provide research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, complemented by outreach initiatives to teach and mentor middle school and high school students, with a particular emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. The Brown measure of a free random variable is analogous to the eigenvalue counting measure of a square matrix. It is an extension of spectral measures of normal operators to non-normal operators. This measure encodes a great deal of information and can predict the limiting distributions of non-Hermitian random matrix models. In this project, the PI seeks to develop analytic techniques for computing the Brown measures of a diverse range of free random variables, motivated by operator algebras, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The boundary values of certain operator-valued subordination functions will be explored using tools in complex analysis, operator algebras, and noncommutative analysis. The project will investigate random variables formed through addition, multiplication, or polynomials of free random variables. The new Brown measure results will then be used to analyze limiting laws and the convergence of non-Hermitian random matrix models. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",453779,2024,2029,NSF,United States,United States,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
The Piezoelectric Effect and Long Range Order in Room Temperature Ionic Liquids,"Non-Technical Abstract Ionic liquids are a class of materials that have found wide use because of their unusual properties, ranging from the ability to sequester toxic gases to their use in certain energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors. Despite their wide use, ionic liquids exhibit a number of properties that are not well understood. It was discovered recently that ionic liquids exhibit the piezoelectric effect, which is the ability to produce electric charge when exposed to mechanical force. This effect was seen only in solids until this discovery, and the ability to use liquids to produce electric charge creates many opportunities for advances in technologies such as passive or wearable energy generation, and sensors. To realize such advances, it is essential to understand the fundamental physical and chemical basis for charge generation in ionic liquids. The goals of this project are to understand the size scale over which charge is generated in these materials, and how charge generation can be controlled and optimized based on the chemical structures and physical properties of ionic liquids. The work will be carried out by graduate students spanning the disciplinary areas of chemistry, physics and materials science. The training of scientists who can work at the interfaces between disciplinary areas is essential to the creation of a flexible workforce for science and technology that are in the National interest. Technical Abstract Room Temperature Ionic Liquids have found use in a variety of practical applications, but many fundamental issues remain to be resolved in understanding dynamics, structural order, and the response of these materials to external forces. RTILs exhibit the direct and converse piezoelectric effects. RTILs produce a potential upon the application of force and exhibit a free charge density gradient with a spatial extent of 50 micrometers when in contact with a charged surface. The existence of these effects in a fluid medium is without precedent and the reasons for these phenomena require a fundamental understanding. Experimental and theoretical investigations of RTILs have revealed organization of some type over a variety of length scales, but the “organization” is not well-defined. The existence of any type of organization over such distances is highly unusual for a liquid. Achieving a deeper understanding of this phenomenon and the recently-discovered direct piezoelectric effect in RTILs is essential to understanding how to utilize these materials. The goals of the proposed work are to establish a physical basis for the existence of the direct converse piezoelectric effects in RTILs, and to connect these effects to structural organization in RTILs. The primary goals of this project are to characterize the dependence and operative length scale of the piezoelectric effect on RTIL molecular structure and physical properties through a series of optical and electro-mechanical experiments, and to gain control over the magnitude of the piezoelectric effect in RTILs by deliberately inducing order through surface templating. This work is transformative because it will provide a new conceptual framework in which to understand ionic liquids and related materials, enabling technological advances in areas such as liquid phase, electronically tunable linear and nonlinear optical devices, and passive and wearable power generation. The larger purpose of this research project is to educate a diverse student cohort at the cutting edge of interdisciplinary science. It is imperative that the United States train students to be globally competitive for careers in science.

Quantum Enabled Probes of Open Quantum Systems,"Quantum technologies are poised to make significant impact in many areas of science and technology with applications in national health, industry, and defense. These technologies harness the unique properties of quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve tasks in a more efficient manner or in ways that are fundamentally impossible without quantum technologies. One of the nearest-term applications of quantum technologies is in the realm of quantum sensors. This project focuses on developing new types of quantum sensors that are enabled by quantum entanglement; they achieve an advantage over more classical sensors that do not harness this powerful quantum property. The project applies these sensors in the domain of open quantum systems, which seeks to find ways to understand and harness dissipation in quantum technologies. In this way, the project aims to demonstrate new quantum sensors, while also advancing quantum technologies broadly. In addition, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in quantum information and quantum sensing techniques. The project focuses on three key projects. The first project aims to leverage an entanglement-enabled probe to characterize memory’s role in quantum systems’ environments, investigating how entangled states can form an enhanced probe of the non-Markovianity of an environment. We plan to apply this probing technique to characterize a range of different decohering mechanisms in open quantum systems. The second project investigates new approaches to quantum-entanglement-enhanced metrology harnessing time reversal invariance. Here, we will utilize the entanglement between a probe and an ancilla to perform optimal sensing of unknown and fluctuating magnetic fields. The third project will investigate a transition between quantum and classical dynamics by manipulating a qubit array via quantum measurement. The project will advance the scale of quantum simulation efforts with superconducting qubits and continue to demonstrate how dissipation serves as a powerful resource for quantum simulation.

WoU-MMA: Core Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave Signature Predictions Based on 3D Ab Initio Models with Increasing GR Realism,"Core collapse supernova explosions are the death throes of massive stars. They are directly or indirectly responsible for the lion’s share of the elements in the Periodic Table – i.e., the building blocks of matter in the Universe, and of life – making them one of the Universe’s most important phenomena. Such an explosive event involves strong gravity, as described by Einstein (i.e., general relativity); the turbulent fluid flow of the star; the production, transport, and interaction with the star of elementary particles known as neutrinos; and magnetic fields. The neutrinos, aided by the turbulent fluid flow and the magnetic fields, power the explosion. Given such complexity, to understand core collapse supernovae we perform simulations on the world’s leading supercomputers, such as Frontier at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This project has two focuses: (1) Incorporating magnetic fields into our world-leading core collapse supernova simulations. (2) Predicting the gravitational wave emission from core collapse supernovae based on data from these simulations. Core collapse supernovae are one of three sources, the only one not yet detected, of gravitational wave emission for which NSF’s premier facility, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory, the centerpiece of NSF’s Gravitational Physics Program, was designed and built. Core collapse supernovae are the deaths of massive stars and are directly or indirectly responsible for the lion’s share of the elements in the Periodic Table, making them one of the Universe’s most important phenomena. They are multi-physics events involving general relativistic gravity, magnetohydrodynamics, and neutrino transport. The lion’s share of core collapse supernovae is powered by neutrinos, with assistance from instabilities of the stellar core fluid, such as turbulent convection, and stellar core magnetic fields. That magnetic fields aid in powering these explosions has been established. Their inclusion in core collapse supernova simulations is necessary. We focus on their inclusion in our next-generation core collapse supernova simulation framework, thornado, which currently includes modules for general relativistic gravity and hydrodynamics, and will soon include a module for general relativistic neutrino transport as well. thornado is based on numerical methods ideally suited to this application. We also focus on the computation of gravitational wave emission based on simulation data from our current production core collapse supernova simulation framework, Chimera. Core collapse supernovae are among the three sources of gravitational waves for which the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory, NSF’s premier facility, was designed and built, but the only source not yet detected.

"SMEFT, Collider, Primordial Black Hole, Dark Matter, and Gravitational Wave Phenomenology","This award funds the research of Professors James B. Dent, William Shepherd, and Joel W. Walker at Sam Houston State University. Dent, Shepherd, and Walker explore theoretical physics and its connections to experimental results in the areas of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), collider physics, primordial black holes, dark matter, and gravitational wave phenomenology. Effective field theory is a very general approach to organizing searches for new physics that is independent of any one specific model. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) generates the highest energy particle collisions of any machine on Earth, looking for the existence of unknown particles and interactions. Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have been formed in the very early history of our Universe, making them an attractive candidate to explain dark matter. Although the particle properties of dark matter remain mysterious, observations related to the motion and gravitational pull of galaxies and radiation left over from the early universe suggest that roughly one-quarter of the energy density of the universe exists in this invisible, non-shining form. Gravitational waves are vibrations in the structure of spacetime which provide clues about cataclysmic cosmic events such as the merger of black holes, as first observed in the last decade. This project will advance the national interest in fundamental science by exploring and connecting each of these research areas in particle physics, contributing models, search strategies, data analysis, and software tools. Significant broader impacts will be realized through the research inclusion of students at SHSU, a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a diverse population, more than half of whom are first-generation. This project will develop those students’ analytical, numerical, and creative skills, through participation in journal publications and conference presentations. That effort will help to create the foundation for students to thrive in a future doctoral program, or for successfully transitioning into technically demanding careers in industry. In addition, the professors are publishing a new textbook based on their “Physics Bootcamp” course at SHSU, which introduces essential first and second year mathematics in a physics context and will extend a successfully redesigned course for primary school educators to include online sections. More technically, the LHC physics program is currently transitioning into a long phase of high-luminosity data collection. Since new physics has not yet manifested in obvious ways, the community must shift concentration to processes which may be kinematically concealed, or which require large statistics for discrimination, or which are intrinsically rare. This project advances that worldwide effort by investigating collider signatures of new physics in terms of indirect effects encapsulated by the SMEFT, testing applications of a new scale-invariant jet clustering algorithm, and the development of public software tools that will facilitate such analyses, especially via machine learning. For PBHs, novel search avenues for detection and phenomenological links to BSM physics models will be explored, including connections between Hawking radiation, superradiance, and gravitational waves. For dark matter physics, direct and indirect detection efforts to characterize properties such as mass (focused in the sub-GeV mass range), spin, and non-gravitational interactions will be explored both theoretically and through interpretations of upcoming data such as that from LZ, XENON, and JWST. The connection between particle physics models and gravitational waves will be explored using current observatories such as NANOGrav and LIGO, along with upcoming observatories including LISA, in searches for gravitational waves produced in association with possible phase transitions in the early universe or from PBH formation.

Quantum Phenomena in Solids,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY All materials are made from elementary constituents -- protons, neutrons, and electrons -- which are governed the laws of quantum mechanics. Often this quantum-ness becomes hidden in their macroscopic aspect, but with care it can be revealed by modern techniques and harnessed to produce novel functionalities. This project focuses on the observation and manipulation of ""excitations"", which are particle or wave-like disturbances that move within a quantum material and can carry energy, charge, or information with them. The way in which these excitations are created, move, and interact reveal fundamental physics of the quantum world. Such motions also serve as the basis for diverse information and energy technologies. In this project, new theoretical techniques will be developed and specific predictions made to guide the experimental study and use of quantum excitations in materials. The first research thrust is on unconventional magnetic materials known as spin liquids, in which excitations called ""spinons"" act like fractions of electrons and experience strikingly different forces from those in normal experience. The theory developed in this project will reveal how spinons move and interact with one another, and guide their observation in modern experiments such as neutron scattering. Another type of excitation in quantum materials is the ""exciton"", which is a sort of pseudo-atom formed from electrons in a semiconductor that can both absorb and emit laser light efficiently. In a second study within this project, theory will be developed to show how dense systems of excitons under intense laser illumination change their quantum states. The final thrust of the project is to develop theoretical techniques to model the motion of quantum excitations on modern quantum computers. The new methods developed therein may enable the next generation of materials modeling on quantum devices. Training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers is an integral component of this project. These junior scientists will learn forefront areas of condensed matter and quantum theory, as well as develop general scientific, communication, and computational proficiency, through mentorship and collaboration on the research. These skills prepare them to participate productively in the nation's quantum workforce. TECHNICAL SUMMARY The nature of a quantum phase of matter is revealed through its quasiparticle excitations, and these quasparticles control the responses and properties of quantum materials. The goal of this project is advance the theoretical understanding of the dynamics of excitations in exotic quantum states, by developing new theoretical models and techniques, with applications to specific quantum materials of particular interest. The research is divided into three thrusts. The first thrust focuses on quantum spin liquids, in which frustration and quantum fluctuations induce a long-range entangled state which supports fractionalized emergent excitations such as spinons. This project develop the theory of dynamical correlations of spins and holes in spin liquids for detailed comparison with experiments such as inelastic neutron scattering, in order to break the bottleneck limiting progress in spin liquid studies. The second thrust concerns moiré excitons, which are a remarkable new platform for interacting boson physics beyond equilibrium, and the proposed work will elucidate the non-equilibrium aspects which are unique and novel, in particular the many-body physics of moiré excitons under strong laser illumination. The final thrust of the project is to develop theoretical techniques to model the dynamics of quasiparticles on modern quantum computers. The new methods developed therein may enable the next generation of materials modeling on quantum devices. Training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers is an integral component of this project.

ECLIPSE: Exploring physics of Multiphoton Ionization using Thomson Coherent Microwave Scattering,"This award supports an effort to develop a database of plasma photoionization processes that are of great practical importance for applications such as combustion and high-speed aerodynamics. Ionization of gas by means of intense laser radiation, a process known as photoionization, is important in the research fields of gaseous discharges and optics; and photoionization is broadly utilized in state-of-the-art optical diagnostics of combustion and high-speed aerodynamic flows, as well as in generation of laser filaments. However, numerous photoionization processes utilized daily in these research fields are weakly characterized, which can cause ambiguities. This project will utilize a novel technique to study a number of specific photoionization processes of particular relevance to the practical applications. The broader impacts of the project will also include engagement and mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students who will be involved in the project, and integration of the research results into several graduate-level courses. Wide general audiences will be reached via the production of a series of educational YouTube videos on plasma science topics. The project will use the recently developed method of Thomson in-phase coherent microwave scattering (TMS) to precisely characterize and understand photoionization processes that have great practical importance in multiple research fields. These fields include nonlinear optics and filamentation physics, as well as optical diagnostics of gaseous discharges, combustion, and high-speed aerodynamic flows. The diagnostics methods that rely on the knowledge of the photoionization processes include electric-field induced second harmonic generation, two-photon laser induced fluorescence, and femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging velocimetry. Specific research goals of the project include the development of a vacuum testing facility equipped with the TMS system and with an anechoic environment ideal for isolating the scattered signal from background environmental reflections, and characterization of the photoionization rates for several processes in a broad range of intensities up to ~ 100 TW/cm^2. This includes non-resonant photoionization of air, N2, O2, H2O, Ar, CO2, Ne, He, Kr, Xe, H2, and CH4 at 800 nm, non-resonant photoionization of He and N2 at 1064 nm, and (2 + 1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization of CO at 230.1 nm, NH3 at 305 nm, and H2O at 248.3 nm.

"WoU-MMA: Constraining and Understanding Extreme Astrophysics, Cosmic Magnetism and Dark Matter","The highest energy particles in the Universe are Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), whose energies are more than 100,000 times higher than the highest energy particles which humans have been able to produce in our ground-based accelerators. How Nature can produce such high energy particles has long been a major puzzle in astroparticle physics. The PI has recently proposed that UHECRs are produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, which can explain all the numerous constraints on their sources and has not yet been ruled out. With this award, the PI and her graduate students and collaborators will test the BNS merger hypothesis. They will develop tools to exploit information on individual UHECR composition coming from the upgraded Pierre Auger Observatory. The team has a wide-ranging broader impacts program including public lectures, mentoring of junior researchers at all levels, and investigating how to expand outreach to include older adults. UHECRs are charged particles and thus deflected in extragalactic magnetic fields, delaying their arrival relative to neutrinos, gamma rays and gravitational waves produced in the same event by hundreds of thousands of years. As well as discovering the origin of these highest energy particle messengers (UHECRS, Very High Energy neutrinos, and gamma rays), this project will characterize in detail the Galactic magnetic field and understand its origin, and make progress identifying Dark Matter and constraining its interactions with ordinary matter. This will help to backtrack UHECR arrival directions and anisotropies, trusting that the nearest sources may stand out sufficiently over the ensemble contribution to be identifiable. As it is difficult to infer the properties of individual UHECR events, the study includes applying generative AI techniques to tune model parameters more accurately, working with expert collaborators at the Simons Center for Computational Astrophysics.

Expanding the Gravitational-Wave Detection Horizon to High Redshift,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. In the last decade, gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window into the Universe. A century after Einstein predicted gravitational waves, NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) rewarded decades of investment with the first direct observations of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars. With improvements in sensitivity, gravitational-wave detectors will drive transformative discoveries across physics, astronomy, and cosmology in the coming decade, observing millions of black holes and neutron stars across cosmic time, probing the nature of the most extreme matter in the universe, and exploring open questions in gravity and fundamental physics. This award supports research to develop new adaptive optical technology critical to extending the astrophysical reach of gravitational-wave detectors and enabling future facilities. By clearing a key technological hurdle toward a next-generation gravitational-wave observatory, this award will ensure that gravitational-wave science continues inspiring young scientists across the country to fulfill their potential as the world-leading researchers of the future. The award will support the training of students in STEM areas. The main goal of this project is to develop and deploy new adaptive optical technology to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors by a significant factor, expanding their detection horizon past a redshift of 5 and enabling new tests of strong-field gravity, cosmology, and dense nuclear matter. The project is integral to realizing a planned upgrade of the LIGO, known as A#, and will also help lay the foundation for a next-generation U.S.-based gravitational-wave observatory, Cosmic Explorer. These improvements primarily target LIGO's quantum-noise-limited detection band above 200 Hz, where some of the most impactful observations—black hole ringdowns and binary neutron star mergers (with potential particle or electromagnetic counterparts)—stand to be made. They will be achieved through improved control of thermal distortions of the optics, enabling a fourfold increase of the laser power, to 1.5 MW, and higher levels of squeezed light enhancement. Modeling indicates this will require a qualitatively new form of active wavefront correction in the test masses, targeting finer spatial scales. The proposed work will deliver these critical new corrective capabilities.

Heavy Quarks: A Window Beyond the Standard Model at the LHC,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) probes unprecedented energy scales. Its primary mission, to push the frontier of high energy physics, has had enormous success with ATLAS and CMS’s discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The collaborations have amassed considerable data ten years after the Higgs discovery and are starting a new era of data collection. This award will support a new research group at Northern Illinois University working on the ATLAS experiment. The group will extend the current ATLAS search program for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) with a novel Vector-Like Quark (VLQ) search and improve a classic analysis (with several top and bottom quarks in the final state) dedicated to heavy vector resonances predicted by a wide array of BSM theories. Both searches aim to tackle theories that, if confirmed, would be crucial to explaining the Standard Model’s known limitations. It also includes a significant participation in improving one of the trigger systems of ATLAS for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the global trigger. The global trigger is a vital part of the ATLAS detector that needs to be upgraded to maintain or improve the excellent trigger performance at the challenging HL-LC conditions. The global trigger is based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) technology, which presents unique challenges. Implementing complex algorithms in FPGA is a fascinating problem with applications beyond HEP. The activities described in this proposal will be performed in the context of the ATLAS Collaboration, an international effort comprised of over 5000 members, physicists, engineers, technicians, and support staff. More than 183 institutions from 39 countries work together with a common goal.

RUI: Cal Poly Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamics Research at SLAC,"Cal Poly Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamics Research at SLAC This award will enable Cal Poly to continue its research, teaching, and outreach activities in Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamics (SFQED). This award is intended to improve our understanding of quantum electrodynamics in conditions where strong electromagnetic fields exceed the critical field, or Schwinger limit (~1.3x1018Vm-1). Experimental research will be conducted at the Stanford National Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Menlo Park, California, one of the world's leading accelerator facilities. The experiments involve colliding a high energy electron beam with a powerful laser pulse at SLAC's Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests-II (FACET-II). SFQED phenomena in nature will be explored as a result of these interactions. With this award, the FACET-II facilities at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will be used to enhance particle physics research, teaching, and outreach at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). It is intended that the proposed work will: i) participate in the SFQED collaboration (E-320) shifts and data collection at SLAC both remotely and in person; ii) simulate nonlinear Compton scattering and vacuum pair production for the E-320 collaboration; iii) integrate particle tracking from the beam-laser collision point to the beam detectors into the simulation code to facilitate detailed comparisons between simulations and experimental results; iv) install and commission the newly developed beam diagnostics developed during the previous grant cycle to measure nonlinear Compton scattering; v) Continue to design and develop a single positron calorimeter upgrade. Cal Poly undergraduate students will have the opportunity to gain research experience in SFQED and FACET-II operation during the summer at SLAC and during the academic year at the university as part of this research.

NSF-BSF: Many-Body Physics of Quantum Computation,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports research, education, and outreach activities with a goal to develop theoretical underpinnings and specific quantum algorithms, which may be implemented on the modern-day quantum computation platforms. The last decade witnessed a tremendous progress in the development and manufacturing of prototypical quantum computers. Though still noisy and subject to errors and decoherence, they are already capable of performing non-trivial tasks. This brought a quest for meaningful computational problems, which may be tackled with the help of available quantum architecture. One such problem is optimization, that is finding an outcome (i.e. a sequence of bits), which optimizes a certain intricate set of criteria (known as a cost function). From the physics perspective, this is a problem of finding low energy states (i.e. cooling) of a disordered media (aka glass). The project will implement such glassy landscapes with available qubit platforms and develop cooling protocols utilizing the quantum dynamics of their constituent elements. It was realized that the ideal quantumness greatly facilitates cooling. The project will investigate the effectiveness of real-life noisy-dissipative qubit arrays to accomplish these tasks. It will develop specific algorithms, implement them on commercially available devices (utilizing the NSF Cloud Bank funding mechanism) and compare their performance with theoretical expectations. The award also facilitates the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the US STEM workforce through development of quantum computation curriculum, preparing review articles, organization of workshops, and summer schools. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports research, education, and outreach activities with a goal to develop a theory and protocols for specific quantum algorithms, which may be implemented on commercial platforms, available through the NSF Cloud Bank. On the theory part, the qubit arrays represent examples of open dissipative quantum systems, which are driven by time-dependent local fields and couplings. Such a driven-dissipative environment can be modeled by the Lindbladian. The project will extend theoretical tools of non-equilibrium quantum field theory, to incorporate Lindbladian dynamics. One of the goals of this construction is to elucidate the existence and properties of the many-body localization transition in the Hilbert space of the array. Understanding of such transitions is crucial to developing protocols for the effective quantum cooling (i.e. approximate quantum optimization). Specifically, cooling of the glassy many-body localized phase may be achieved through periodic quantum melting through the first order transition and refreezing through the second order transition. The project will develop a theory of such dissipative cooling cycles and implement them on the D-Wave 5000-qubit platform. It will also develop tools for analyzing the resulting “experimental” data sets. The award also facilitates the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the US STEM workforce through development of quantum computation curriculum, preparing review articles, organization of workshops, and summer schools.

CAREER: Quantifying Uncertainties of Ab initio Nuclear Structure Calculations for New Physics Searches,"The Standard Model of particle physics describes nearly everything we can observe in the universe, but we know that it must be incomplete, because it does not explain gravitation, the dark matter that makes up 85% of the mass of the universe, or why there is more matter than anti-matter. Proposed theories that extend the Standard Model to explain these effects typically predict the existence of new particles. In principle, these new particles can be directly searched for with particle colliders. An alternative is to perform very precise measurements to find signatures of the new physics encoded in tiny deviations from the predictions of the Standard Model. These experiments can often be performed on a table-top device. The challenge is that, beyond exquisite experimental control, these searches require very precise predictions of the Standard Model. Often this requires calculating properties of the atomic nucleus, which is a strongly-interacting quantum mechanical many-body system. Historically, such a problem was intractable. But recent developments in nuclear theory have placed precise calculations within reach. This project aims to improve the nuclear theory to the precision needed for searches of new physics. The goal of ab initio nuclear theory is to begin with the force between protons and neutrons and directly solve the quantum many-body problem. Exact solutions are not possible, and so the approach is to formulate an approximation scheme in which tractable calculations systematically approach the exact solution. A crucial feature is the ability to estimate the effect of what has been left out. This project will focus on a many-body method called the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG). The systematic approximation employed in the IMSRG is that interactions between pairs of nucleons are retained while effects acting on three or more particles are neglected. Including three-particle interactions while neglecting four-particle interactions would yield an improved approximation at greater cost which is just beyond the capabilities of current supercomputers. The goal of this project is to develop a tractable approximation to keeping three-particle interactions, and a framework for estimating the size of what is left out. This will enable the precise calculations with theoretical error bars needed for precision searches for new physics.

Technology and Methods to Optimize Current and Future Ground-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors,"The research supported by this award aims to advance the field of interferometric gravitational wave astronomy by increasing the sensitivity of existing LIGO detectors and developing new techniques and methods for application to future gravitational wave detectors including Cosmic Explorer. The immediate scientific benefit of improved sensitivity of these detectors is more astrophysics discoveries and a better understanding of the universe. The US has held a leadership role in gravitational wave astronomy since its inception. Research supported by this award is key to maintaining this position over the next decades. However, this research has impacts that go beyond those directly made in the field of gravitational wave detection. The experiments and simulation tasks carried out here provide ideal training grounds for junior scientists. These students will join the PI’s research group, where they will be strongly encouraged and supported to develop their networks and STEM careers within the international research community via collaborations. With continued focus on inclusivity and support for junior group members, the PI supported by this award works to do his part to move the field of physics towards a more equitable situation for female scientists and scientists from under-represented groups. The work aims to improve the sensitivity of future gravitational wave detectors. Specifically, the research will focus on three areas: simulations to support LIGO commissioning and future detector designs, development of a new method for sensing optical imperfections in laser interferometers, and investigations into the possibility of using a new beam shape to reduce one of the fundamental noise sources in laser interferometers: thermal noise. The LIGO detectors are constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in precision metrology. They now regularly manipulate the quantum uncertainty of light measurements to achieve better sensitivity to gravitational waves and operate close to their theoretical optimum performance. These achievements are only possible thanks to on-site and remote simulation-based commissioning activities, which this award partially supports. The next-generation US ground-based gravitational wave detector Cosmic Explorer is currently in the conceptual design phase. It is crucial to apply our understanding of LIGO's operation and limitations to the design of Cosmic Explorer to maximize the likelihood of its future success. Thermal noise is also a limiting factor in other areas of cutting-edge research, such as optical clocks. The research supported by this award may therefore have cross-cutting technical impact beyond gravitational wave astronomy.

"Understanding Emission, Absorption and Energy Transfer Involving Classical and Quantum Light Interacting with Molecules","With support from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor George Schatz of Northwestern University is developing new theory and computational methods for characterizing processes that occur when molecules absorb and emit light. One project is concerned with the rate of transfer of energy in the excited molecule to another molecule, where theory will be developed that describes the process in terms of electrons excited in the donor molecule that transfer their energy to electrons in the acceptor molecule. By using a special model of interactions of electronic states of the molecules, the theory makes it possible to incorporate the influence of other nearby molecules or nanoparticles on the energy transfer process, and in some cases leading to enhanced rates or increased range of transfer, as is important in many kinds of optical devices. Another component of the research is concerned with the influence of quantum light in the form of entangled photons on the light absorption. Here time-dependent quantum theory is used to study the evolution of entanglement as energy transfers from light to electrons (i.e., converting quantum light to quantum electrons). Also being studied are the properties of molecules that are in the entangled states to understand how their properties are different from those in unentangled states. This work is fundamental to technologies involved in photon-based quantum computers and in devices for secure communications. The students and postdocs who work on this project, including a significant number of women and minorities, will be trained in theory development and computational applications that they can use for both academic and industrial jobs related to new device technologies. In addition, there will be outreach to K-12 groups, undergraduate training, numerous seminars and workshops, and communication with the public. Under this award, Professor George Schatz and his team will develop theories and computational methods for (1) describing single photon resonant energy transfer between molecules using real-time electronic structure methods, (2) characterizing the entanglement properties of molecular electronic (and vibronic) states, with emphasis on states that are excited by two-photon absorption, and (3) developing a time-domain description of the excitation of molecules by two-entangled photons that couples quantum electrodynamics to electronic structure theory to study the evolution of entanglement from photons to electrons as characterized using measures of the entanglement known as entanglement witness. The proposed research addresses several knowledge gaps that relate to the interaction of both classical and quantum light with molecules in complex environments. The use of real-time electronic structure methods for energy transfer provides the opportunity to describe energy transfer mediated by nearby molecules or nanoparticles. For quantum light that involves entangled photons, it has recently been demonstrated that photon entanglement can for some problems be converted into electronic entanglement, but the underlying rules for this are not known. The proposed research will use concepts from quantum information science to characterize the electronic entanglement properties of molecules that are important in two photon absorption, including collectivity/Schmidt numbers and Shannon entropy.

CAREER: Nuclear Matter from Chiral Effective Field Theory in the FRIB & Multimessenger Era,"The new era in multimessenger astrophysics provides novel opportunities for the study of strongly interacting, dense matter. Observational and experimental campaigns will address longstanding fundamental questions, such as: What is the nature of matter at extreme temperatures and densities? What nuclear processes drive the birth, life, and death of stars? And where do heavy elements, such as gold, come from? In this broader landscape, this project will leverage recent advances in nuclear theory to develop novel microscopic models of hot and dense nuclear matter with statistically quantified theoretical uncertainties. The outcome will be rigorous interpretations of the wealth of forthcoming observational and experimental data to advance fundamental understanding of strongly interacting matter and the structure and evolution of neutron stars. Furthermore, the integrated education plan will enhance public awareness of and literacy in nuclear physics and astrophysics in southeastern Ohio’s Appalachian region through a generally accessible poster series and public learning events. This project will combine chiral effective field theory (EFT) of low-energy quantum chromodynamics with advances in many-body theory, Bayesian machine learning, and high-performance computing to significantly improve microscopic hot and dense matter predictions with comprehensive uncertainty quantification. These developments will be critical to mining and capitalizing on the anticipated observational and experimental data to guide the construction of improved chiral EFT implementations and microscopic EOS models. The physics goals include deriving cutting-edge constraints of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) from a wide range of modern chiral interactions using automated many-body perturbation theory and rigorously quantified EFT-based uncertainties. Furthermore, novel microscopic EOS with improved thermodynamics for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers will be constructed, and their implications for neutron star properties will be studied. This research avenue is tightly connected to observational and experimental campaigns in the FRIB and multimessenger astronomy era. It will elucidate how predictive current microscopic EOS models are at densities between one and two times the nuclear saturation density, where chiral EFT, neutron star observation, and nuclear experiment intersect, among other important open questions in nuclear theory. This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.

Transport and thermodynamic phenomena in low-dimensional materials with flat bands,"The emergence of van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional materials has facilitated the construction of heterostructures with physical properties surpassing the combined characteristics of the individual layers. An example is the drastic transformation in the Dirac fermion band structure of graphene when it is precisely aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) or stacked with another graphene sheet at a certain twist angle, known as twisted bilayer graphene. These altered band structures have unveiled a myriad of emergent phenomena associated with electron correlations and topology. A common feature of many of  these heterostructures is the presence of flat, dispersionless bands responsible for the emergence of correlated phases. The goal of the project is to discover novel low-dimensional systems featuring flat bands and accomplish their comprehensive theoretical study by means  of a combination of analytic and numerical tools. In particular, we plan addressing three classes of perspective  low-dimensional system: (1) graphene multilayers in proximity to h-BN polarization superlattices, (2) twisted bilayer graphene in presence of  heterostrain, and (3) one-dimensional self-assembled graphene nanoribbons realizing pseudospin-1 fermion quasiparticles.The project combines competences of the Swiss partner in performing numerical simulations on atomistic models of materials and nanostructures with the expertise of the Ukrainian colleagues in using the analytic instruments of theoretical physics to address thermodynamic and transport properties of systems described by model Hamiltonians. The project is expected to reveal and characterize novel flat-band systems with a potential for realizing new correlated phases. Besides the making a contribution to the very frontier of the rapidly evolving field of physics of low-dimensional systems, the project has a potential to reveal novel platform systems for applications in quantum technology.",449892,2025,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Ukraine,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Compact star-forming galaxies and their impact on cosmic reionization and cosmology,"Compact star-forming galaxies found at low-redshift include some of the most metal-poor galaxies known today, strong emission line galaxies with properties comparable to those of typical galaxies in the early Universe, and strong Lyman continuum emitting galaxies, which are key to understanding the sources of cosmic reionization. For these reasons these galaxies are of great interest and importance both for our understanding of the first galaxies and for observational cosmology. Building on a unique sample constructed by the Ukrainian team, we propose to use available and upcoming multi-wavelength cutting-edge observations with the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes (JWST, HST), and other facilities, awarded to the UA-CH collaboration to:•Determine the key properties of metal-poor galaxies, their interstellar medium, and ionizing radiation field•Measure the production and escape of ionizing photons from compact star-forming galaxies across cosmic history•Test  the universality of recently-established indicators of Lyman continuum escape at z~0.5-3The latest measurements of galaxy populations at high-redshift, determined from deep JWST observations, and our understanding of galaxy properties will be included in state-of-the-art semi-analytic cosmological models predicting the HI 21-cm signal to examine how existing and future measurements of the 21-cm signal, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and other data can e.g. be used to:•Constrain the amplitude of density fluctuations in the Universe (s8)  and other cosmological parameters•Search for signs of and constrain non-gaussianity•Infer astrophysical parameters (e.g. X-ray heating from early galaxies) from 21-cm fluctuationsTo accomplish this we propose a close three-year UA-CH transdisciplinary collaboration gathering experts on galaxy observations and cosmology.  The requested funding is essential to assure a timely exploitation of the awarded JWST and HST observations, and to carry out the proposed simulations in preparation of upcoming 21-cm observations with Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and other facilities. The proposed project will thus shed new light on very metal-poor galaxies, our understanding of cosmic reionization, and cosmological constraints which can be derived from observations from the best/largest available telescopes facilities.",449607,2025,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Ukraine,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
ASPIRE - A Legacy Survey of Quasars in the Epoch of Reionization,"Distant quasars observed less than one billion years after the Big Bang are ideal tracers for studying the birth of the earliest supermassive black holes, the assembly of the first massive galaxies, and the buildup of the large-scale structures seen in the early Universe. The PIs will perform a detailed characterization of 25 such quasars by analyzing a legacy multi-wavelength dataset collected from the world's largest telescopes, covering a wavelength range from X-ray to radio. This program will advance our understanding of the growth of the first supermassive black holes, their interactions with quasar host galaxies, and the large-scale structures surrounding them. Additionally, they will collaborate with the Flandrau Science Center & Planetarium at the University of Arizona to develop a ""fusion-camp"" summer program that will have broad impacts on outreach and education. Theoretical models predict that the earliest billion supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form in massive galaxies and inhabit massive dark matter halos. The PIs will analyze a suite of multi-wavelength datasets collected from ALMA, VLA, and ground-based optical and infrared telescopes for a sample of 25 quasars in the epoch of reionization. These data, combined with data that is being collected from JWST, Chandra, and HST, will enable the team to resolve the long-standing question of whether the earliest SMBHs reside in the most massive dark matter halos and inhabit emerging large-scale galaxy overdensities. This program will also allow them to study the assembly of quasar host galaxies, understand the connection between AGN feedback and early massive galaxy formation, and constrain cosmic reionization and metal enrichment in the early Universe.

WoU-MMA: Enhancing the Neutrino Sensitivity of the Pierre Auger Observatory,"This research studies ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which are elementary particles and atomic nuclei from outside of our Galaxy which interact in the Earth's atmosphere and produce a cascade of particles called an air shower. The study uses the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) in the Mendoza province of Argentina, the world's largest operating cosmic ray observatory. PAO has 1,660 surface detector stations spread over 3,000 square kilometers, with four fluorescence telescopes. PAO is currently completing a significant upgrade, called AugerPrime, which will simultaneously measure both muonic and electromagnetic (photon, electron, and positron) components of extensive air showers. PAO detection of ultra-high energy photons or neutrinos traveling from their source without decay or deflection will elucidate the nature of the acceleration sites and improve our understanding of the extreme universe. This work is a key component of a broad multi-messenger approach for understanding the very high energy universe. The project involves students extensively and hosts public outreach both at the home institution and at the Visitor Center in Argentina. The present work uses the enhancements of AugerPrime to increase sensitivity for detecting ultra-high energy neutrino and photon-induced air showers. This makes detection more likely, and furthers PAO’s contributions to multi-messenger astrophysics. The research builds on previous accomplishments, moving from characterizing promising trigger algorithms to implementing those algorithms in the AugerPrime surface detector electronics, installing those systems in the field, and integrating with higher-level offline analysis software.

"Coarse-graining, Renormalization, and Fractal Homogenization","This project is focused on the development of new mathematics for analyzing the statistical behavior of physical systems which exhibit complex behavior across a large number of length scales. A typical examples include turbulent fluids, such as the earth's atmosphere, which have fluctuations on the human scale (a gust of wind) and on the continental scale (weather patterns), and every scale in between. Other examples include important models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Such chaotic physical systems have interesting behaviors which emerge through the interaction of these very different length scales, often called ""critical phenomena"" by physicists. Physicists have developed heuristic, non-rigorous ways of understanding and analyzing many such physical systems, some of which are called ""renormalization group"" arguments. One of the main goals of this project is to develop precise versions of these informal arguments which are mathematically rigorous. In the past decade, the work of the Principal Investigator (PI) and other mathematicians have led to a rigorous theory of ""quantitative homogenization"" of certain partial differential equations. These equations have some of the properties of the complex physical systems mentioned above, and the homogenization theory resembles renormalization group-type arguments in important ways. However, it currently works well only for problems with a small number of length scales. The project proposes to increase the level of sophistication of the homogenization methods until the theory can be deployed more flexibly on physical systems exhibiting critical behavior. This requires the development of new mathematical ideas and concepts and will require input from analysis, probability theory, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. The project has two main goals. The first one concerns improving the quantitative homogenization theory, so that it is more explicit in its dependence on important parameters in the equation (like the ellipticity ratio) and allows for degenerate and possibly unbounded coefficient fields. This is a well-known open problem in the subfield, but the PI and his collaborator Kuusi have made recent progress on this question, and this project will continue to develop these new ideas. A second focus of the project is to use these analytic methods developed for homogenization as means of formalizing heuristic renormalization group arguments in physics. Such methods arise in a wide variety of contexts, but the project has a few specific problems in mind. One arises in fluid turbulence, and concerns proving the anomalous diffusion of a passive scalar advected by a rough vector field. The PI and his collaborator Vicol have made recent progress on this question by using homogenization to formalize a renormalization group argument. This points the way to further possibilities, including the construction of more physically realistic examples of anomalous diffusion. Another potential application lies in Euclidean field theory, following a stochastic quantization approach to study Gibbs measures.

High-Frequency VLBI as a Tool for Stellar Astrophysics,"This research program will deepen our understanding of the final stages of stellar evolution, specifically focusing on red giants, which play a crucial role in enriching our Galaxy with elements essential for forming new stars and planets. The investigators will study how these dying stars shed mass through molecular ""masers”. Masers are the radio wavelength equivalent of lasers, and they arise from molecules in the atmospheres of some red giants owing to the specific combination of gas density, temperature, and velocity. The presence of masers provides a unique tool to study the gas motions and physical conditions within these stars. This investigation will employ the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), extending observations to wavelengths as short as 1 millimeter. This research program will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, fostering the next generation of scientific talent. Additionally, collaboration with science educators will produce accessible podcast episodes that communicate project findings to the public, enhancing scientific literacy and engagement. The project addresses critical gaps in our understanding of late-stage stellar mass loss, particularly focusing on the mechanisms driving winds from red supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars. These winds are major contributors to the enrichment of galaxies with heavy elements and dust. The study will utilize VLBI observations across multiple frequencies, including unprecedented measurements above 200 GHz, enabling spatial resolutions as fine as 10–500 microarcseconds. This high resolution is essential for mapping the regions where stellar winds are launched, particularly using SiO maser lines. Methodologically, the project will develop advanced data processing techniques and calibration methods tailored for high-frequency VLBI observations. These innovations will be shared with the wider scientific community, enhancing the capability to study complex astrophysical phenomena. Coupled with ongoing research on evolved star atmospheres, this effort promises to deliver some of the most comprehensive views to date of red giant dynamics. In addition to its scientific contributions, the project will produce two podcast episodes aimed at broadening public understanding of stellar evolution and its implications. These episodes will feature project updates and interviews with team members, contributing to public engagement with astronomy and astrophysics.

The Active Asteroids Citizen Science Project,"Active asteroids are crucial for understanding the distribution of volatiles, such as water, in the solar system. The population of active objects on the boundary between asteroids and comets (between the asteroid belt and Jupiter) is not well understood. The Citizen Science Active Asteroids project currently has over 8,500 volunteers who have classified nearly 500,000 archival images of asteroids and other small solar system bodies. Classifications made through the Citizen Science program are the primary method of new asteroid activity discovery in this proposed work. The project will examine the most promising candidate active asteroids with in-depth archival searches and follow-up telescope observations. This project will observe dozens of targets each month across several nights and at more than one telescope facility. The team will characterize the newly-discovered activity on these objects. Citizen Science is one of the most interactive forms of outreach and through the Zooniverse platform, the team share the exciting motivation behind the project, the mystery to be solved, and train the volunteers to classify tens of thousands of images each month. Discovery of activity on asteroids and other objects, such as comets and Centaurs, through the Active Asteroids project involves (1) retrieving and processing publicly available image data of minor planets, (2) preparing and uploading image cutouts to the Zooniverse Citizen Science platform, (3) determining candidate active objects using statistical metrics on classification data, and (4) performing archival searches for activity in images of candidate active objects. The project predicts that volunteers will classify more than 1.5 million additional images and should discover on the order of 30 new active asteroids. The classification data and discoveries from the Active Asteroids project will provide an ideal AI training set for the development of optimized detection algorithms in preparation for Vera C.

NSF-GACR: Coherent Radiation of Electrons Interacting with Intense Laser Pulses,"The amount of radiation emitted by a large number of elementary sources, like atoms or accelerated electrons, is substantially increased by ``coherence,'' which arises when the sources are closer to each other than the wavelength of the emitted radiation. The most intense light and x-ray sources are characterized by a high degree of coherence and have made tremendous contributions to the progress in science and technology. This project investigates the coherence properties of radiation emitted in a collision of a strong laser field with a high-energy electron bunch, with the ultimate goal of producing coherent gamma rays, where a single photon has an energy higher than that of an electron at rest. Gamma-ray radiation can be used for producing matter-antimatter, for investigating nuclear material and handling nuclear waste, as well as for studying medical isotopes. The project combines the theoretical expertise at the University of Rochester with the numerical and unique experimental capabilities at ELI Beamlines in the Czech Republic, strengthening ties between the US and Europe in the field of high-intensity lasers. The project will also contribute to maturing the science case for a potential future NSF OPAL high power laser user facility at the University of Rochester. This project will employ methods from strong-field Quantum Electrodynamics to investigate the radiation emission spectrum from an ultra-relativistic electron bunch colliding with a strong laser field. First, the emission of one and two photons by two electrons will be considered, where it is expected that analytical and numerical results can be obtained. Then, the more general case of several electrons emitting multiple photons will be treated. Methods to enhance coherence effects beyond x-ray frequencies will be developed by working in the full quantum realm and by manipulating the incoming electron beam at the microscopic level. The ultimate goal is to ascertain the feasibility of realizing a gamma-ray free electron laser (FEL), which is one of the most ambitious unrealized goals of the scientific community. The experimental validation of the theoretical predictions will be performed at the ELI Beamlines laser user facility in the Czech Republic using the unique synchronized petawatt-scale laser and electron beam capabilities available at the facility.

"Quantum Dynamic Control of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Processes","The Project represents a coordinated experimental/theoretical effort in developing and testing 
quantum protocols. Within a worldwide academy and industry effort to develop quantum 
computers, based on quantum qubits and quantum Hamiltonian, the quantum protocols, i.e. well 
designed Hamiltonian acting on the qubits, represent important steps. Even if the qubits offer 
enormous computation power, the quantum target may be reached more efficiently, more rapidly 
and with more stability using properly designed quantum protocols. Within this Project These new 
protocols will be tested on the natural qubits easily assessed in worldwide research laboratories: 
simple atoms and molecules. The experimental and theoretical tools should be classified with the 
broad area of quantum optics, where the photons, typically from laser sources, create the control 
quantum protocols, and the atoms/molecules constitute the qubits where quantum information is 
stored and maipulated. The Project will apply this quantum control approach to open theoretical 
and experimental problems such as: implementation of a molecular all-optical spin switch via 
control of spin-orbit interaction, realization of molecular orientation, superadiabatic protocols
for the coherent control of cold atoms  and molecule, control of ultracold chemical reactions, 
and spin-polarized quantum emitters. 
The objectives of the project will be achieved via an intensive transfer of knowledge 
among the EU and TC participants in the consortium during the carefully planned secondments. 
The consortium members are well established specialists in various aspects of physics of light-matter

REU Site: Research in Symmetries at the University of Kentucky,"This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Kentucky. Ten undergraduate students per year will participate in the 10-week summer REU site in Physics and Astronomy. REU students will participate in research projects that address issues at the forefront of modern physics and astronomy: What is the origin of matter in the universe? Is there new high-energy physics which modifies the magnetic moment of the muon? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy that dominate the composition of the universe? What prevents stars from forming from the cold dense gas in the centers of massive clusters of galaxies? What types of phase transitions must be understood in terms of topological invariants instead of broken symmetries? What materials host exotic quantum spin liquid phases? REU students will be trained with knowledge and skills to address these fundamental questions. The REU program focuses on individual mentored research projects in nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and astronomy, loosely related through the central theme of symmetry. These research topics are part of the research programs of faculty mentors funded by NSF, the Department of Energy, and NASA, tailored for accessibility to 2nd and 3rd year undergraduates. They involve advanced physics techniques that are not normally available at smaller institutions. REU participants will work together with graduate students and postdocs in the lab, interacting daily with their mentors to produce publishable results in these areas at the frontiers of physics and astronomy.

CDS&E: Enabling Population Studies of Supernovae in the Era of Vera Rubin via Simulated-based Inference,"The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to discover over 10,000 super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe) annually, a significant increase from the around 100 known today. SLSNe are rare, exceptionally bright supernovae, believed to be powered by newly formed, highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars. This project aims to develop advanced statistical techniques to analyze this unprecedented volume of data, improving our understanding of the progenitor systems and the properties of these magnetars. The methodologies developed can be applied to other SN classes. Additionally, the research team will create an online game that allows users to classify supernovae based on LSST light curves. The game will be featured at the annual Cambridge Science Festival and made available online, engaging and educating a broad audience about these extraordinary cosmic events. A set of LSST SLSNe will be simulated using archival light curves and incorporated into the PLAsTiCC dataset. A custom classifier will be developed to identify SLSNe with high accuracy, and both the datasets and classifier will be made publicly accessible. Second, a new inference pipeline for SLSN light curves will be created, utilizing simulation-based inference (SBI), and its performance will be thoroughly studied under various conditions. A Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework will be implemented to combine individual event data and correct for observational biases. Finally, the first year of LSST data will be analyzed to place the strongest constraints on the underlying SLSN progenitor population.

Galactic Imprints of AGB Outflows: Linking Second-Generation Planetesimal Formation to White Dwarf Pollution and Emergence of Interstellar Objects,"The fate of many stars, such as our Sun, is to collapse to a small, but very hot, White Dwarf (WD) star. These WDs cease fusing light elements into heavy elements and slowly cool. Astronomers find a large abundance of heavy metals, like iron, in the atmospheres of many WDs. Theoretically, these elements should sink quickly in white dwarf atmospheres and disappear. This suggests that rocky material must fall onto the white dwarf surfaces continuously. Current understanding of this problem invokes the breakup of ancient asteroids, due to the gravity of large planets. This idea, however, is increasingly at odds with observations. The investigator proposes a new solution, that heavy elements come from collisions with the dusty outflows of dying stars. The study will explore how these planetesimals form, how their orbits change, and how they pollute white dwarfs. The research will give new insights into the final stages of planetary systems and the life cycles of stars. It will also support education and diversity through outreach programs with high school students and teachers. The project will be carried out in three main tasks. First, it will investigate how second-generation planetesimals form in the dusty outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Second, it will analyze the orbits of these planetesimal halos to see how much material stays bound to the white dwarfs versus how much is ejected into space. Third, it will model the process of white dwarf pollution through long-term simulations to understand how material moves to white dwarf surfaces and the dynamics within the planetesimal halos. By challenging current theories and proposing a new idea, this project aims to solve gaps in existing models of white dwarf pollution, using advanced computational tools to give new insights into the evolution of stars and planetary systems.

"Molecular Multiferroics, Quantum Magnets, and Spin Qubits under External Stimuli","With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Janice Musfeldt of the University of Tennessee is using a variety of spectroscopic measurements to study the properties of molecular multiferroics under high magnetic fields, pressure, and strain. These compounds exhibit tunable chemistry and competing phases with overall low energy scales. By applying external stimuli, molecular charge, orbits, structure, and magnetism change. Dr. Musfeldt and her students will measure these changes to develop phase diagrams, reveal coupling processes, test the role of chirality in establishing functionality, and establish routes to previously unobserved phases. Their discoveries could address questions related to the chemical and physical tunability of molecular quantum materials. This project will help to build the future workforce at the chemistry/physics interface as students performing these experiments will be trained in spintronics and quantum information science. Under this award, the spectroscopic properties of molecular multiferroics, quantum magnets, and spin qubits under external stimuli will be studied using dichroism, Raman, and infrared spectroscopies to reveal new states of matter in these chemical systems. Interactions between the charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in these compounds are sought. Structure-property relationships will be explored by examining nonreciprocal effects, testing strategies for eliminating vibronic decoherence, and tailoring the metal environment in color change materials. By combining light-matter interactions of the molecular multiferroics under well-controlled extreme conditions, the team seeks to develop improved approaches to chemical and physical tunability. The Tennessee team will also pursue the development of underlying theory and examine key quantum information concepts that relate to the behavior of these molecular multiferroics when placed under external stimuli. In this way, these studies have the potential to make important contributions to the understanding of quantum materials.

Room Temperature Superradiant Perovskite Lasers (SUPERLASER),"Coherent light sources are limited to state-of-the art lasers such as free-electron gas or solid-state semiconductor gain media stabilized to high-quality optical cavities. However, the mirrorsin these cavities vibrate as a result of thermal noise, causing time-integrated phase drifts that limit the laser linewidth. To achieving high power and extremely narrow linewidth resembling that of single optical transitions, while also finding pathways for e-waste reduction, requires ingenious solutions in both gain material and device design but still remain elusive. SUPERLASER aimsto change the field of lasing by developing green low-cost,solution-processable efficient and ultra-narrow linewidth superradiant halide perovskite lasers. This goal will be accomplished by predicting and developing targets to transforming coherent light generation through scientific designs and strategic developments at the material and device level towards synergistic outcomes across scientific, technological and ecological boundaries. The project prioritizes research innovation and sustainability, focusing on the prediction of halide perovskites with strong inherent spu and the successful development of continuous superlatticesbased on the predicted materials. These superradiant emitters are expected to act as topological lasers without any additional cavity requirements due to photonic crystal properties endowed by their non-trivial topology. They will be applied as gain media combined with energatically matched charge transport materials to fabricate the first electrically pumbed perovskite lasers working at room temperature. Finally, we will apply recycle and reuse protocols to ensure zero e-waste for the developed technology.",434967,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Quantum Physics
"Collaborative Research: Tracing Cosmic Structures with Galaxies, Quasars, and Gas at Cosmic Noon","Galaxies come in wide variety of shapes, from great star-forming spirals like our own Milky Way galaxy to the red-and-dead elliptical-type systems. For some time, astronomers have known that this diversity is largely driven by environment, with galaxies in dense regions evolving differently from those in low-density voids. To understand this diversity we must look ~10 billion years into the past and survey large swaths of the universe at “cosmic noon”, when the universe was only ~1/4 its present size, star-formation and black hole activity peaked, and the great cosmic structures we see today were just beginning to form. By characterizing the galaxies' 3D environments, the team will quantify the relationships between a galaxy’s physical properties, such as its elemental composition, gas and dust content, stellar mass, and star-formation rate, with its environment. The team will also participate in a series of local education and outreach activities in Pennsylvania and Indiana, with a particular focus on engaging students in grades 4-12 to spark their interest in science. This program is aimed at elucidating how galaxies, quasars, and gas trace the cosmic structures of the 2 < z < 4 universe, and likewise, how dense environments within the large-scale structure influence their evolution. To do this, the program will combine the data products of three large surveys: imaging from the One-hundred-square-Degrees In Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, wide-field integral-field spectroscopy of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy eXperiment and targeted spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument of up to several hundred thousand Lya-emitting galaxies at cosmic noon, residing in a wide range of large-scale environments. This unprecedented dataset will (i) confirm ODIN-detected cosmic structures and reconstruct the 3D shape of tens of massive protoclusters; (ii) identify rare astrophysical sources such as Ly-alpha blobs and active galactic nuclei (including quasars), in order to investigate their locations within the large-scale structure; (iii) infer the mean physical properties of galaxies as a function of large-scale environment based on their photometric and spectroscopic measurements; and (iv) study how intergalactic gas and galaxies trace the underlying matter distribution and each other.

Physics Beyond Standard Model with the CMS Pixel Detector,"Physics Beyond Standard Model with the CMS Pixel Detector This award is centered on the CMS experiment currently running at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012 was a crowning achievement for the Standard Model (SM), currently the best theory to describe the most basic building blocks of the universe. However, there is ample evidence that the SM does not explain, for example, the nature of the dark matter (DM) and dark energy, matter-antimatter asymmetry and neutrino oscillations, to name a few. Physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) refers to the theoretical developments required to explain the shortcomings of the Standard Model. The current capabilities of the LHC enable improved Standard Model measurements, BSM physics searches, studies of flavor physics of heavy quarks and leptons, properties of the Higgs boson, and matter at high density and temperature. These could also shed light on the origins of the DM that might be concealed in as-of-yet untested BSM physics processes. In addition, to enhance its capabilities, LHC also plans its major upgrade, called the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider HL-LHC) that would crank up its performance by a factor of 10 beyond the current design value. There is also a planned matching upgrade of the LHC detectors. The primary focus of this research is to exploit the capabilities of the current CMS pixel detector during LHC Run-3 to pursue BSM searches by exploring possible hidden QCD-like gauge sectors that could host strongly self-interacting DM candidates that might interact with SM particles through mediator portals and potentially be produced at the LHC. Compared to its previous iteration, the current pixel detector has an extra barrel and endcap layers, a reduced material profile, a new readout chip to minimize data losses due to high pile-up of LHC events, and an optimized detector layout for 4-pixel-hit coverage over the full CMS pseudorapidity range. These improvements are key to the physics goals of this award as it leads to higher tracking efficiencies, lower fake-track rates, lower dead-time/data-loss, an extended lifetime of the detector, improved ""particle flow"" analysis and physics object identification including missing energy reconstruction. The precise measurement of 'missing energy' could unravel signatures of potentially undiscovered particles in many BSM physics processes, some of which could be candidates for Dark Matter and account for the graviton escaping in extra-dimensions or for other exotic particles possibly expected in BSM. This effort will also include activities in development and testing of additional pixel detector upgrades designed to fully harness HL-LHC physics capabilities while maintaining support of current Pixel Detector Operations. The spectrum of activities enabled by the above physics searches and detector work provides a fertile ground to train an advance STEM workforce. It brings an enormous opportunity of intellectual development and experience for our physics and engineering students. They would learn data analysis techniques, code related algorithms, develop software, use Machine Learning to improve physics reach and utilize LHC grid computing infrastructure. This skill set is key to pursue successful STEM careers in academia or the private sector. The synergy of outreach activities with Quarknet, centered around the exciting science done at the LHC, promotes a strong bond of collaboration with high school teachers. It leads to strengthening of teaching skills and learning around the schools in Puerto Rico and motivating students to pursue STEM disciplines.

MRI: Track 3 Acquisition of Helium Recovery Equipment for Quantum Materials Research and NMR Facilities at UT Austin,"Helium is a strictly nonrenewable and irreplaceable resource, whose price and availability are tied to the global oil industry and undergo turbulent fluctuations in recent years. On the other hand, liquid helium cooling is indispensable for investigating quantum matter at temperatures close to absolute zero and studying chemical reactions by nuclear magnetic resonance. The helium recovery system in this Major Research Instrumentation project recaptures the exhaust helium gas from low-temperature instruments and recondense it in a local facility. The equipment establishes helium recycling practice and enables the continuation of many frontier research activities in physics, chemistry, and engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. The availability of liquid helium also enhances the educational experience of physics and chemistry undergraduates during summer research and attracts underrepresented minority students to UT Austin through the American Physics Society Bridge program. The helium liquefier has a liquefaction rate that is sufficient to cover the usage on the entire University of Texas at Austin campus. The gas-collection system accepts recycled helium gas from the nuclear magnetic resonance facility. The combination of helium recovery and liquefaction improves the reliability of liquid helium cooling and reduces the cost for researchers. Research directions on quantum materials include the low-temperature microscopy of topological phases, optical studies of excited states, tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of correlated insulators, solid-state nuclear resonance on superconducting nickelates, and cryogenic nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy on collective modes. Research using the nuclear magnetic resonance facility allows scientists to characterize molecules in solution and solid phases for unambiguous structural assignment, monitor the rate of reactions, study the secondary structure of large molecules, and observe the interaction between molecules.

Pair Discharges and Magnetic Reconnection in Pulsars: Implications for the multi-wavelength emission,"Pulsars, or rapidly spinning neutron stars (NS), have been detected with radio telescopes for over half a century. However, the processes through which this radio emission arises remain enigmatic. The recent discovery of radio emission from fast radio bursts and magnetars, or highly magnetized pulsars, underscores the role of NS as key to understanding coherent emission in many astrophysical systems. A research team at the University of Maryland (UMD) will carry out first-principles numerical investigations of key plasma physical processes responsible for the generation of coherent radio emission. They will also investigate the physics behind the production of X-rays from both thermal and non-thermal processes in NS, as well as ultra-high-energy photons, associated to these processes. The proposed research will involve undergraduate and graduate students through semester- or year-long projects at UMD. The project will involve students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, who will be recruited through a new initiative at UMD’s Physics Department, “Pathway to Physics Ph.D.” The principal investigator will organize two summer schools for graduate students devoted to research on compact objects, where participants will become familiar with various theoretical and/or numerical problems at the forefront of research. Employing recent novel ideas about non-stationary behavior of pair plasma discharges and magnetic reconnection, the researchers will study how these fundamental plasma physics processes lead to the generation of powerful coherent radio emission and ultimately to thermal and non-thermal X-ray and TeV emission in pulsars. To achieve this ambitious goal, they will use modern multi-dimensional radiative kinetic numerical particle-in-cell simulations. At the time of completion of this project, the team will have produced ab-initio quantitative models of coherent radio, X-ray and TeV emission from pulsars. They will also test predictions from non-stationary pair discharge simulations of polar cap gamma-ray emission against the available limits and make testable predictions for future space missions. The proposal addresses issues that are at the forefront of high-energy astrophysics – interactions in ultra-strong magnetic fields, pair production, relativistic reconnection, particle acceleration and generation of coherent radio emission in the Universe.

"Cosmic Collisions, Relativistic Blasts, and their Remnants in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy","GW170817 is the name given by astronomers to the merger of two neutron stars witnessed through its gravitational wave siren, an associated gamma-ray burst, and its glow at all wavelengths of light. This discovery marked the beginning of a golden age in time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. A research team at Texas Tech University will use radio observations to study the physics of multi-messenger transients. While this group helps shape the path forward for multi-messenger astronomy, it will also undertake educational and outreach initiatives aimed at building the next generation of scientists. These will include training students in computing and data analysis through the Radio Astronomy Data Imaging and Analysis Lab (RADIAL), a partnership between the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and fourteen minority-serving institutions of higher education and sponsoring the yearly public Bucy Distinguished Lecture to further encourage participation of the general public and local minorities in STEM. This project has three main goals: (i) Conducting radio follow-up observations of neutron star - neutron star and neutron star - black hole systems discovered by ground-based gravitational wave detectors to constrain the physics of their ejecta and the nature of their remnants; (ii) Shedding light on the the similarities and differences between two types of stellar explosions: gamma-ray bursts and stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae; (iii) Exploring future multi-messenger observing scenarios with the next generation Very Large Array radio telescope and ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Mergers of neutron stars in binary systems observed through multiple messengers offer a unique opportunity to answer key open questions in a variety of fields, including gravitational and nuclear physics, relativistic astrophysics, and cosmology. Studying how neutron stars and black holes form and evolve, when isolated or paired in binaries, can shed light on the yet-to-be-understood diverse paths that bring massive stars toward their violent deaths, enriching the universe with its heaviest elements. Characterizing the properties of powerful blasts and ejecta from binary neutron star mergers and massive star collapses can give us invaluable information on particle acceleration mechanisms, magnetic field amplification, and the nature of the central engines powering the most relativistic cosmic jets. Unveiling the remnants of binary neutron star coalescences can constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter, providing a fundamental physics test.

CAREER: Quantum Optics for Future Gravitational-Wave Detectors,"The groundbreaking discovery of gravitational waves by NSF’s Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) provided a first glimpse of the profound potential that the rapidly growing field of gravitational wave astrophysics holds for the rest of the century. In 2023, the LIGO observatories reached their design sensitivities, able to detect binary neutron stars 500 million light years away. Unprecedented advances in Quantum-Enhanced Metrology over the last 2 decades have made this increased sensitivity possible. This award will establish a Quantum-Enhanced Metrology testbed at Syracuse University to test novel techniques and materials that will further advance the quantum improvement of gravitational wave detectors. In parallel, this award will inspire the next generation of scientists and non-scientists through various outreach projects and education opportunities related to the quantum world. The primary objective of this award is developing the technology needed to achieve 10 dB effective squeezing improvement to gravitational-wave interferometers. The goal of the LIGO observatories is 10 dB of effective squeezing, which currently operates 5-6 dB below the shot noise limit and a benchmark number for the next-generation observatory Cosmic Explorer. High levels of squeezing improvement are required for future detectors to reach their design sensitivities and to enable their science goals. The first stage of this award includes constructing a squeezed light source at Syracuse University. We will then use this testbed to investigate the integration issues of quantum-enhanced interferometers by coupling this squeezed vacuum state to a coupled arm cavity and signal-extraction cavity. This quantum optics and gravitational wave-focused research is associated with an education plan to excite and inform high school teachers, students, and the public about gravitational waves, quantum light, and experimental physics.

Extreme Quantum-Electrodynamic Plasma Physics,"This award supports a theoretical study of the behavior of matter in super-strong magnetic fields. Observational discoveries of compact stars in our galaxy that are extraordinarily strong magnets, called neutron stars and magnetars, brings modern science into an uncharted territory of enormous magnetic fields. This is where quantum mechanics, rather than everyday classical physics, describes objects as massive as our Sun. Recent advances in laser science and engineering allow the most advanced national laser facilities to approach regimes relevant for studies of such extreme conditions. The neutron stars and magnetars can be viewed as astrophysical laboratories for studies of the interplay of quantum effects in large classical systems, at scale not yet achievable at laser laboratory facilities. Broader impacts of this project include training of graduate students and outreach to students from rural areas and underrepresented minority groups. Magnetars -- neutron stars with magnetic fields exceeding a critical (or Schwinger) field -- are the primary astrophysical sources of interest where quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects strongly affect the behavior, properties and dynamics of plasma. State-of-the-art high-intensity laser systems are beginning to approach regimes relevant for studies of plasma under such extreme, super-critical field conditions. The upcoming laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations will allow one to probe into extreme plasma and astrophysical phenomena that were previously inaccessible. This project aims to lay the theoretical foundations for studying collective plasma phenomena in a strong field QED plasma. The primary goal of this study is the development of theoretical understanding of plasmas under extreme astrophysical conditions and the creation of a comprehensive knowledge base of extreme plasmas with full QED. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

Cosmology with the galaxy clustering measurement of the HETDEX survey,"Cosmology leaps to a new level each time we expand the distances-measurement horizon. The existence of the extragalactic Universe and its expansion was revealed only after reaching out to a few Mega light-years; subsequent extension of the horizon to a few Giga light-years led to the discovery of the Universe’s accelerating expansion. Cosmic acceleration indicates that new physics must operate on even greater cosmological scales, and astronomers coined the term Dark Energy to address this problem. Scientists at Penn State University propose to address the Dark Energy problem using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) galaxy survey data, which observed 1.5 Million galaxies within a cosmological volume (400 cubic Giga light-years) at tens of Giga light-years away. By scrutinizing the clustering of these ancient galaxies, the team will measure the Dark Energy density at the earliest time test whether Dark Energy varies in time. With the same dataset, the team will also study the physics of the early Universe that generated the initial seeds for the observed large-scale structure. As part of this project, the team will educate new Ph.D. students and create undergraduate research opportunities. The team will also engage in outreach activities at Penn State University by presenting public lectures during AstroFest and AstroNight and by organizing the Neighborhood Workshop on Astrophysics and Cosmology. The team will measure the Dark Energy density at high redshift (1.9 This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",429822,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Particle and High Energy Physics
Revealing the Origin of Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon,"In the nearby Universe astronomers have discovered that most galaxies are either actively forming new stars (appearing blue in color) or have ceased to form them (appearing red in color). In many ways, producing new stars is the most pronounced feature of galaxies in the local Universe, but there is no scientific consensus explaining why some galaxies cease forming stars. Part of the problem is that the end of star formation occurred in most systems billions of years ago, where we currently lack the necessary observations to fully understand their physical properties. This team of researchers will address this issue by utilizing data from an upcoming survey of galaxies targeting early cosmic times. In so doing, they will constrain this crucial evolutionary stage in galaxies, helping to resolve one of the long-standing mysteries in all of astrophysics – why are there two types of galaxies? The PI will establish a new program providing hands-on training in observational astronomy to undergraduate students of all majors. For this purpose, the PI will use the 24-in telescope on the campus of Florida International University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. This research team will utilize ‘VLT-MOONRISE’, an unprecedented study of about 500,000 galaxies observed with rest-frame optical spectroscopy at the peak epoch of galaxy formation (‘cosmic noon’: z = 1 – 2.5). This is a large (190-night) spectroscopic survey targeting early galaxies to be conducted on the Very Large Telescope in Chile over the next five years. This research project will combine these transformative spectroscopic observations with state-of-the-art cosmological simulations and sophisticated machine learning tools to rigorously test theoretical models of galactic star formation quenching at cosmic noon. In particular, this project will: (1) Reveal the fundamental physics of galaxy quenching at cosmic noon: ‘fuel’ vs. ‘efficiency’; (2) Test the AGN feedback paradigm of massive galaxy quenching at cosmic noon; (3) Identify the triggers of massive galaxy quenching – e.g., mergers, starbursts vs. AGN; (4) Determine the role of environment in quenching satellite galaxies at cosmic noon; and (5) Enable a census of star forming and quiescent galaxies across 10 billion years of cosmic history. Ultimately, this research will aim to reveal where and when in the Universe star formation is possible, explaining the fundamental bimodality in galaxy properties, which has remained elusive for decades.

Quantized Phonon Conductance of One-dimensional Systems,"Non-technical Abstract: The ability of a solid to conduct electricity and heat determines its application potential in new technologies such as microelectronics. Surprisingly, quantum physics predicts that the electricity- and heat- carrying capabilities of a solid at the nanometer scale do not reduce continuously with decreased cross-section. This quantum theory has been validated repeatedly in different experiments for both the electricity- and heat-carrying capabilities of electrons in different nanostructures. In comparison, there has been only one reported experimental observation of the predicted quantum behavior of the heat-carrying ability in a polycrystalline silicon nitride nanostructure. In response to a call for further experimental investigations of the quantum theory of lattice heat transport, this project is focused on experimental investigation of this quantum theory in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a unique measurement method. Success of this research is expected to both enhance the understanding of a essential pillar of condensed matter physics and provide education and outreach opportunities for broadening the participation in quantum and thermal science research and technology developments. Technical Abstract: Free of two-level defects, SWCNTs are closest to an ideal one-dimensional (1D) quantum system among the nanostructures that have been experimentally realized. The goal of this work is to advance multiprobe measurements of the intrinsic thermal conductance of 1D nanostructures for accurate detection of the quantized phonon conductance that has been predicted for a SWCNT at a relatively high temperature up to about 10 K. This temperature range is much more conducive to producing unambiguous experimental evidence of quantized phonon conductance than the below-0.8 K temperature required for prior studies of silicon nitride nanobeams. If successful, the proposed measurements of SWCNTs will establish an experimental capability for detecting and controlling quantized phonon transport behaviors of low-dimensional systems. This capability is expected to advance the frontier of experimental research in a foundational area of condensed matter physics.

Learning and Engineering Quantum Many-Body Dynamics,"Emerging quantum technologies require us to control large many-body systems and to maintain their quantum coherence during the dynamics. This would enable achieving quantum advantage in computation and simulation, opening the possibility to tackle complex computational problems of broad practical importance that are out of reach today. Despite rapid progress, there are still limits to the size and coherence time of quantum systems. A fundamental question with broad practical implications is then how to find robust control protocols that can protect the quantum systems, preserving its coherence and entanglement that enable quantum advantage, while also implementing desired dynamics for quantum computation and simulation. Understanding these limits also requires a precise characterization of many-body quantum systems, which is itself a challenging task. This project aims to tackle these two intertwined challenges by developing and studying experimentally novel control and learning protocols. This team will exploit Floquet Hamiltonian engineering to develop novel protocols both analytically and numerically and introduce robust error correction in Hamiltonian engineering. They will further exploit their large-scale, solid-state nuclear spin platforms to experimentally assess the methods and the quantum simulation performance, beyond the regime where classical numerical computation can validate quantum simulations. To evaluate both the control performance and the engineered Hamiltonian, the team will devise experimentally accessible metrics that can characterize the many-body dynamics and the properties of out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum states. In particular, the team will combine novel ideas in quantum system learning with the team's recently demonstrated single-spin correlation measurements and out-of-time ordered commutators to efficiently extract information from the quantum many-body system, even in the presence of a limited number of observables. The results are expected provide novel insight into thermalization and information scrambling – or their absence due to localization or prethermalization, a key question in the quest to exploit many-body systems for quantum applications.

Astronomy Technology and Cutting-Edge Science with HIRAX: Precision Beam Calibration,"Cosmology has undergone tremendous changes over the past decades, with an exponential growth of observational results that have allowed us to build a very precise model of what happened over the last 13.8 billion years, from the big bang until today. This development has gone hand-in-hand with technological progress that has enabled the observation of the Universe during different stages in its evolution, and the analysis of the resulting data. This revolution in observations is still ongoing, and one of the most data intensive fields in the coming decades will be radio astronomy where new, huge telescopes will deliver incredible amounts of data, that however require powerful analysis techniques in order to extract valid scientific results. These results are desperately needed to convert our precise models of the Universe into an improved understanding of the fundamental physical principles that govern the cosmological behaviour on the largest scales.One of the upcoming radio telescopes is HIRAX, the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment, a South African led project with significant Swiss contributions that has led to an active and successful collaboration between the two countries. HIRAX will map baryon acoustic oscillations in the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas over a significant fraction of the sky between redshifts 0.8 and 2.5. HIRAX will be situated in one of the most radio-quiet locations on Earth, the SKA South Africa site in the Karoo desert. However, in order to fully exploit the HIRAX data, we need to also understand the instrumental response to exquisite precision. The diffuse synchrotron emission from our galaxy or from bright extragalactic sources is many orders of magnitude larger than the cosmological  signal. It will be critical for HIRAX to understand the spectral response of the instrument well enough to avoid contamination of the cosmological signal from spectrally smooth foreground sources.  The goal of this proposal is to tackle precisely this challenge, leveraging the successful Swiss - South African collaboration to develop an integrated beam model for the HIRAX telescope, using a variety of scientific and engineering techniques. We will draw on the skills and expertise of South African and Swiss researchers at all levels, both students and staff, to combine a range of approaches, from beam measurements and associated analysis techniques, to beam simulations and beam model fitting. In addition to the scientific results that we expect from the project, this will also lead to more exchanges between the two communities, and to the training of young scientists in cutting-edge fields in science and technology. The detailed aims of the proposal are   * Implementation and coordination of beam calibration techniques   * Development of a simulation and modelling pipeline focused on beam calibration   * Development of an integrated instrument beam model   * Development of a beam calibration strategyThe results from this work will be instrumental for the success of the HIRAX telescope.",422682,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; South Africa; South Africa; Switzerland; South Africa,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
Collaborative Research: Polarimetric Asteroseismology of Massive Hot Stars,"Massive hot stars are the greatest sources of energy and new material in the Galaxy. A collaboration of astronomers at the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy (MIRA), Florida Gulf Coast University, The SETI Institute, the University of Maryland Baltimore County, and the University of Wisconsin Madison, along with their international partners aim to determine the interior structures of these stars by the application of a new technique: polarimetric asteroseismology. Seismic waves bounce around the interiors of stars disturbing their surfaces as if in a perpetual star-quake. The collaboration will make observations of this phenomenon in key stars in tandem with ground- and space-based telescopes (including the NASA TESS mission). A new network of the World's most sensitive polarimeters, spanning a third of the Earth will be used to detect the surface oscillations caused by these seismic waves. The team will also build on established code to develop sophisticated new computer models to interpret the multi-faceted data. College undergraduate and high school students, including some from traditionally under-represented groups, will assist with the project and gain their first hands-on experience of observational astronomy and modeling. Citizen scientists will also be involved, and the project will form part of MIRA's public education programs. A very extensive data set will allow the team to determine the interior structures of about 10 beta Cephei and Slowly Pulsating B-type stars in various stages of evolution. This will be enabled by a large-scale coordinated high-precision polarimetric observing campaign. To achieve the needed phase coverage, it will involve multiple observatories, all equipped with state-of-the-art PICSARR polarimeters. To obtain the necessary S/N and frequency resolution (which depends on temporal baseline) will require many thousands of new polarimetric observations spanning more than 2 years, matched to corresponding photometry and spectroscopy – including new and archival data. The observations will be followed by an intensive multi-part analysis involving sophisticated radiative transfer modeling. Integral to the work is the creation of a new software program that combines pulsating star and polarized radiative transfer codes to properly account for the significant effects of rotation.

Microlocal Analysis and Hyperbolic Dynamics,"This project investigates a broad range of topics at the intersection of microlocal analysis and hyperbolic dynamics. Microlocal analysis, with its roots in physical phenomena such as geometric optics and quantum/classical correspondence, is a powerful mathematical theory relating classical Hamiltonian dynamics to singularities of waves and quantum states. Hyperbolic dynamics is the mathematical theory of strongly chaotic systems, where a small perturbation of the initial data leads to exponentially divergent trajectories after a long time. The project takes advantage of the interplay between these two fields, studying the behavior of waves and quantum states in situations where the underlying dynamics is strongly chaotic, and also exploring the applications of microlocal methods to purely dynamical questions. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. One direction of this project is in the highly active field of quantum chaos, the study of spectral properties of quantum systems where the underlying classical system has chaotic behavior. The Principal Investigator (PI) has introduced new methods in the field coming from harmonic analysis, fractal geometry, additive combinatorics, and Ratner theory, combined together in the concept of fractal uncertainty principle. The specific goals of the project include: (1) understanding the macroscopic concentration of high energy eigenfunctions of closed chaotic systems, such as negatively curved Riemannian manifolds and quantum cat maps; and (2) proving essential spectral gaps (implying in particular exponential local energy decay of waves) for open systems with fractal hyperbolic trapped sets. A second research direction is the study of forced waves in stratified fluids (with similar problems appearing also for rotating fluids), motivated by experimentally observed internal waves in aquaria and by applications to oceanography. A third direction is to apply microlocal methods originally developed for the theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations to study classical objects such as dynamical zeta functions, which is a rare example of the reversal of quantum/classical correspondence. In particular, the PI and his collaborators study (1) how the special values of the dynamical zeta function for a negatively curved manifold relate to the topology of the manifold; and (2) whether dynamical zeta functions can be meromorphically continued for systems with singularities such as dispersive billiards.

The Emergence of Star Clusters: Insights from Artificial Intelligence,"Galaxies transform gas into stars in a process known as star formation. Stars are most often born in clusters. Stellar Clusters can contain thousands of stars and are the main product of star formation in galaxies. The process of forming stars can last for millions of years. The investigators will observe a large number Stellar Clusters in nearby galaxies, with the goal of accurately estimating the time it takes for these Clusters to form. By comparing the environments of star formation with the estimated times of formation, the team will better explain the key physical mechanisms of star formation. To achieve this goal, the team will analyze data of nearby galaxies from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and from the James Webb Space Telescope. The team will also integrate research experiences for teachers from local schools into the project. The teachers will be guided in creating science educational modules, which they will bring back to their classrooms. The aim is to inspire students from minority-dominated school districts into pursuing STEM careers. Molecular gas maps from ALMA and multi-wavelength images from JWST will yield thousands of gas clouds and dusty young star clusters, with their physical parameters, for a sample of 13 galaxies within the local 12 Mpc. A new Artificial Intelligence framework, “AI with Humans in the Loop”, will be employed to search for and label the young clusters, decreasing the effort for these tasks by 50-fold, thus providing a game-changing capability. The large collections of clouds and star clusters will be used to measure the timescales for clearing the natal gas and establish the nature of the feedback mechanism mostly responsible for the clearing. The range of physical parameters probed will enable the team to determine whether the timescales, and their physical origin, depend on cluster mass and/or gas pressure. The results from this project will inform models and simulations of galaxy evolution, of the interplay between galaxies and their surrounding medium, and of the conditions that enable galaxies to leak ionizing photons into the interstellar and intergalactic media.

Free Information Theory Techniques in von Neumann Algebras,"Von Neumann algebras arose in the 1930s as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics it is possible to simultaneously observe and measure various properties of a physical system — for example, the locations and velocities of all of its components. Such properties are often called observables. Observables be viewed as functions of the underlying system and form an algebra — they can be added and multiplied. In quantum mechanics, simultaneous measurements are no longer possible. Mathematically this is reflected by the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables for quantum systems. Nonetheless, many of the operations that can be done with ordinary functions have quantum analogs. The current proposal studies such non-commutative algebras of observables from the angle of Voiculescu’s free probability theory, which treats observables as random variables. This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations and Brownian motion, amenable to analysis by techniques inspired by classical information theory. This project will promote human resource development through graduate and undergraduate research opportunities and will support students under the auspices of the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle. The proposed research deals with several questions in von Neumann algebras which are approached by free probability and free information methods, including free entropy theory. This includes further developing PDE based methods in the non-commutative context and strengthening the connection between free probability and random matrix theory. Among the research directions is a notion of dimension that is based on the behavior of optimal transportation distance, as well as applications of free information theory techniques to von Neumann algebra theory. The project includes a mixture of problems, some coming from existing research directions and some exploring new lines of inquiry.

Searching for the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Advanced LIGO,"Stochastic gravitational-wave background arises as a superposition of many gravitational wave signals generated by uncorrelated astrophysical and cosmological sources throughout the universe. Measuring the astrophysical component of this background, for example, due to mergers of black holes and/or neutron stars, would provide information about how the Universe's large-scale structure formed. Similarly, measuring the cosmological component of this background would provide unique information about the Universe when it was a fraction of a second old, and about the physical laws that apply to very high energy scales that are not reproducible in laboratories. This project aims to search and detect the stochastic gravitational wave background using data from the ground-based gravitational wave detectors Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra. The results of the searches will be used to characterize the composition of the stochastic gravitational wave background and to identify implications for different astrophysical and cosmological models. The project will enable the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in frontier research, and it will promote gravitational-wave science to the general public. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) arises as an incoherent superposition of many gravitational wave signals generated by uncorrelated astrophysical or cosmological sources throughout the universe. This project aims to search for and detect the SGWB using data from the upcoming observing runs of ground-based detectors NSF's Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA. Specifically, data will come from the fourth observing run (O4) which will be completed in early 2025, and from the fifth observing run which is expected to start in 2026/2027. Two search techniques will be used. First, the traditional cross-correlation based search is expected to be 10-40 times more sensitive than the most recent results based on the first three observation runs. Second, for the specific case of the SGWB due to binary black hole mergers, the full Bayesian Search will be developed with the potential to improve the sensitivity by ~1000 times relative to the cross-correlation search. Both searches will be sensitive to the high-redshift population of the compact binary systems, complementing the individual binary merger observations and illuminating the formation and evolution of the binaries. They will also constrain cosmological SGWB models (such as models of inflation, phase transitions, and cosmic string models) and therefore probe the physics of fundamental interactions at very high energies, unachievable in laboratories. Both searches will also estimate the directional content (i.e. anisotropy) of the SGWB, hence providing additional means for distinguishing between different models contributing to the SGWB. The project will offer numerous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to pursue frontier research, leveraging multiple existing programs to foster the involvement of students from underrepresented backgrounds. The project will also support a series of activities designed to bring the excitement of gravitational-wave science to broad communities in the Twin Cities and Minnesota, including public lectures, physics demonstrations, and presentations in K-12 schools, and others.

BSM-PM: Measuring Gravity at the Micron-Scale with Optically Levitated Particles: a Renewal Proposal,"Gravity is the least well understood force in Nature. Its weakness when compared to the other three Standard Model forces makes gravity particularly challenging to measure precisely in laboratory experiments. There have been several predictions from theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, including string theory and supersymmetry, that the Newtonian gravitational inverse square law will break down at some distance below the millimeter scale. In this project, a novel method to test these theories is being developed, which involves using the radiation pressure from a laser beam to suspend and laser cool the motion of a tiny glass bead that serves as a gravitational test mass. When surrounded by a high-vacuum environment the glass bead experiences very little friction and becomes an ultra-sensitive force detector. By introducing a microfabricated silicon and gold source mass near the bead the resulting displacement of the bead can be observed to measure the gravitational attraction between the bead, i.e. test mass, and the source mass. The method is predicted to improve the search for corrections to the gravitational inverse square law at the micron length scale by more than three orders of magnitude. Two graduate students will be broadly trained in experimental physics and nanofabrication. By participating in this highly interdisciplinary research project, students will be well equipped for scientific careers, and efforts to include researchers from under-represented groups will be undertaken. The fundamental nature of this project can instill a sense of wonder about the natural world in the general public. The nation will benefit from an improved understanding of the high-energy physics related to gravitational physics at the micron length scale, at a fraction of the cost of particle-collider experiments. In this project, an experiment will continue to be developed that makes use of laser-cooled trapped nanospheres to test for Yukawa-type deviations from Newtonian gravity at the micron length scale. Previous results include achieving calibrated zeptonewton-level force sensitivity with optically trapped nanospheres, developing novel techniques to maneuver nanospheres within few-micron distances from a source mass surface, demonstrating interferometric methods for metrology of the distance between the test and source masses, and characterization of several background vibrational and electromagnetic noise sources. This next phase of the project involves (1) a continued investigation of noise sources and systematic errors in preliminary gravity measurements, with a goal of acquiring 10^6 seconds of integrated data in a dedicated Yukawa-force search at the 1-2 micron length scale, and (2) in-parallel development of novel methods for trapping and cooling the levitated nanoparticles, including sympathetic cooling with cold atoms. These new techniques can advance the understanding of gravity at the micron length scale by over three orders of magnitude and may lead to ground-breaking discoveries.

Density Functional Theory of Electronic Structure,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry contribute funds to this award that supports theoretical research, computation, and education to develop more accurate computer modeling of molecules, chemicals, and materials. To do this, the PI will focus on the “glue” that binds one atom to another to form molecules and materials: the exchange-correlation energy. In this research, the PI will develop even more accurate approximations for this “glue” that still permit efficient simulation on computers. Kohn-Sham density functional theory is widely used in physics, chemistry, and materials science to predict what atoms, molecules, and materials can exist and with what properties. Starting from the first principles of quantum mechanics, this theory constructs the ground-state energy and electron density of a many-electron system from an auxiliary system of non-interacting electrons including the contribution from the ""glue"", facilitating practical computation. The exact exchange-correlation energy must be approximated. Widely predictive approximations should themselves be based upon first principles, and be accurate enough to predict the small energy differences between competing states in complex materials and systems. The strategy of this project is to achieve more accurate but computable general-purpose approximations by incorporating more of the mathematical properties of the exact universal density functional for the exchange-correlation energy, i.e., by satisfying more exact constraints, by fitting to more appropriate systems in which the approximation can be either exact or highly accurate, and by carefully testing and validating the new approximations over a wide range of systems. Long-term practical benefits to society could include new medicines, chemicals, materials or devices. This research program educates graduate students and more advanced researchers as developers, validators, and users of density functional and electronic structure theory. It will furthermore engage undergraduates and high-school students in the excitement of scientific discovery. The PI will also work with TUteach students and administrators along with other interested individuals in Temple Physics, to organize an annual High School Physics Day at Temple which would be focused on invited high school physics teachers. TECHNICAL SUMMARY The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry contribute funds to this award that supports theoretical research, computation, and education to develop more accurate and predictive density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy, while retaining the advantage of relative computational efficiency. These functionals will be designed to satisfy the known exact constraints on the exact functional. A smoother and more perfected version of the SCAN (strongly constrained and appropriately normed) meta-generalized gradient approximation will be developed, using as appropriate norms not only the uniform electron gas but also many real atoms. Also, the PI aims to continue developing a generalized Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction to the improved SCAN that should be exact for all one-electron densities without losing accuracy for many-electron densities. These advanced functionals will be tested on the many systems for which SCAN has succeeded, including liquid water, structural energy differences in solids, artificial molecules, and the high-temperature superconducting materials, and on the few for which it is known to fail, such as some bulk transition metals and alloys, as well as on additional complex or strongly-correlated systems. Improvements to long-range van der Waals corrections, and a self-interaction correction to the random phase approximation, will also be made and validated. Understanding what makes a functional predictive should guide the burgeoning effort to develop density functional approximations by machine learning. The intellectual merit of the proposal is that many known mathematical properties of the exact functional should make the resulting approximate functionals widely and accurately predictive, at reasonable computational cost, and thus make them useful for many applications, not only for the simpler molecules and materials for which density functionals are already reliable, but also for the more complex or strongly-correlated ones. In particular improved functionals are critically needed for high-throughput searches for new materials with desired properties. The small energy differences between different states can make a complex material easy to switch under human control from one state and functionality to another.

Developing doped ferroelectrics for ultracompact and energy-efficient photonic applications,"Nontechnical abstract: Using light and optics to transmit and process data is foundational to the modern information technology age. This project aims to develop cutting-edge materials systems that can be implemented in state-of-the-art optical information processing platforms, such as for highly efficient lasers and low-energy consumption optical circuits. Key to the project is the application of novel synthesis and characterization techniques to design and fabricate these enabling materials systems, advancing the goals of future manufacturing. The broader research impact addresses the critical need for advanced integrated photonic devices that offer superior performance, such as low optical loss, high speed, and low energy consumption. In addition, this project provides opportunities for research training for graduate and undergraduate students and for post-baccalaureate participants who gain experience in research in a professional laboratory setting through interactions at the university and with national laboratories. Technical abstract: This project aims to develop a cutting-edge materials system consisting of rare-earth ions doped into functional polar transition metal oxides for optical and electrooptic applications. The potential for rare-earth ions in dielectric crystals to generate and amplify light in photonic devices has made it a highly promising field of research. This project focuses on unlocking the full potential of optical transitions of rare-earth ions in the perovskite oxide barium titanate, a highly versatile materials platform for a wide range of optical applications. Using novel materials design and state-of-the-art synthesis and characterization techniques to advance future manufacturing processes, this program integrates the versatile functional properties of complex transition metal oxides into photonic integrated circuits. The focus of this study is the erbium ion system hosted by perovskite barium titanate, which combines the optical transitions of erbium with the functional benefits of barium titanate, including low insertion loss, electrically switchable birefringence, non-linear optical properties, and compatibility with conventional semiconductor substrates. The research addresses fundamental questions surrounding the impact of crystal phase and orientation, structural and stoichiometric defects, and dimensionality of the host barium titanate crystal on the optical transitions of rare-earth erbium, while also investigating the effect of erbium doping on the linear and higher order electric susceptibilities, refractive index, and electrooptic response of barium titanate. Achieving this goal requires atomic-precision synthesis of erbium doped barium titanate thin films and modification of the chemical and structural properties through epitaxial strain and interface effects to improve their functional properties for classical photonic applications. The resulting properties will be comprehensively characterized using state-of-the-art synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopic measurements, and their impact on optical and electro-optical properties will be measured through photoluminescence spectroscopy. The goals of the project are to provide valuable insights for designing cutting-edge photonic devices, such as highly efficient solid-state lasers, non-linear frequency conversion devices, and active optical waveguides and isolators based on the barium titanate platform. In combination with the established versatility of barium titanate in photonic devices, this project paves the way for further integration of barium titanate into materials platforms for ultracompact, low-energy consumption integrated photonic circuits.

The many-body problem in the age of quantum machine learning,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY The study of exotic phases of matter of quantum origin is one of the cornerstones of modern condensed matter physics, motivating a quest for materials and models that could exhibit novel unconventional properties that can find application beyond the semiconductor paradigm. However, understanding correlated quantum systems requires dealing with a large configuration space: datasets are comprised of all possible electronic configurations and cannot be stored in the memory of the largest supercomputer. Hence, the many-body problem can be interpreted as an “extreme data science'' problem from an information processing perspective. Since the advent of high-temperature superconductivity, progress has been marked by ingenuity to overcome the computational limitations of the time. A game-changing idea consists of identifying patterns and compressing datasets in a spirit very similar to algorithms to compress images and videos. Since 2018, we have witnessed the emergence of a novel line of research now referred-to as “quantum machine learning” that uses neural networks and machine-learning algorithms to extract insightful information and represent the complex entanglement structure encoded in quantum wave-functions. Due to their underlying complexity, these problems are theoretically very challenging, but amenable to numerical methods. Therefore, the focus of the research will be computational in nature and will also involve the development of new innovative algorithms based on quantum information and machine learning ideas. As a result, new tools for scientific discovery will be developed that may be applicable to other disciplines beyond condensed matter physics, including nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. Beyond training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, the PI will partner with institutional outreach programs to provide courses and lectures to middle- and high-school teachers, and will participate in the Bridge to Physics program that aims to empower children from Boston’s underserved communities to succeed in advanced math classes. TECHNICAL SUMMARY Since the advent of high-temperature superconductivity, progress has been marked by ingenuity to overcome the computational limitations imposed by hardware.

RUI: Using fIREBAll to Study Rare-Earth Nuclei,"Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter, and the understanding of their fundamental properties has been the goal of nuclear physics for decades. This award will support studies aimed at understanding the rotation and vibration of deformed nuclei using the La Crosse fIREBAll, a newly developed detector array at the University of Notre Dame to measure unique properties of rare-earth nuclei. Undergraduate students from the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse will be involved in every step of this project from experimental design to the broad dissemination of the results through published work and presentations at workshops and conferences. In addition, this project will inform the public through the podcast, My Nuclear Life which explores the intersection of nuclear science and society. Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter and the understanding of their fundamental properties is the main goal of this award. Nuclei show some emergent collective behavior across isotopic and isobaric chains and are known to be deformed in shape in regions of the chart of nuclides away from closed shells. The existence of vibrational degrees of freedom superimposed on rotational states addresses a degree of freedom in nuclei and is one of the open questions in nuclear structure physics today. The intellectual merit of this project lies in investigating the vibrational degrees of freedom superimposed on the deformed ground states and the expected rotational excited states built upon them. The investigators aim to determine the characteristics of excited states by the measurement of conversion electrons in coincidence with gamma rays using the only array of its kind in the US. This project will use the newly commissioned La Crosse fIREBAll detector located at the University of Notre Dame's (ND) Nuclear Science Laboratory and multiple (alpha,2n) reactions to measure conversion electrons in rare-earth nuclei. From these experiments, extracted electron conversion coefficients will be used to calculated transition probabilities of interested levels. Analyses will be performed at the Institute for Structure & Nuclear Astrophysics at ND during the summer months and the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL) during the academic year. Additional research activities at UWL will include detector training for students, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. All experiments will be performed, analyzed, and disseminated in collaboration with UWL undergraduate students. As such, this work exemplifies the recommendation made in the 2023 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science, to capitalize on the unique ways in which nuclear science can advance discovery by investing in a small-scale project at NSF-funded laboratory which increases the potential for discovery and will also train the next generation of nuclear scientists to meet societal needs.

Collaborative Research: Reconstructing Primordial Density Fluctuations using Near-Field Cosmology,"Faint dwarf galaxies are sensitive to dark matter and early universe physics. The investigators will develop a model that comprehensively predicts the population of dwarf galaxies surrounding the Milky Way as a function of dark matter properties and early universe dynamics. Comparing these predictions to the data will yield constraints on dark matter particle models and cosmic inflation. The key product of this work is an efficient and accurate model for the Milky Way’s dwarf galaxy population in non-standard cosmologies. This work will train early career researchers in broadly-applicable computational methods and support undergraduates from underrepresented groups in physics through the National Society of Black Physicists and Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science programs. Dwarf galaxies occupy the smallest dark matter halos that can form stars. These systems are extremely sensitive to unknown dark matter and early universe physics. To date, the faintest dwarf galaxies have exclusively been detected as satellites of the Milky Way. This situation presents a theoretical challenge: to discover fundamental physics in these data, we must model the specific formation history of our Galaxy’s dark matter halo and satellite population. The investigators will perform new suites of cosmological simulations constrained to match the Milky Way, with initial conditions appropriate for a variety of dark matter and early-universe scenarios, which will be used to calibrate the Galacticus galaxy formation model. The calibrated model, Galacticus-MW, will rapidly and accurately predict the Milky Way satellite population as a function of the beyond-CDM linear matter power spectrum. Comparing these predictions to the data will yield the first near-field measurement of small-scale matter clustering, along with constraints on dark matter properties (including its particle mass, interactions, and production mechanism) and on cosmic inflation. This work will enable cosmological inference using dwarf galaxy populations detected by Stage IV surveys over the next decade.

BSM-PM: Comprehensive Theoretical Modeling of Novel Molecular Sensor Based on Ultracold 223FrAg Molecules in Search for CP-violating Forces,"The PI and her research team will theoretically model an extremely powerful new platform to study novel symmetry-violating forces beyond those in the Standard Model of particle physics. The study of these phenomena is needed to explain the observed cosmological asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Priority in the proposed research will be given to a platform based on milli-Kelvin, trapped 223FrAg, francium-silver molecules, which takes advantage of their enhanced sensitivity to the symmetry-violating effects. The shape or charge distribution of the unstable 223Fr nucleus is octupole deformed (pear-like) promoting increases in sensitivity to symmetry breakdowns. In addition, the electron bonding between Fr and Ag can lead to a strong, effective internal electric field along the axis connecting the two atoms at the positions of the nuclei magnifying the effects of externally applied fields. The research team’s primary goal is to provide guidance to experimental groups for “building” this novel molecular sensor with revolutionary sensitivity to symmetry-violations from its constituent atoms Fr and Ag. Both atoms have already been cooled with lasers to milli-Kelvin temperatures. Binding the two cold atoms together, also using lasers, however, has never been done before and, specifically, calculating the rate at which this can be achieved will help determine the success of the sensor. The precise determination of the rates with calculations spearheaded by the students are crucial to advance the field and will be performed in coordination with an experimental group building the apparatus led by Dr. D. DeMille at the University of Chicago. The technical research of the proposal has several components. Firstly, electronic states and radiative transition dipole moments of the FrAg diatomic molecule must be precisely determined. An important element of this proposal is the development of a state-of-the-art relativistic configuration-interaction valence-bond method for precise first-principle numerical calculations of di-atomic molecules. The valence-bond method is unique among molecular electronic structure methods as it is well suited for the larger internuclear separations, where the overlap of the electron wavefunction of the two atoms is relatively small. Secondly, the PI and her team will use numerical quantum scattering models to describe the relative motion of the two ultracold atoms in the presence of magnetic fields and laser radiation of multiple colors to assemble FrAg molecules. At cold temperatures molecular forces operating at large interatomic separations dominate the physics of the motion. Resonant scattering phenomena in the presence of a magnetic field can enhance the molecular formation rates. Finally, once FrAg has been formed in its energetically lowest rovibrational state, the research will characterize the light shifts on eigen states of FrAg due to the laser light that traps them. These forces, while essential for the experiment, will also be detrimental for precision measurements looking for small symmetry breaking effects. The light forces are classified as scalar, vector, and tensor light shifts in order of decrease size.

CAREER: New methods in curve counting,"The past thirty years have seen a deep and surprising interplay between several branches in pure mathematics, and string theory in physics. In particular, physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in STEM. More specifically, the project will result in a proof of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the ""conifold gap condition"", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.

Collaborative Research: The Interacting Magellanic Clouds - Excavating the Fossil Evidence,"The question of how galaxies form and change is an extremely complex one. The resolved stars and gas of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy allow us to infer many important aspects of galaxy evolution for larger galaxies. For the more numerous and smaller dwarf galaxies, however, the picture of how they formed and evolved is much less clear. Two exceptions, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (MCs), serve as unique laboratories for observing galaxy evolution processes that occur in low mass galaxies. The investigators will use new observations and existing datasets to map the Magellanic Clouds in a search for the fossil evidence of past interactions of the MCs with one another or with smaller systems they have accreted. The team will will create astronomy lesson plans and resources with the Apsáalooke (Crow) tribe that explore Native and Western science, and they will help deliver the lessons at many outreach events. The team will contribute to a summer STEM research programs at UVa for students at college-level, identified as a primary attrition point in the STEM career path for the URM community. The team will support professional development of early career scientists, including two graduate students and six undergraduates. The investigators will use cutting-edge observational datasets to map the Magellanic Clouds and their periphery and search for the fossil evidence of past interactions of the MCs with one another or with smaller systems they have accreted. By mapping the kinematical and chemical abundance patterns across the Clouds they will look for spatial variations that are benchmarks in their elemental abundance and motions dynamics and/or provide key signatures to the origin of known and potentially new substructures among the stars and gas in the extended periphery of the MCs.

Strengthening Gravitational-Wave and Pulsar Science with the CHIME Telescope,"Radio pulsars – rotating neutron stars with beamed emission observed as periodic radio pulses – are uniquely powerful tools for probing open questions in “fundamental physics.” Such questions that pulsars may answer include: are there gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies, perhaps from the early universe? How does matter behave in the extreme-density environments within neutron stars? Can the effects imprinted on pulsar signals from the interstellar medium (ISM) further probe the environments and properties of neutron stars? A research team at West Virginia University will try to address these and other questions by increasing the capabilities of the NSF-funded North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), which uses observations of millisecond-period radio pulsars as a galaxy-sized detector of gravitational waves (GW). The project will incorporate into NANOGrav data from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. Students working on the project will undertake studies of pulsar timing, ISM, and noise properties that together form the bedrock of a firm NANOGrav detection of GWs. In addition, the investigators will develop a series of open-source, educational activities regarding the searching for and timing of pulsars to help train people interested in pursuing academic study of radio pulsars. The rotational stability of pulsars allows them to serve as precisely-ticking clocks in extreme environments where sub-microsecond-level effects predicted by Einstein’s general relativity can be resolved. Most of the key measurements in gravitational and nuclear astrophysics have come from studying pulsars and their timing properties. The recent evidence for GWs at nanohertz frequencies, recently established by NANOGrav, have shown that the “discovery space” of GW astronomy and neutron-star physics remains largely unexplored. The proposed work leverages these facts in order to build a research program focused on low-frequency GW astronomy and, by the nature of NANOGrav analysis, high-accuracy pulsar science. The resultant studies supported by this grant proposal will: characterize the stability of pulse morphology for all NANOGrav pulsars and thus the noise properties for a GW detection; yield a large number of new neutron-star mass measurements using the maturing framework of scintillation theory; and derive new and unique This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",416409,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
Collaborative Research: Correlated Phases in an Unusual Family of Crystalline 2D Materials,"Non-technical Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been at the focus of condensed matter physics, driving the exploration of fundamental principles, novel quantum matter, and advanced functional devices. The moiré superlattices of 2D semiconductors allow for the emergence of diverse correlated-electron phases within a single device due to advantageous electric gate tunability yet suffers from challenges in achieving spatial inhomogeneity and reproducibility. Remarkably, naturally occurring crystalline multilayer graphene, a family of 2D semiconductors with electric-field tunable band gaps, provide an ideal and highly reproducible platform for studying similarly diverse correlated-electron phases within a single device, eliminating the need for moiré engineering. This project aims to investigate the emergent phenomena, phases, properties, and principles in this unique platform. The anticipated outcomes of this project are expected to benefit society through the research results and outreach initiatives. Its success will also illuminate the transformative potential of ultra-thin low-dissipation quantum chips in advancing next-generation information technology and sustainable energy solutions. Key educational endeavors integrated into the research include: (i) fostering participation from under-represented groups, (ii) mentoring STEM undergraduate students from MIT, UTD, and REU programs, (iii) enhancing existing public outreach and K-12 education by developing demonstration module and lessons on 2D semiconductors. Technical Abstract Built upon the high material quality, electric gate tunability, and presence of strongly interacting electrons within highly reproducible rhombohedral graphene multilayers, this project aims to establish an exceptional platform focused on this distinctive family of crystalline 2D semiconductors. The goal is to investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking, demonstrate novel correlated phases of matter, and provide new insights into fundamental principles governing the intricate interplay between geometry, symmetry, topology, and interaction. This project leverages strong and complementary expertise in both experimental and theoretical domains, fostering an established collaboration. Successful implementation of the project will actualize the potential of rhombohedral graphene semiconductors in discovering, realizing, and optimizing a variety of exotic correlated phases of matter that are rare otherwise. These advancements will not only contribute to new knowledge in correlated electrons and semiconductor physics but may also pave the way for transforming next-generation information technology and sustainable energy solutions, utilizing ultra-thin low-dissipation quantum chips.

Understanding the Stellar Mass and Environmental Dependences of Cosmic Black-Hole Growth,"The PIs will utilize a large sample of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) to study the long-term growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH). This research program will help astronomers better understand the connections between the SMBH and their host galaxies and extended environment. This program will also support an annual series of summer workshops, which help Pennsylvania high-school and middle-school teachers better educate their students about, black holes, cosmology, stars, and the scientific method. Teachers from underserved school districts will be recruited and provided with scholarship funds. Pencil-beam and wider field multiwavelength surveys are now making it possible to study, over almost the full span of cosmic history, the relations between long-term SMBH growth and host-galaxy properties/environment. The PI will investigate and interpret the links between SMBH growth, host-galaxy properties, and cosmic environment utilizing a sample of 1.3 million well-characterized galaxies/AGNs. They will address the following key questions: (1) What do relations between SMBH growth, host stellar mass, and redshift imply about SMBH/galaxy coevolution? (2) How does SMBH growth depend upon cosmic environment in rich, high-redshift structures? New data from, e.g., the Rubin LSST Deep-Drilling Fields and the VLT MOONS spectrograph will be critical in answering these questions. Large-scale structures, including clusters/protoclusters, will soon be mapped by intensive spectroscopic surveys. This will allow rigorous, systematic investigations of the dependence of SMBH accretion rate upon environment in rich, high-redshift structures where more-limited targeted studies indicate enhancements in SMBH growth. The Pis will also study the locations of AGNs within clusters/protoclusters for insights into feedback and quenching, and they will assess AGN obscuration levels to search for rapid, hidden phases of SMBH growth.

Coatings for Next Generation Gravitational Wave Interferometers,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. Since 2015, when the twin NSF's LIGO gravitational wave detectors (GWD) in the United States detected the first signals originating from the coalescence of two massive black holes, there have been multiple detections at a pace of about one a week. Presently in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observation campaign, detections are revealing new mergers with unexpected results. Key to these remarkable achievements has been the improvements in the sensitivity of GWD, among which the reduction in the coating thermal noise (CTN) of the test masses of the interferometer has had a large impact. The projected 2x reduction in CTN with respect to the current LIGO coatings and beyond for third-generation (3G) GWD is pushing the scientific and engineering boundaries in dielectric coatings to understand and control the fundamental mechanisms in amorphous oxides that contribute to mechanical loss. The project aims to demonstrate next-generation multilayer dielectric coatings that reduce the thermal noise by a factor of two and pave the way to identify strategies to further reduce CTN for 3G GWDs. Toward this goal, new amorphous oxide mixtures will be investigated for their potential to reduce CTN when incorporated into mirror coating stacks. The proposed research on amorphous thin films by ion beam sputtering supports the projected development of GWDs. The fundamental materials and coating design aspects of the project will have a broad impact as near-infrared dielectric coatings are ubiquitous in ultra-stable optical cavities and other laser systems. The know-how to be developed is translational, as the deposition method and equipment we will use are standard in the coatings industry. The proposed research will offer a diverse group of students at all levels multiple opportunities to gain an in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms that affect internal friction in amorphous materials that are the backbone of interference coatings for ultra-high finesse optical cavities and at the same time gain valuable expertise in optical sciences. This interdisciplinary research project will train students in STEM areas, to contribute to advancing science and technology in academic, national laboratory, and industrial settings.

Nanostructured materials for tailored magnon-spin qubit interactions,"Nontechnical abstract: Quantum bits or ‘qubits’ are the building blocks of quantum technologies for sensing, networking, communication, and computing. One promising platform for implementing a qubit is as an individual atomic defect in diamond, known as a nitrogen-vacancy center. The magnetic property of these defects – the spin – has robust quantum coherence, even at room temperature. Already, these defect spin qubits have found application as versatile quantum sensors in a solid-state platform. However, one of the most significant challenges facing this qubit platform is the lack of an efficient, scalable means to address and couple high density arrays of multiple qubits. Most significantly, controlled coupling between qubits is essential to realize the true promise of quantum technology through quantum entanglement. This project is working to forge a path to overcome this challenge, using nanometer-scale magnetic structures to provide strong, local, controllable magnetic fringe fields for addressing and coupling spin qubits. A primary challenge is that the same features that make a magnetic material or structure desirable often also lead to increased magnetic field noise that causes degraded qubit performance. This project is working to understand this trade-off of coupling for enhanced functionality vs. degraded coherence, and how materials and structures can be designed to optimize that trade-off. Success of this work will enable a pathway towards new solid state, room-temperature quantum technology. In doing so, a diverse cohort of students will be trained for the quantum and semiconductor workforce. Technical abstract: The hypothesis underlying this work is that there exist magnetic nanostructures whose magnetization state and magnetic excitations can be used to address and couple proximal defect spin qubits, without introducing excessive qubit decoherence. To test this hypothesis, we are working to better understand the phenomena by which magnetic nanostructures induce decoherence in a proximal spin qubit. The research team is using nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond coupled to permalloy magnetic disks, magnetized into a vortex state, as a flexible test-bed system. With knowledge gained from this test-bed system, other materials and structures are being explored to optimize addressability and coupling vs. decoherence. For example, materials with different Gilbert damping coefficient have different magnetic noise characteristics due to the fluctuation dissipation theorem, and different nano-structures allow tuning of magnetic fringe fields and the spectrum of magnetic excitations. In particular, artificial spin ice structures provide a magnetic metamaterial platform with rich opportunities for tailoring fringe fields and magnon dynamics. Addressing the hypothesis above also requires defining the thresholds for necessary qubit addressability and coupling vs. sufficient qubit coherence. To do this, the research team is developing benchmark figures of merit for proposed applications for defect qubit entanglement.

Quantum Spin-Optomechanics of a Nanodiamond in an Ion Trap in High Vacuum,"As raising the energy of particle accelerators for new physics becomes increasingly challenging, precision measurements emerge as a promising alternative to address fundamental physics questions. This research project aims to develop an extraordinarily sensitive spin-optomechanical system for studying fundamental questions in physics, such as the limits of quantum mechanics and the nature of quantum gravity. The research team will levitate rapidly rotating nanodiamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in high vacuum, and use them to investigate coherent dynamics and geometric phases, which are accumulated during rotation along a trajectory. This may potentially lead to the development of a nanodiamond matter-wave interferometer. This breakthrough could significantly advance precision measurements and topological physics. The project also includes a strong commitment to education and outreach, involving collaboration with industry in practical applications of quantum sensing, and integrating findings into academic curricula for training undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, the PI and graduate students will engage the public through outreach events such as the ""Quantum Open House"" at Purdue University. In this project, the research team will directly load and trap nanodiamonds in high vacuum using an integrated surface ion trap, and explore quantum spin-optomechanical interactions between the motion of a levitated nanodiamond and its internal NV electron spin qubits for creating a nanodiamond matter-wave interferometer. The research team will systematically investigate the coherent dynamics and geometric phases of electron spin qubits in rapidly rotating nanodiamonds and using single electron spins to control the motion of these levitated nanodiamonds. Additionally, the research team will enhance spin coherence through rapid rotation and dynamical decoupling, which will contribute to the development of a nanodiamond matter-wave interferometer. This research also promises significant advancements in quantum sensing technologies using spin defects for potential practical applications in various fields.

NSF-GACR: Multi-wavelength studies of nearby ram pressure stripped galaxies,"Galaxies transform and evolve with time depending on two key factors, the galaxy mass and the environment where the galaxy resides. As galaxies speed through galaxy clusters and groups, they often leave behind long tails of gas behind them. This project will study the stripped tails trailing behind galaxies with multi-wavelength data recently collected from world-class telescopes. The investigators will study gas at different phases, examine their connection, compare with numerical simulations, and advance our understanding of galaxy evolution and the multi-phase medium. Students will be trained in how to conduct scientific research. The team will also engage with high school students from underrepresented minorities in northern Alabama. All relevant scientific results will be shared with the public. Energy balance and transfer in a multi-phase medium is an outstanding question in astrophysics, important for cosmic structure formation. This research team focuses on a new kind of multi-phase medium, stripped tails of cluster late-type galaxies. Ram pressure stripping is a common process in astrophysics and an important ingredient in galaxy evolution. The PI will take advantage of a large amount of multi-wavelength data, in particular new data obtained under an ALMA large program, to study the multiphase tails of late-type galaxies experiencing ram pressure stripping. The PI will also study the morphology and kinematics of these tidal tails. The key factors to govern star formation in tails will be examined. The effect of ram pressure stripping on star formation and nuclear activity of galaxies will also be studied. This research will result in an enhanced understanding of mixing and heating/cooling in multi-phase medium, star formation efficiency in stripped tails, impact of ram pressure stripping on galaxy properties. The Principal Investigator will lead workshops for under-represented minority students in local high schools and other efforts to improve astronomical and science education in the local community.

Magnetospheric Accretion Around Magnetized Stars,"Magnetospheric accretion, where mass from surrounding disks is channeled onto the central objects by their magnetic fields, plays a key role in the formation and evolution of a wide range of astrophysical objects – including neutron stars, young stars, and even planets. The investigators will use advanced supercomputing resources to conduct first-principle numerical simulations of magnetospheric accretion. They will study how neutron stars produce X-ray pulsars and Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (PULXs), and how young stars and planets evolve within their environments.

Strong-Coupling Phenomena at the Metal-Insulator Transition,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY Modern technology often requires fine-tuning of electronic properties of conductors close to the insulating state–-the metal-insulator transition region. Experimental progress in the last few years have made this regime accessible, with the discovery of new quantum materials and devices, producing a veritable avalanche of yet-unexplained experimental data. In the next three years, the PI will develop novel theoretical approaches that will provide the necessary tools to understand these phenomena, which are being realized in systems ranging from molecular organic materials to various devices made from stacking two-dimensional sheets of materials. Here, the electron-electron interactions in presence of materials disorder dramatically modify the energy landscape in which the electrons travel, sometimes disrupting their ability to move within the conductor. The ability to theoretically describe such situations will open new avenues for the design of novel experimental platforms with specific properties required by modern quantum science and engineering. This project will allow training of graduate students in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. The PI will continue to promote and enhance scientific and technological understanding and importance of our research to the general public through various outreach activities: 1) Presentation of lectures at local schools and acting as a judge at regional science fairs; 2) Participating in the Florida State University Physics Department Open House activities and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory annual Open House activities. The PI has been invited to act as, and will assume the role of, faculty advisor of a grass-roots undergraduate student organization named ""The Future Physicist Society at FSU"". This will provide an effective avenue to assist the students in taking the next career step after leaving FSU. TECHNICAL SUMMARY In the following three years, the PI will theoretically examine several fundamental aspects of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) on several new experimental platforms, including Mott organic systems, various moiré bilayers devices, as well as two-dimensional quantum meta-materials based on ion implantation in semiconductors. Here, several distinct MIT regimes will be examined and theoretically described, where different physical mechanisms dominate, as follows: A) A theory of disorder-dominated MITs (away from the Mott regime) will be developed, focusing on the polaronic picture based on a self-consistent (saddle-point) but nonpeturbative approach, allowing, however, systematic corrections, which will also be included; B) Disorder effects will also be examined in the Mott (interaction-dominated), as well as in the related heavy-fermion regimes. Several of these regimes can be accessed and identified experimentally in the same moiré devices, allowing comparative studies and promising a new conceptual understanding of the MIT transition region. This project will allow training of graduate students in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics.

Nonequilibrium quantum mechanics of strongly correlated systems,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research on complex quantum systems that are in a highly excited or nonequilibrium state. One of the main challenges of such systems is that they heat to a high temperature, a situation which is detrimental to observing any non-trivial quantum phenomena. Nevertheless, if the system has some symmetries, this can limit heating. The award will explore how symmetries, and generalizing the notion of symmetries, can lead to phenomena out of equilibrium that are immune to heating. The project will bring together methods from mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter physics with the common goal being to study generalized symmetries, out of equilibrium. One consequence of generalized symmetries is that the quantum system can host objects known as ""non-abelian anyons"". These objects can be used to store memory that is stable for long times. The project will explore how non-abelian anyons can be realized in experimental platforms such as the so-called ""Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum"" devices. The project has a strong educational component as it will involve the active participation of a graduate student, an undergraduate student, and a postdoctoral research scientist. Recent developments in generalized symmetries have brought together concepts from mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, condensed matter, and high energy physics. The PI will adapt her course on theoretical condensed matter physics to introduce students to these recent developments. In addition, the PI and the junior research scientists will broaden participation by mentoring high school students through the NYU-GSTEM program. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research on nonequilibrium phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems. The focus will be twofold. One is to develop methods to study non-abelian excitations, essential for quantum computing, in a highly non-equilibrium setting, realizable in current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The second is to develop methods to study information theoretic measures that quantify how an initial decoherence grows, and entanglement spreads. In the first major thrust, the PI will study Floquet models built out of a fusion category. In these models, the role of topological defects, operators that can be deformed in the space and time direction without changing the physics, will be explored. When the topological defects are invertible, these are unitary symmetries. When the topological defects are non-invertible, these act as projectors, are non-abelian, and are examples of non-invertible symmetries. The latter are also examples of generalized symmetries, and their effect on quantum dynamics will be explored. The Floquet circuits to be studied will include unitary circuits, non-unitary circuits, and dual-unitary circuits, without integrability being a key requirement. When several topological defects are applied to the circuit, creating junctions, its effect on the dynamics will be studied. The implementation of topological defects in NISQ devices will be explored. In the second thrust, the PI will employ an augmented Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to study the space-time propagation of information theoretic measures such as out of time ordered correlators. The goal will be to understand how intrinsic noise can affect propagation of the butterfly front. In addition, how proximity to localization-delocalization transitions affects information propagation will be explored. The project has a strong educational component as it will involve the active participation of a graduate student, an undergraduate student, and a postdoctoral research scientist. Recent developments in generalized symmetries have brought together concepts from mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, condensed matter, and high energy physics. The PI will adapt her course on theoretical condensed matter physics to introduce students to these recent developments. In addition, the PI and the junior research scientists will broaden participation by mentoring high school students through the NYU-GSTEM program.

Hard Scattering Processes in QCD,"Almost all the mass of atoms resides in the nucleons (protons and neutrons) that make up the corresponding atomic nucleus. Nucleons are not elementary particles but rather complicated bound states of quarks and gluons (collectively denoted as partons), whose interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The parton structure of the nucleon is encoded in different parton distributions and quark-gluon correlations. Both parton distributions and quark-gluon correlations can, in principle, be studied through high-energy (hard) scattering processes at particle accelerators, including the future Electron-Ion Collider in the USA. However, for quark-gluon correlations this is very difficult, and therefore these quantities are presently largely unexplored. The first goal of the project is to develop and apply an improved theoretical framework for extracting the nucleon transversity, one of the least explored parton distributions, from data on high-energy processes. Along with that goes a state-of-the-art extraction of the tensor charge, one of the fundamental properties of the nucleon. The second goal is to develop a formalism which allows for the calculation of quark-gluon correlations numerically in QCD, thus circumventing the lack of information from experiment. The project integrates research and teaching of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as educational outreach. The work on the transversity parton distributions and the tensor charge extends our previous studies in this area. A special focus is on enhancing the QCD formalism for the analysis of data on di-hadron production by computing next-to-leading-order perturbative corrections. This framework then serves as a key ingredient of a novel extraction of the transversity and tensor charge of the nucleon, which uses all pertinent data on di-hadron (and single-hadron) production. A major goal of this study is the comparison of the nucleon tensor charge based on experimental data with benchmark results obtained from first-principles calculations in lattice-QCD. The study of the quark-gluon correlations exploits a new class of Euclidean parton correlators that can be computed in lattice-QCD. While these correlators do not directly provide the QCGs of interest, the two types of quantities can be related through calculations in perturbative QCD. Developing the required formalism, which presently is in its infancies, is a key objective of the project. Close interaction is foreseen with researchers performing numerical calculations in lattice-QCD, to ensure that the new theoretical framework can be readily put into practice.

"Minimal Surfaces, Groups and Geometrization","Differential geometry is a field which studies the shape of objects. Of particular importance are shapes that are ""optimal"" under natural constraints. An important class of optimal shapes is given by ""minimal surfaces"": a soap film spanning a metal wire, which tends to minimize its energy, is an example of minimal surface. This type of surfaces appears in many places in physics, but is also of intrinsic interest. The investigator will work on deforming smooth spaces, also called ""manifolds"", into an optimal shape by using the concept of minimal surfaces. Manifolds are ubiquitous in mathematics, and hopefully this approach will give new insights on their possible shapes. This project will moreover support student training and inclusion through seminars, workshops and knowledge dissemination efforts. The notion of ""geometric structure"" serves as a unifying concept in geometry and topology, as exemplified by the Uniformization theorem for surfaces and the Geometrization theorem for 3-manifolds. In those classical instances, geometric structures are essentially defined as homogenous spaces with a geometric discrete group action. In higher dimensions, those geometric structures are very rare, and perhaps too rigid compared to the diversity of closed manifolds. In this project, the investigator proposes to consider a more general and flexible notion: minimal surfaces in (possibly infinite dimensional) homogeneous spaces, invariant under a geometric discrete group action. With this point of view, the investigator will explore a series of questions which relates minimal surfaces to geometric group theory and representation theory. A typical problem is the following: what group can act geometrically on a connected minimal surface in a Hilbert sphere?

Convective Boundary Mixing in Massive Stars,"The biggest stars can produce bright explosions like supernova or collapse into black holes. One important question is whether fresh fuel from the outer part of the star can get mixed into the center of the star, where it could burn, extending the life of the star. Observations of these stars suggest they live longer than might be expected, so some mixing must be occurring in the star. This work will model mixing in massive stars using computer simulations. The simulations will determine what fraction of the star gets mixed. These results will be used to make new predictions of the lifetimes of such stars, and they will be compared to observations. The results will also be used to predict how many supernova and black holes we expect to see. Each summer, this project will support high school students to complete independent research projects supervised by the project team. This award will support the Research Experience in Astronomy at CIERA for High school students program at Northwestern. This is a highly interactive three-week program that provides high school students experience with astronomy research in an atmosphere of team-style learning, hands-on training, and mentorship from professional scientists. Although rare, massive stars are disproportionately important in astrophysics. They are progenitors of neutron stars and black holes, and they chemically enrich their environments through winds and/or mass loss. Accurate stellar and population synthesis models of intermediate- and high-mass stars are required to robustly predict properties of stellar remnants and nucleosynthetic yields. The lives and deaths of these stars are intrinsically linked to mixing that occurs at the boundary of their convective cores. If fresh fuel can mix into the core, it can extend the star’s main-sequence lifetime and alter its subsequent evolution. Constraining convective boundary mixing is essential for accurate and robust neutron star and black hole population synthesis modeling. This investigator will derive convective boundary mixing parameterizations from multi-dimensional numerical simulations. The team will run a suite of three-dimensional global spherical numerical simulations to measure convective penetration. They will determine how convective penetration varies with stellar mass, age, and rotation rate. The parameterization of convective penetration will be implemented in the MESA code, and we will validate it by comparing to asteroseismic observations. Finally, they will use the new parameterization in the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine how our new parameterization affects compact object binary merger rates.

Algebraic Geometry and Strings,"Exploration of the interactions of physical theories (string theory and quantum field theory) with mathematics (especially algebraic geometry) has been extremely productive for decades, and the power of this combination of tools and approaches only seems to strengthen with time. The goal of this project is to explore and push forward some of the major issues at the interface of algebraic geometry with string theory and quantum field theory. The research will employ and combine a variety of techniques from algebraic geometry, topology, integrable systems, String theory, and Quantum Field theory. The project also includes many broader impact activities such as steering and organization of conferences and schools, membership of international boards and prize committees, revising Penn’s graduate program, curricular development at the graduate and undergraduate level, advising postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, editing several public service volumes and editing of journals and proceedings volumes. More specifically, the project includes, among other topics: a QFT-inspired attack on the geometric Langlands conjecture via non-abelian Hodge theory; a mathematical investigation of physical Theories of class S in terms of variations of Hitchin systems; applications of ideas from supergeometry to higher loop calculations in string theory; exploration of moduli questions in algebraic geometry, some of them motivated by a QFT conjecture, others purely within algebraic geometry; further exploration of aspects of F theory and establishment of its mathematical foundations; and exploration of categorical symmetries and defect symmetry TFTs. Each of these specific research areas represents a major open problem in math and/or in physics, whose solution will make a major contribution to the field.

Measurement-Induced Transitions in Dispersive Qubit Readout Schemes,"To make quantum computers practically useful, the underlying building blocks, called qubits, must be protected from the environment so that no errors occur during the computations. The current superconducting qubit technology is limited by the time it takes to check and fix these errors. A major roadblock to improving the performance of superconducting quantum processors comes from the inefficiencies in determining the quantum states of individual qubits because of the tendency of the qubits to leave the intended states during the measurement process. This project focuses on understanding the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the qubit transitions during the measurement process and aims to develop and experimentally verify methods for predicting these transitions in the state-of-the-art superconducting qubits to improve the performance of modern quantum processors and to expand the capabilities of superconducting quantum technologies. The societal benefits of the project include advancing the fundamental understanding of measurements in quantum mechanics and fostering novel design paradigms in the development of quantum devices and sensors. Graduate students working on the project will acquire theoretical and experimental skills essential for long-term economic growth driven by advanced technologies. The error rates required for performing practically useful quantum computations must be significantly below the rates achievable with the currently available physical qubits. Quantum error correction offers a way to effectively reduce error rates by encoding logical qubits within an array of physical qubits. The present-day implementations of the error correction codes with superconducting qubits are largely limited by the time that it takes to readout and reset the qubits used to detect the errors in the remaining part of the circuit. Further progress in shortening the readout time and increasing the measurement fidelity of the widely used dispersive qubit measurement scheme is hindered by the measurement-induced qubit transitions into the out-of-computational space. This project aims to provide a universal framework for systematically identifying the measurement-induced transitions and analyzing the limitations imposed on the dispersive readout by these transitions. The theoretical framework for estimating the maximum number of photons will be experimentally verified in model qubit systems such as transmons and fluxonia. Once verified, it will be applied to optimize the dispersive readout of fluxonium qubits.

CAREER: Multimessenger Astrophysics with Pulsar Timing Arrays in the Detection Era,"The recent announcement by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) and pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world of evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) demonstrates that PTAs are moving into an unprecedented sensitivity regime for gravitational wave (GW) signals in the nanohertz frequency range. PTAs can see further back in time than the cosmic microwave background radiation and allow us to survey the population of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) as a stochastic GWB. Detection of the background heralds the coming of individual source detections just when the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are scheduled to begin obtaining consistent and high quality time series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) --- perfectly timed to coincide with the era of the first single-source detections in the PTA band. GW detections at these frequencies take time and necessitate the use of state-of-the-art data analysis techniques to build custom noise models for individual pulsar data sets in order to enhance the huge investment of the NSF into nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy just as PTAs enter the detection era. As the cosmic symphony of the stochastic GWB becomes more significant in the data, it is now necessary for PTAs to tune these galactic-scale detectors to optimize the ability to also resolve individual SMBBHs. PTAs will arbitrate the SMBBH hypothesis for quasiperiodic light curves in AGN, and this work will maximize the multimessenger detectability space of SMBBH systems by informing PTA and LSST observing strategies in order to ensure the detection of a multimessenger source during the LSST-era. The project includes curriculum development and implementation of a summer workshop in astrophysics-themed data analysis that will foster inspired teaching, stimulate excitement in PTA research, facilitate the learning goals of undergraduate and graduate students, and support the transition of community college students into 4-year schools. The first research goal will be using techniques recently pioneered to transform PTA noise mitigation strategies with the use of custom Bayesian models to gain from the data we already have in hand. Preliminary analyses have shown significant changes in parameter recovery and significance statistics when using these custom models. This work will inform a reconceptualization of the use of detector characterization tools to rethink pulsar observing strategies and the reorganization of these tools for lightweight predictions of single-source detectability of GW candidates from electromagnetic time-domain surveys. Supported by these first two goals will be research to develop the framework and software interface needed to quickly assess AGN for the presence of SMBBHs.

CAREER: Investigating Matter and Spacetime Using Gravitational Waves,"Gravitational waves, a prediction of general relativity, are produced during the mergers of strongly gravitating objects, such as black holes and neutron stars. The NSF Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) facilities detect the waves from these mergers almost daily during operations. The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), also an NSF-supported collaboration, has detected a background of gravitational waves from many supermassive black holes throughout cosmic time. These detectors opened new windows onto the universe, provided novel insights into the nature of gravity, and impact fields beyond gravitational physics. This project will develop data analysis methods and perform new theoretical calculations to search for as-of-yet-undiscovered predictions of general relativity and identify new relativistic phenomena that could be observed through gravitational wave measurements by LIGO and NANOGrav. The PI will carry out the work in collaboration with students, who will learn transferable quantitative skills when conducting the research. The project also has a closely related educational component that involves creating new visualizations of the warped space around colliding black holes and accompanying recorded video explanations of the visualizations. This will help students learn about the LIGO discoveries and teachers to convey these results to their students. The project aims to use gravitational waves from black-hole and neutron-star mergers to understand the infrared properties of the gravitational interaction in general relativity (gravitational wave memory effects) and to probe the nature of dark matter around these systems when it is present in high densities. The primary research efforts of the project can be summarized in terms of four main goals, which are (i) to determine the prospects for pulsar timing arrays to detect the memory effect from intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals, which have not been systematically studied before; (ii) to compute analogs of the memory effect in electromagnetism and Yang-Mills theories, to highlight the similarities with and the unique differences from gravitational-wave memory effects; (iii) to perform simulation studies to determine the optimal method for searching for the gravitational wave memory effect in LIGO and Virgo data; and (iv) to model the gravitational waves from compact objects surrounded by dense distributions of dark matter and infer constraints that can be placed on the dark-matter cross-section, assuming there are non-gravitational interactions between nuclear matter and dark matter. The educational goals of the project are two-fold: (a) The PI and undergraduate students will make visualizations of the curved space around black-hole mergers, which illustrate how gravitational waves are generated and help convey the project's results in simpler terms. The PI will record video explanations of the visualizations with descriptions at three different levels: for high-school level students, for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students, and for experts who might use the visualizations in teaching. (b) This project also involves training undergraduate and graduate students to learn analytical, data analysis and numerical techniques highly valued in quantitative fields.

Studying Pairing Symmetries and Quasiparticle Dynamics in 2D Superconductors Using Superconducting Quantum Circuits,"Van der Waals (2D) materials are a family of two-dimensional crystals with diverse physical properties. These ultra-clean materials can be assembled in any desired order to create devices that exhibit various functionalities. Among them, 2D superconductor systems possess significant potential to enhance our understanding of superconductivity at a fundamental level and to develop new types of superconducting quantum devices for quantum technologies. This project aims to study the fundamental characteristics of Van der Waals (2D) superconductors relevant to quantum information science and technology. To explore Van der Waals materials the team will build hybrid superconducting circuits incorporating these 2D superconductors and leverage our team's expertise in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), quantum transport, and time-domain operation of quantum systems to enable this research. The team will explore the following directions: 1.) Kinetic inductance and pairing symmetries in moiré superconductors; 2.) Quasiparticle dynamics in 2D superconductors; 3.) Quasiparticle blocking using gap-tunable 2D superconductors; 4.) Microwave spectroscopy of Andreev levels and quasiparticle trapping characterization in graphene Josephson junctions. The proposed projects are strategically located at the intersection of condensed matter physics, 2D materials, and quantum information sciences. The results from the proposed works are expected to advance our knowledge of:; 1.) Superconductivity in interacting, highly-correlated systems, potentially leading to a better understanding of high-TC superconductors, such as the cuprates; 2.) Superconductivity in low-dimensional systems; 3.) Quasiparticle population and dynamics in crystalline 2D superconductors; 4.) Decoherence mechanisms and mitigation of quasiparticle poisoning of superconducting qubits; 5.) Interplay between mesoscopic superconductivity, Andreev physics, and coherence of superconducting qubits.

NSF-SNSF: Entanglement Theory in Quantum Networks,"Quantum technologies have the potential to radically impact science and society in the information age. In particular, quantum networks may eventually enable distributed quantum computing and new forms of quantum sensing. However, a deeper theoretical understanding of quantum networking is needed in order to verify the functionality and guide the development of novel architectures and use-cases for quantum networks. This project will explore new theoretical tools to study how entangled states can be created, manipulated, certified, and characterized in realistic quantum networks. This project will make a strong connection with current experimental capabilities while developing methods and protocols that are of direct relevance to current and near-term quantum network implementations. This project is structured along two main research lines. In one direction the research team aims to characterize the structure of multipartite entanglement in networks. The key questions are: which entangled states can be generated in a network? How can one efficiently certify multipartite entanglement in networks? How can one quantify network entanglement in an operationally meaningful way? In a second direction this team will explore the properties of quantum measurements at each network node. The fundamental questions they will explore are: what type of local measurements are possible when multiple quantum signals are received at different times and quantum memory is limited? What classes of multipartite entangled states can be generated under constrained entanglement swapping measurements? How do restricted local measurements lead to novel notions of network quantum steering and data hiding? This research project is poised to initiate new experimental collaborations, such as with researchers at both the PIs home institutions, the University of Geneva and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The US-Swiss scientific collaboration supported by this project will therefore grow beyond just the two PIs. This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.

Survival Threshold for Collective Plasma Oscillations,"The main objective of this project is to investigate questions about the final states of matter consisting of a sufficiently large number of interacting particles such as plasmas in plasma physics and condensates in quantum mechanics. The research will advance the understanding of turbulence in plasma physics and quantum mechanics, provide foundational mathematics to tackle unsolved problems in physics, and push the boundaries of current mathematical techniques. The research will contribute new techniques to the theory of partial differential equations, mathematical physics, dynamical systems, and applied mathematics. The project includes activities aimed at training graduate students and young researchers. The project will prove longstanding conjectures concerning the large time behavior of solutions to the mathematical mean field models that are used in plasma physics and quantum mechanics. The primary mathematical models under investigation include the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system and the Hartree equations used to model the nonlinear collective effects of infinitely many interacting particles. The research will rigorously validate nonlinear physical phenomena including plasma oscillations, phase transition, phase mixing, Landau damping, and the formation of coherent structures. The scattering theory as well as the formation of periodic structures for the Vlasov and Hartree equations near nontrivial translation-invariant equilibria will be established. The work of the project involves mathematical techniques from spectral theory, resolvent analysis, Fourier analysis, dispersive PDEs, probability, and statistical physics.

Next-generation muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy,"Muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy is concerned with the precise measurements of the x rays emitted in the cascade process taking place in a muonic atom, the bound state of a negative muon with a nucleus. These x rays reveal the level structure of the muonic atom which in turn can be used to extract properties of the nucleus such as its absolute charge radius or quadrupole moment, test bound-state quantum electro dynamics, measure the negative muon mass or analyze the elemental composition of an object.We propose here the development of a detection system capable to perform next-generation muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy. This is achieved by utilizing the by now mature technology of cryogenic metallic magnetic calorimeters that offer a major leap forwards in terms of achievable resolutions for energies up to around 200 keV. As a first measurement we will focus on extracting the absolute charge radii of the two stable boron isotopes 10,11B with a 35 fold improved precision relevant for ab-initio, few-body nuclear theory and upcoming laser spectroscopy on the unstable 8B isotope or helium-like 10,11B3+ .However, the impact of this development goes beyond the boron isotopes. The charge radii of all the elements from lithium to neon can be improved setting a new standard on the precision attainable in muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy and providing crucial input to experiments on helium-like ions or measurements of g-factors. Additionally, the new apparatus can provide improved measurements for all the topics mentioned in the introductory paragraph thus truly constituting the beginning of a new era for muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy.",395345,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Rigidity Theorems for Lattices,"The PI will investigate rigidity properties of hyperbolic manifolds. Hyperbolic manifolds are multi-dimensional shapes for which, when one stands at any point and looks in any pair of directions, the shape looks like a saddle. While such shapes can be hard to visualize in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, they are abundant in the study of geometry and represent the simplest examples of an important phenomenon called negative curvature. In contrast to other types of shapes, hyperbolic manifolds benefit from rich connections to algebra, via an invariant called the fundamental group, and dynamics, due to the chaotic nature of certain naturally associated dynamical systems. Therefore, in the study of these manifolds, a wide array of perspectives and techniques can be employed. The PI will leverage tools originating from different areas of mathematics to study rigidity phenomena for these manifolds. The PI will also engage in building support networks for junior mathematicians, organize conferences and speaker series, and engage in outreach efforts for middle and high school students across Oklahoma. The PI’s research centers on improving our understanding of rigidity and flexibility phenomenon for the fundamental groups of finite volume real and complex hyperbolic manifolds. The projects fall loosely into three categories of rigidity: measure rigidity, representation rigidity, and spectral rigidity. Specifically, over the lifetime of this grant, the PI will work on the following general problems: 1) developing tools to explore rigidity for semiclassical measures on hyperbolic manifolds, 2) exploring the extent to which geodesic submanifolds force rigidity phenomena for representations of fundamental groups of real and complex hyperbolic manifolds, and 3) understanding the extent to which (simple) length spectral rigidity holds for hyperbolic surfaces. These questions and methods lie at the interface between several distinct areas and thus will have applications in a range of fields including but not limited to geometry, dynamics, and geometric group theory.

WoU-MMA: Very High Energy and Multi-messenger Emission from Pulsars,"Pulsars are rapidly spinning, highly magnetized neutron stars formed from the explosions of massive stars, emitting radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite extensive studies over six decades, their mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recent gamma-ray observations have challenged existing theories of high-energy pulsar emission, and the joint detection of gamma rays and gravitational waves from merging neutron stars highlighted the potential of multi-messenger observations of such exotic objects. This award supports researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to conduct multi-messenger studies of pulsars, focusing on their highest energy emissions, gamma-ray variability, and gravitational wave emission. This requires analysis of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory in Mexico, an international collaboration of thirty institutions, along with data from both space- and ground-based experiments. The work involves graduate, undergraduate, and possibly high school students, working in a stimulating environment which will encourage their participation in one of Mexico's premier scientific experiments. With their extreme properties (e.g. density, magnetic field strength), and stable timing signatures, pulsars have intrigued scientists since their discovery in the late 1960s. GeV and TeV observations challenge existing theories, and along with joint detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron stars, suggested using these exotic objects as probes of fundamental physics, such as possible Lorentz invariance violations. HAWC has a large field of view and a high duty cycle and has been operational since 2015. Its broad survey of the Northern Hemisphere TeV gamma-ray sky has detected dozens of sources, many of which are coincident with known Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsars. This project involves a comprehensive joint analysis of Fermi-LAT, HAWC, and LIGO/Virgo data to study the highest energy pulsar emission, and search for possible gamma-ray variability and gravitational wave emission coincident with pulsar glitches. This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.

Galaxy Predictions for the Faint and Low Surface Brightness Universe,"Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are the faintest galaxies known. They typically contain only 100 to 100,000 stars. Ultrafaint dwarfs are excellent probes for cosmology and the nature of dark matter. They also offer a new regime to understand processes like star-formation and stellar feedback. Currently, only about 100 of these faint galaxies are known, all within the volume of the Local Group. Surveys from telescopes like the Vera Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will allow the discovery of ultrafaint dwarfs within a 100-1000 times larger volume. However, theoretical predictions from numerical simulations are unable to reach the necessary resolution to model such small galaxies, limiting the reach of observational efforts. This investigator will combine a set of analytical methods and idealized numerical simulations to effectively extend the range of predictions of current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to the regime of faint and ultra-faint dwarfs. Through the Cal-Bridge program, undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will participate fully in this research, receiving training in computer programming along with presentation and writing skills. She will also develop workshops to train middle and high-school teachers with hands-on activities based on topics related to this proposal. The PI and her research team will use tidal tracks describing the tidal evolution of satellites to supplement the cosmological simulations of groups and clusters from the TNG project in regimes where the simulations are under-resolved. This will enable their model to make predictions for the satellite population in groups and clusters, including faint and ultrafaint dwarfs. With their simulated catalogs they will address three fundamental topics. (1) Predictions for the number, stellar/luminosity function, sizes and radial distribution of satellite galaxies within groups and clusters. (2) Study the impact of tidal stripping in the formation of compact objects such as compact ellipticals (cE) dwarfs. (3) Quantify the number and properties of stellar streams expected in groups and clusters in Lambda-CDM.

Variable Coefficient Fourier Analysis,"The PI will study several problems in Geometric Harmonic Analysis. The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more. Associated with a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions. These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle. Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits, as well as the sound volume. Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and the PI will study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the properties properties of eigenfunctions. Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger. These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the PI will study similar problems involving it. The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. Among the specific problems the PI shall study, they wish to obtain improved estimates that measure the size and concentration of eigenfunctions. In order to do this, they will develop what is called ``global harmonic analysis’’, which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis, and techniques from geometry. The basic estimates are Lp-estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes and related highly localized L2 estimates that are sensitive to concentration. The main questions center around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affect the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them. The latter issue is closely related to the much-studied (but still not well-understood) questions of concentration, oscillation, and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics. These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation, Schrodinger equation, and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian. High frequency solutions and obtaining sharp results under geometric assumptions are particularly interesting. They will also study functions that saturate the estimates in different ways depending on the sign of the sectional curvatures of the manifolds.

RUI: Testing Fundamental Symmetries in Neutron Beta Decay,"This RUI award provides opportunities for the PI and students to work at EKU, a regional PUI university, on local and national collaborations in the field of fundamental symmetries, using neutrons to resolve scientific discrepancies of national priority. Examining precisely how long the neutron lives and how it decays can provide sensitive tests of the Standard Model (SM). The PI’s group is actively collaborating on the BL3 and Nab experiments, which aim to resolve discrepancies in measurements of the neutron lifetime and decay correlations. The scale of the BL3 and Nab experiments and their use of techniques from many subfields of physics lend itself to hands-on student participation and the development of a broad understanding of physical principles and experimental techniques, which will help prepare students for careers in STEM fields. This project will give students an extraordinary experience at a regional university, travel to national labs, experience with a larger collaboration, and help them carve out meaningful roles in the scientific workforce. Additionally, the proposed activities will recruit first generation students and students from URMs in the Appalachian region and increase their visibility through this work. Examining the weak interaction through low energy, precision measurements in neutron beta decay can probe the mixing of quarks in the weak interaction, additional forms the weak interaction may take on, and some forms of supersymmetry. In addition to being the cleanest theoretical description of beta decay, neutron beta decay inherently offers multiple ways to evaluate the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix (CKM matrix), which allows for multiple independent checks for beyond SM physics. To test this symmetry with the neutron, a combination of a measurement of the ratio of the axial-vector to vector coupling, λ, in the electroweak interaction and the neutron lifetime is required. Currently, measurements of λ and the neutron lifetime using different methods are in conflict with each other and resolving these discrepancies is of high intellectual priority. Resolving these problems are priorities in nuclear science with implications in the interplay of cosmology and particle physics. This award will increase the PI’s leadership roles in these experiments and include the following student-centered projects: continuing fast scintillation development for systematic studies in Nab, developing complex Monte Carlo simulations for systematic studies in the BL3 and Nab experiments, digitizer and DAQ development for BL3, and carrying out the last phase of the Nab magnetometry measurements.

Electron transport in topological conductors and superconducting systems,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY Rapid progress in nanofabrication of quantum electronic devices enables unprecedented control and tunability as well as experimental realization of new collective states of electrons. The quantum motion of electrons in these states is correlated. In other words, electrons move not independently of each other but in a cohesive correlated fashion. Understanding the character of these correlations is crucial for characterizing charge transport in quantum electronic devices. Some correlations result in ordering of the electrons and thus change the symmetry of the system; an example is a formation of a charge density wave, in which the electron density in the system develops a wave-like periodic spatial modulation. There are more subtle quantum correlations of the electron liquid, which are called topological. These topological correlations cannot be changed by small changes of the system, and thus distinguish qualitatively different classes of electron systems. Importantly, they are immune to material imperfections and disorder, which are critically important for useful device creation. This award supports theoretical studies of charge transport and of the physical mechanisms of energy relaxation in correlated electron systems. A particular focus will be placed on studying charge density wave ordering in metals with topological correlations. Another part of research will be devoted to the study of current rectification in conductors the crystal structures of which lack inversion symmetry. Part of the research will be devoted to investigating the influence of energy relaxation on the charge transport in superconducting devices. The latter may prove useful for applications of superconducting devices to quantum computing, and also to quantum sensing (e.g. for superconductor-based photon detectors). The research program will be integrated with an education component. It will provide training to graduate students and enable engaging undergraduate students in research projects in quantum condensed matter theory. The PI will create and lead a problem-solving seminar in quantum mechanics that will help physics majors master advanced methods of quantum mechanics. TECHNICAL SUMMARY The project is stimulated by recent advances in the nanofabrication of quantum electronic devices, which enable unprecedented control and tunability of the electron systems and realization of new electronic phases and physical regimes. The proposed work is organized around three themes: 1) Topological surface and bulk effects in the excitonic insulator phase of Weyl semimetals: At low temperatures, Weyl semimetals (WSM) may become unstable towards the formation of an excitonic insulating phase. The project will investigate the nontrivial band topology of the parent WSM and distinct features in the bulk and surface electron response of this insulating phase, as well as the influence of topology on the bulk properties of the excitonic phase. 2) Theory of nonreciprocal electron transport in the hydrodynamic regime: Nonlinear electron response need not obey the Onsager reciprocity relations. Part of the project is devoted to the study of nonreciprocal transport in the nonlinear hydrodynamic regime, specifically the role of absence of Galilean invariance plays in the physical mechanism behind nonreciprocal hydrodynamic transport. 3) The third research direction is devoted to the study of dissipation mechanisms in superconducting systems. Although charge transport in normal conductors is not significantly affected by energy relaxation, in superconducting systems this is not the case. Part of the project will investigate the influence of energy relaxation on the charge transport in superconducting devices. The recently developed theory of Debye dissipation in superconductors will be extended to hybrid superconductor/semiconductors Josephson arrays. The research program will be integrated with an education component. It will provide training to graduate students and enable engaging undergraduate students in research projects in quantum condensed matter theory. The PI will create and lead a problem-solving seminar in quantum mechanics that will help physics majors master advanced methods of quantum mechanics.

Probing the Standard Model with the LHCb Detector at the Large Hadron Collider,"Abstract: Probing the Standard Model with the LHCb Detector at the Large Hadron Collider Fundamental particles and their interactions are described by the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics. Although the SM has been remarkably successful in its ability to describe observations of elementary particles to date, there are good reasons to believe that this model is incomplete, and that some new physics should exist beyond the Standard Model. Proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can probe the Standard Model at the highest energies ever achieved in the laboratory. This award will support a research program at the University of Cincinnati that takes advantage of the unique capabilities of the LHCb experiment at the LHC to probe SM predictions, and may reveal evidence for new physics beyond the SM. The force-carriers of the Weak interaction are known as W bosons. This award makes the first measurements of the helicity of W bosons and of the production of pairs of W bosons in the forward region at LHC. These measurements will be important tests of the SM theory predictions at the energy frontier. This award will also study rare decays of B and other mesons and contribute to the future upgrade of the LHCb electromagnetic calorimeter, taking a leading role in development of the calibration system. Broader impacts of this research program will arise through efforts to broaden participation in physics, at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. The work will seek to inspire more high school students to choose a future in physics by providing students and their teachers with experience of high-energy physics research through participation in the QuarkNet teacher training program. This will also provide opportunities and mentoring for undergraduates to participate in research at the LHC, and we will strive to support students from under-represented groups to pursue graduate degrees in physics.

Well-posedness and Long-time Behavior of Dispersive Integrable Systems,"Integrable systems have long served as guides in the study of Hamiltonian partial differential equations. They arise as effective models of real physical systems, including in optics and many-body quantum mechanics. It is in the setting of completely integrable systems that solitons and multisolitons were first discovered. These structures have since found numerous applications in the applied sciences: for example, in fiber optics, solitons have been employed in the transmission of digital signals over long distances, while in biology, they are used to describe signal propagation in the nervous system and low-frequency collective motion in proteins. This project seeks to investigate both longstanding and newly introduced integrable models. Specifically, we seek to find the minimal conditions on the initial state under which one can construct global-in-time dynamics, investigate the (in)stability of special structures (such as solitons and multisolitons), and elucidate the long-time behavior of general solutions. The project provides significant research training opportunities for graduate students, who are integrated into the main objectives of the project. The project investigates the following specific questions for the newly introduced continuum Calogero-Moser equations: (1) large data well-posedness in the scaling-invariant space, (2) scattering for both the defocusing model and the focusing equation for initial data with mass less than that of the ground state soliton, and (3) the determination of the blowup threshold in the focusing case. Further objectives include orbital and asymptotic stability of multisoliton solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation in optimal well-posedness spaces, dispersive decay away from the soliton component for large solutions to this equation, and the construction of Gibbs dynamics for the Landau-Lifshitz model.

"Interplay Between non-Fermi Liquid, Superconductivity, and Pseudogap Behavior in Quantum-Critical Metals","NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research and education to examine superconductivity in the strong coupling regime. Superconductivity, the ability of electrons to conduct electric current without dissipation below a certain temperature called Tc, is not only one of the most remarkable phenomena emerging from the quantum physics of many interacting electrons but is also of great technological importance. Metrology, lossless energy transmission, and quantum computation are important examples. Earlier theoretical studies of superconductivity were based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model, which assumed that electrons are weakly interacting. This approach was questioned after the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity first in cuprate oxides and then in other series of compounds, including, most recently, graphene-based systems. Experiments revealed that these materials display behavior, which differs fundamentally from that expected for ordinary superconductors both above Tc and below Tc. These discoveries called for a qualitatively new theory of superconductivity in the regime of strong interactions between electrons. In this project, the PI and his students will work to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in these unusual materials and the competition between superconductivity and other ordered states of interacting electrons, such as magnetism. This is a problem with no easy answer because strong interaction makes it more difficult to establish a dissipation-less current flow, required for superconductivity. At the same time, the stronger the interaction the higher Tc is expected. Understanding the dual role of strong interactions also the interplay between superconductivity and other possible ordered states is the main goal of the proposed work. Theoretical advances resulting from this project may guide the identification of materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures and desirable properties, which should have a revolutionary impact on society. This project will contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by training two graduate students. The PI will continue running conferences and lecturing at schools for graduate students and junior faculty. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research and education which will examine superconductivity in the strong coupling regime. This is a central problem in experimental and theoretical condensed-matter physics. In addition to incipient practical applications, the interest in this field is driven by the fascinating variety of observed effects and universality of underlying theoretical ideas. The PI will focus on several fundamental issues related to a system behavior near a quantum-critical point (QCP), where interaction, mediated by a soft critical boson, provides a mechanism for pairing and at the same time gives rise to non-Fermi liquid normal state behavior. The issues the PI will address include understanding: the competition between fermionic incoherence and Cooper pairing, a fundamentally non-BCS pairing mechanism, how dynamical vortices emerge, a topological transition that occurs when the number of vortices becomes infinite, the bound pair state without phase coherence, and the collective modes of a quantum-critical superconductor. The PI will also analyze theoretically superconductivity emerging from a pseudogap state, with special emphasis on the behavior of superfluid stiffness and on the range where bound pairs of fermions form, but remain incoherent and do not give rise to supercurrent. In related studies, the PI will analyze superconductivity in a two-dimensional metal near a van Hove singularity and near the end point of s-wave superconductivity in systems with electron-phonon attraction and Hubbard repulsion. The PI will contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by training two graduate students in modern theoretical condensed matter physics and will continue running conferences and workshops and lecturing at schools for graduate students and junior faculty.

"Probes of Fundamental QCD Symmetries and BSM Physics Via the Neutral pion, eta and eta' Decays","Fundamental symmetries of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low-energies and new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) are two frontiers in physics. The primary goal of this project is to explore both fundamental topics with experimental sensitivities not previously achievable via two on-going experiments at Jefferson Lab: PrimEx-eta and JLab Eta Factory (JEF). The results from these experiments will shed light on some fundamental questions: How did the mass of visible matter emerge in the early universe? Why are quarks confined in “color neutral” particles? What is the nature of dark matter that constitutes 85% of matter and what is the cause for the asymmetry of matter-antimatter observed in the universe? The scope of this project, including hardware development, performance of the actual experiment and data analysis, will provide advanced training for a postdoctoral researcher and a group of undergraduate students. It will help them to acquire significant technical skills through hands-on experience, data analysis and computation, as well as critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. The opportunities for young researchers (postdoc and students) working at Jefferson Lab will enhance their international experience and global perspectives. The female PI of this project will help promote diversity and inclusion by attracting more women to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics program. The PrimEx-eta experiment will measure the η radiative decay width via the Primakoff effect. It will shed light on a longstanding discrepancy (~4σ) between the previous experimental results using the Primakoff and the e+e- collisions; and will offer accurate determinations of the light quark-mass ratio and the η-η' mixing angle. The JEF experiment will measure various η/ηꞌ decays with emphasis on rare neutral modes, producing a clean dataset with background suppression by two orders of magnitude compared to previous experiments. In addition to the baseline GlueX apparatus, the JEF experiment requires an upgraded forward calorimeter (FCAL-II) with a high-granularity, high-resolution PbWO4 crystal core in the central region to minimize shower overlaps and to optimize resolutions of the reconstructed energy and position. The data from the JEF experiment will provide sensitive probes to: (a) explore the role of scalar meson dynamics in the chiral perturbation theory for the first time; (b) tighten the uncertainty in the light quark mass ratio using the η→3π Dalitz distributions; (c) search for various sub-GeV dark gauge boson candidates (including vectors, scalars and Axion-like particles) to improve the existing bounds by up to two orders of magnitude that is complementary to the ongoing worldwide efforts at high-energy collider and underground facilities; and (d) provide the best direct constraints for C-violating, P-conserving new forces. As a co-spokesperson, the PI will play a leadership role in carrying out these experiments. The PI and her team will: (1) analyze the PrimEx-eta experimental data to deliver the physics result; (2) commission the FCAL-II calorimeter and run the JEF experiment that is scheduled to start in Jan 2025.

Collaborative Research: Hunting for Warped Accretion Disks and Jets around Supermassive Black Holes,"Recent years have seen dramatic advances in our understanding of black holes and the accretion disks feeding them. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is an array of radio telescopes spread out across the Earth, which can spatially resolve the event horizon of nearby supermassive black holes. One of the biggest outstanding questions is whether the accretion disk is spinning in the same direction as the black hole or is tilted with respect to the black hole. In such tilted systems the accretion disk can get warped. In this collaborative project, the PIs will leverage recent improvements to the EHT array with advances in (machine-learning based) image-reconstruction algorithms and high resolution numerical simulations to look for signatures of warping in EHT observations. The PIs will involve junior scientists including undergraduates and high school students in their groups, and will actively recruit students from marginalized identities for these positions. The PIs will also engage with the public through the media and public talks, and they will strive to develop visually stunning and informative materials to accompany the main results. The PIs will develop and analyze an extensive general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation library that spans a wide range of parameters. Their simulations will include the effects of accretion disk tilt, account for the two-temperature nature of the plasma, and incorporate the effects of radiative cooling. Tilt is particularly interesting, since recent numerical simulations demonstrated that warps form in tilted accretion disks around spinning black holes. Warped disks in high-accretion rate sources may form nozzle shocks, which dissipate energy orders of magnitude faster than magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven turbulence. Subsequently, the PIs will compare their new simulation library with EHT observations. In addition, they have developed a new dictionary learning algorithm using simulations as a training set to more accurately analyze EHT data. Their algorithm does not suffer from spurious artifacts such as bright ""knots"" seen along the ring in previous EHT images, and it achieves a significantly higher spatial resolution than traditional image reconstruction methods.

REU Site: Sustainable Physics at Penn State: From the Subatomic to the Cosmos,"This award supports a new Physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Pennsylvania State University. The award will support eight students per year for summer research in multidisciplinary physics topics with a common theme of sustainability aimed at developing awareness for the many-faceted impact of physics research on the planet. The undergraduate students will participate in a 10 week summer research experience, together with career development training focused on the convergence between cutting edge physics research and its environmental, social, and global impacts. Research seminars and professional development activities will fortify students' research experience through communication skills training and sustainability-awareness, enhancing their qualifications and preparation for future research careers. Participants' culminating experience will be threefold: participation in a large, end-of-summer research symposium, an option to present at a national or local conference, and a written reflection on the sustainability aspects of their research to be shared with their research group. REU participants will contribute to research projects spanning particle and astroparticle physics, cosmology, gravitational wave astronomy, atomic molecular and optical physics, and condensed matter physics, mentored by one of the 28 physics faculty conducting experimental, theoretical or computational research with active undergraduate student participation. Specific topics include multi-messenger astrophysics, dark matter, quantum information, two-dimensional nanoscale materials, material memory and photonics. REU participants will develop research skills through their mentored projects, and will participate in career-forward activities for increased research confidence and success, including lab safety and ethics training, research seminars, lab visits, and scientific communication assignments.

WoU-MMA: Multi-messenger Observations in the Era of Supermassive Black Holes,"For hundreds of years, visible-light waves have been used to detect signals from outer space. Some dark, massive objects in space might not directly emit light waves; a well-known example of this is black holes. Only in the last decade have astronomers begun to be able to directly detect black holes using signals called gravitational waves. The largest black hole binaries--supermassive black hole binaries--are unique in that they are formed in galaxy mergers. This means that they will often exist in rich, messy environments full of plasma, gas, dust, stars, and other materials. This material, when it interacts with a binary system, should light up like a luminous beacon across radio, optical, X-ray light, and more. The black holes in the center of these systems may also emit gravitational waves. A broad suite of instruments (spanning gravitational waves, electromagnetic light and neutrino observatories) are all poised to completely revolutionize our understanding of the full lifecycle of supermassive black hole binaries. Hundreds of published candidates for these objects now exist, however none have yet been conclusively evidenced to be a binary. In this program, the research team aims to organize and publicly serve disparate information about these binary candidates to facilitate massive black hole science in this era of multi-messenger discovery. They will also use the black hole database as the keystone for educational programs from high school through grad school. Existing efforts in West Virginia, such as the Governors’ STEM schools, will facilitate the BI activities. The PIs are developing a public resource to organize information on supermassive binary black hole systems. This ""Black Holes Orbiting Black Holes Catalog,"" BOBcat, will help scientists organize the complex and constantly growing knowledge about the most massive binary black holes in the universe. The information overload from published models will be structured into an online resource that will continue to evolve as further studies are produced. BOBcat will serve as an organizing resource for studies that probe binary intermediate/supermassive black holes with electromagnetic studies, and test massive black hole binary emission theories. This program will establish an already-needed resource that will be a prime facilitator in the multi-messenger era.

Germanium MOSFETs for quantum computation,"This project investigates holes in germanium (Ge) metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) nanostructures, which have not been considered for spin qubit integration before. Ge offers several advantages over silicon (Si), including the straightforward formation of p-type ohmic contacts, higher mobility (the highest of all known semiconductor materials), and lower effective mass of holes. These properties could make it easier to fabricate large-scale qubit systems with relaxed lithographic requirements. Compared to Ge/SiGe heterostructures that are grown on Si substrates and strain engineered virtual substrates, Ge-MOSFETs promise superior compatibility with industrial manufacturing techniques. They offer a larger thermal budget and provide improved electrostatic control since the charge carriers are closer to the gate electrodes. Additionally, not relying on heterostructures can reduce local alloy and strain fluctuations which impair device homogeneity. However, MOSFETs can face material-specific noise and disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface. We use a two-fold strategy to address this issue: First, our hybrid Ge-oxide stacks are grown in situ by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on dislocation-free Ge substrates with a crystalline layer of magnesium oxide (MgO) being grown epitaxially on Ge without breaking the vacuum. Second, the Ge-MOS structures will employ a gate metal that minimizes interface strain at cryogenic temperatures (we explore TiN and W). Our project is a collaboration between academia and industry, bringing together experts from material growth, quantum theory, and measurement. All this expertise is crucial for reliably producing hole spin qubits in low charge noise Ge-MOS quantum dots (QDs) produced with industrial manufacturing processes. The project outline is to start by identifying growth conditions and materials resulting in the highest hole mobility through Hall bar measurements, study material properties using quantum point contacts, and then fabricate and characterize QD devices at cryogenic temperatures. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the potential of the Ge-MOS platform by realizing hole spin qubits with competitive coherence times and control speeds.",381469,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland; Germany,Switzerland,Engineering; Materials Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics
Topology in many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to investigate the behavior of quantum systems with many particles, such as electrons in a crystalline solid. The large number of electrons and their inherent quantum mechanical nature can act in concert leading to new states of matter. Among these are superconductors, which can conduct electricity with zero resistance, and the quantum Hall states, in which a strong magnetic field causes electrons confined to two dimensions to execute tight circular orbits, thereby forcing net electrical current flow to thei edges of the system. The goal of the PI’s work is to combine tools from theoretical condensed matter and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these states of quantum matter. In the last few years, quantum computing has motivated significant progress in condensed matter theory. Quantum computing deals with systems that contain many quantum bits, providing a new perspective on the physics of systems of many quantum mechanical particles that is complementary to the traditional one. The PI will combine new quantum computing inspired methods with standard condensed matter techniques to gain a better understanding of the landscape of condensed matter phases. One particular benefit of this program is that some of the exotic condensed matter phases studied by the PI may in turn have applications to the design of new quantum computing platforms. Under this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD. The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics, and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to classify topological quantum phases of matter, including those that are out of equilibrium and those protected by additional symmetries. The PI will combine ideas from condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the PI will connect the topological features of quantum field theories, such as topological terms in continuum effective actions, to topological invariants that can in principle be directly extracted from a lattice Hamiltonian, such as braiding statistics of anyon or defect excitations. Because a lattice quantum many-body system is essentially a many-qubit system, it is natural that ideas from quantum information theory will naturally be involved in this work. One quantum information idea is that of a non-trivial quantum cellular automaton, which is a generalization of a shallow-depth circuit of local unitaries. The PI will explore the utility of using such quantum cellular automatons to disentangle exotic, “beyond-cohomology,” symmetry protected topological phases of matter. An additional tool that the PI plans to use is that of the conformal bootstrap. This is a numerical technique that constrains the possible conformal field theories that can exist, by putting bounds on their spectra of dimensions of local operators. Building on preliminary work, the PI's team will research how to constrain the conformal field theories that can exist at the boundaries of topological phases, by incorporating the corresponding 't Hooft anomalies into the conformal bootstrap. More generally, the aim of the PI will be to determine how to incorporate information about the non-local operators that appear in topological field-theories into the conformal bootstrap. Furthermore, the PI will also explore topological effects in non-equilibrium settings, such as the recently introduced measurement-induced entanglement transition. Preliminary work by the PI's team has uncovered, for a certain simple instance of this transition, a dual statistical-mechanics model which exhibits a topological phase transition. The PI plans to explore more general versions of this duality. Under this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD. The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.

Partial Differential Equation Methods in Kinetic Theory and Their Applications,"The Principal Investigator (PI) will study several important mathematical problems arising in physics: 1) In the study of a body of gas with prescribed boundary temperature, the PI plans to understand mathematically the intriguing `ghost effect' on heat conduction predicted 50 years ago; 2) The control of plasma-wall interaction is important in nuclear fusion, and the PI will study the role of such interactions mathematically in a tokamak-like geometry. He also plans to derive and justify important fluid models for describing a plasma and to demonstrate absence of shock formation in the presence of an external magnetic effect; 3) In contrast to a black hole, a naked singularity is a gravitational collapse of a star which can be observed. The existence and stability of such a naked singularity is a fundamental theoretical open question in the study of Einstein's theory for general relativity. The PI plans to establish stability of a naked singularity recently discovered via his previous NSF support; 4) Even though contact lines (e.g. boundary line where coffee meets the coffee cup, or boundary line of a drop of fluid on a table) play an important role in the study of fluids, it has been an outstanding question to model and determine the dynamics of these contact lines. The PI continues his effort to understand this challenging problem mathematically. As broader impacts of the proposed research, the PI plans to work to investigate the ghost effect from experimental and numerical standpoints, in collaborations with other researchers. The PI also continues to train PhD students and postdoctoral fellows through these research projects. On the technical level, the PI will 1) establish dynamical stability for recently constructed kinetic ghost effect in heat conduction, based on his recent decisive construction of `ghost effect' solutions; 2) Based on his recent work, the PI plans to construct global unique solutions for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system, a fundamental kinetic model for describing a plasma, in the presence of a perfect conducting boundary in a tokamak-like geometry. The PI also plans to construct global well-posedness for Boltzmann equation with inverse power kernels in a bounded domain and derive fluid equations as the hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann theory; 3) The PI discovered that there is no shock formation in plasma two-fluid models (Euler-Maxwell system) for irrotational flows with small amplitude in his previously funded research. Thanks to his recent decisive discovery of a new mechanism of rotation to suppress singularity formation, the PI plans to construct global axisymmetric smooth rotating flows in the presence of an external magnetic field; 4) The PI continues his study to establish stability of gravitational collapse and naked singularity via analyzing spectrum problems in self-similar variables with the help of the interval arithmetic techniques; 5) The PI plans to establish the first PDE justification of dynamic fluid models for describing capillary surface or contact lines in 3D, based on his recent success in 2D.

Collaborative Research: Pinning down the source of the L/T transition with the help of polarimetry.,"Brown dwarfs, often referred to as ""failed stars,"" occupy a fascinating middle ground between stars and planets. As these objects age, they undergo a dramatic transformation known as the L/T transition, during which their atmospheres and observed properties change rapidly. This transition is crucial for understanding the evolution of brown dwarfs, as well as for drawing parallels with many imaged exoplanets, which often resemble these brown dwarfs. This research team will illuminate the mysteries of the L/T transition using the technique of polarimetry. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain hands-on experience in modeling, observation, and data analysis. The team will also develop educational resources, including a website and interactive tools, to engage and inform high school and university students about polarimetry and its applications in astrophysics. The L/T transition in brown dwarfs is marked by rapid atmospheric changes that affect their color and variability in light. This project seeks to address the underlying causes of these changes by using polarimetry to provide new constraints on the models of brown dwarf atmospheres. The research will involve creating a comprehensive grid of models that incorporate both cloud formation and chemical processes, assessing their impact on both flux and polarization signals. This grid will be instrumental in interpreting both existing and new polarimetric observations. The primary goals are to refine the understanding of the L/T transition and to develop tools that will aid in the design and analysis of future polarimetric observations of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. The project includes a significant training component, supporting two graduate students and 1-2 undergraduates annually at UCF, JHU, and UCSB. The team will develop a dedicated website and educational materials to promote the technique of polarimetry and its applications, thereby fostering greater engagement with the broader scientific community and the public.

"Developing an AI-assisted, Full-band, all Digital Trigger for Radio Neutrino Astronomy","The primary science mission for radio-based high energy neutrino technology is to search for astrophysical sources of neutrinos with extremely high energies, at least 100,000 times higher than the highest energy particles created by the strongest terrestrial particle accelerators. Observations at this extreme provide insight into the nature of the most extreme particle accelerators in the Universe and may point to the long-sought sources of the highest energy cosmic rays. The NSF-supported ARIANNA collaboration pioneered the development of the surface station architecture for radio-based neutrino astronomy and is thus ideally placed to contribute to multi-messenger science, providing critical capabilities such as excellent pointing resolution and measurement of the neutrino cross-section. This research will create the next generation of trigger technology and will revitalize the successful design and operation of surface station experiments. The project will provide training in both hardware and software to students at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including under-represented groups and women. Such experience will be a valuable asset for future workforce placement. The ARIANNA design relies on the observation of radio emission from neutrino interactions in cold transparent Antarctic ice by radio antennas buried only a few meters below the snow surface, but previously used a very simple scheme to trigger the detector. The next generation of trigger technology will exploit the unique ”chirped” features of the waveforms produced by these shallow antennas by developing an all-digital trigger, so that trigger schemes can access the full data records before creating their trigger event. This new trigger hardware will implement AI tools such as Deep Learning, which work best with unfiltered data directly imported from high speed digitizers.

ECLIPSE: Ultrafast Diagnostics and Characterization of Nonequilibrium Laser-induced Filament Plasmas,"This project will use novel diagnostics and machine learning to better understand laser-induced formation of plasma filaments in air. Laser-induced filamentation occurs when an intense laser beam travels through a medium like air and forms a self-guided, stable channel of plasma known as a filament. This happens because of a dynamical balance between the self-focusing of the laser beam, known as the Kerr effect, and the defocusing of the laser beam by the plasma. The filament plasma is a type of nonequilibrium plasma, where the electron temperature can reach tens of thousands of kelvins, while the ion and neutral temperatures are only a few hundred kelvins. Better understanding of laser-induced filament plasmas can enable many applications, including improving combustion performance with laser ignition sources, creating new light sources for Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, remote stand-off detection, air lasers for remote detection, and hypersonic flow control. The research project focuses on understanding the plasma dynamics of laser-induced nonequilibrium filament plasmas by various novel ultrafast diagnostic methods, including Resonantly Ionized Photoemission Thermometry (RIPT) and MUltiplexed Structure Imaging and Capture (MUSIC). Plasma kinetic models with physics informed neural network will be calibrated and validated by the experimental measurements. The goals of the project are to understand and quantify the nonequilibrium states of laser-induced filament plasmas; to broaden student participation in plasma physics research; and to integrate research with teaching to enhance students' learning experience. An associated comprehensive educational plan is poised to significantly impact the education of the next generation workforce in plasma science and engineering for both undergraduate and graduate students.

"Collaborative Research: CDS&E: Data-Driven Discovery of Neural ODE Dynamics, Astrophysical Models, and Orbits (Neural ODE DynAMO)","Scientists recently detected gravitational waves from black holes and neutron stars orbiting each other. These waves, which were first predicted by Albert Einstein, are like ripples in space-time created by the movement of massive objects in distant galaxies. Current models of these gravitational waves focus on two-body systems, like a pair of black holes or neutron stars orbiting each other, without considering the effects of their astrophysical environments. The main scientific challenge is incorporating these complex environmental interactions into the models. This award will fund an interdisciplinary team from multiple institutions to use new machine learning advancements to tackle these challenges. The resulting models and machine learning techniques will allow researchers to study powerful collisions of binary black holes in extreme environments. Moreover, this research project will engage the public through outreach activities and train diverse students with strong backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math, preparing them for careers requiring technical and computational skills. This research team's previous work introduced gravitational waveform inversion (GWI), a machine-learning technique for discovering orbital models from gravitational waveform data without environmental effects. The current project aims to advance GWI by incorporating environmental effects to discover new, detailed physical models. To this end, the team will develop specific models for dark matter halos and disc-embedded extreme mass ratio inspiral systems. The team will also focus on connecting their models to observations by interfacing with – and contributing to – open-source projects such as PyCBC and the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit. This new approach could unlock the full potential of upcoming gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA, revealing precise information about binary black hole systems and their host environments.

Dynamics of Few-Body Systems,"The goal of this theory project is to develop a quantum-mechanical treatment of the time evolution of small systems of atoms or molecules interacting with one another. It is expected that this will, on the one hand, reveal intriguing few-body phenomena and, on the other hand, help our understanding of the dynamics of larger systems, where microscopic treatments are, in general, much more challenging. The proposed work will contribute toward the design of protocols for controlling chemical reaction pathways, which will make it possible to reach the desired target states through especially engineered pulse sequences. This prospect has long-term implications for drug design, quantum simulation, and quantum technology. The anticipated research outcomes are also expected to have significant impact within the field of atomic and molecular physics as well as in other fields of physics, including chemical physics, condensed matter physics, and high-energy physics. The training of undergraduate and graduate students in theoretical quantum physics is critical for combatting the predicted workforce shortage in the United States in quantum-related areas. Efforts will be directed at enriching the student experience and building a welcoming and safe environment, in which a student body that is representative of the population’s demographics can succeed. The PI will organize international workshops and conferences with diverse speaker demographics. The research team, which consists of the PI, graduate students, and undergraduate students, will study (i) the laser-induced-dynamics of rare gas molecules and (ii) the dynamics of small trapped ultracold gases. (i) In contrast to heavy diatomic molecules such as the iodine and nitrogen dimers, where rotational revivals have been studied extensively, light molecules such as helium, helium-neon, and neon dimers exhibit entirely different dynamics due to the coupling of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. The response of light rare gas dimers, trimers, and tetramers to one or more short intense laser pulses is largely unexplored, leaving many open questions related to the effects of the pulse length, shape, polarization, and pulse sequence. The project is expected to provide a clear picture of how the pump-probe dynamics changes, from the impulse to the adiabatic regimes, as the molecule under study changes from being extremely floppy to behaving like a rigid rotor. Extensions to the three-body sector will shed light on the correlations of the extremely weakly-bound helium trimer. Pump-probe spectroscopy of weakly-bound van der Waals dimers and trimers will be established as a platform for studying correlated tunneling dynamics with unprecedented spatial resolution. (ii) Effectively low-dimensional geometries have been predicted to suppress three-body recombination and have also played a critical role in recent ultracold atom studies related to hydrodynamic-like behavior. By studying the dynamics of three- and four-particle systems with s- or p-wave two-body interactions under effectively low-dimensional confinement—including the dimensional crossover—, the project will provide much needed few-body benchmarks that go significantly beyond the extensively-studied strict one-dimensional and spherically-symmetric three-dimensional regimes. The proposed oscillating field-induced dynamics will benchmark coherent spectroscopy, yield insights into the stability of effectively low-dimensional systems, and provide critically needed theory calculations for how interactions are renormalized by fast oscillating confinement potentials. The anticipated results for the spectral response are expected to serve as benchmarks across several physics sub-disciplines, including chemical physics.

Decoherence in Entangled Organic Molecules,"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jonathan Hood of Purdue University is investigating entangled states of organic molecules. Entanglement is a quantum mechanical property in which the behavior of two molecules is correlated, even when they are well-separated from each other. However, to entangle two molecules, they must have the same energy, which is difficult to achieve in molecular systems. Entanglement is also fragile, and once it is created, it can be lost through decoherence. Professor Hood and his students will employ laser-induced tuning to bring arrays of molecules into resonance (i.e., make their energies equal) and observe the decoherence of entangled states by measuring correlations of the emitted photons. Their discoveries could lead to advancements in quantum-based technologies for computing, encryption, and communication. Additionally, the project will contribute to developing a quantum-enabled workforce by providing research opportunities and outreach programs to a multi-disciplinary group of students. Currently, quantum light with many photons is inefficiently generated from single photons. A novel approach to addressing this issue involves utilizing multiple emitters to create many-photon entangled light. However, this strategy faces challenges when working with solid-state emitters, particularly in bringing lifetime-limited solid-state emitters into resonance. This research aims to tackle these challenges through two main objectives. The first goal is to integrate organic molecules into nanophotonic cavities and waveguides, thereby enhancing photon collection efficiency and the zero-phonon line. By doing so, the system's overall performance can be significantly improved. The second goal focuses on bringing multiple coupled molecules into resonance and generating entangled states between the emitters and photons. This step is crucial for creating high-fidelity quantum states of light that are essential for various applications. The outcomes of this work are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of decoherence in collective quantum states. Furthermore, it aims to provide a scalable method for producing high-fidelity quantum states of light, which have significant potential in fields such as quantum-enhanced sensing, imaging, and secure communication. By advancing the knowledge and techniques in this area, this research paves the way for more efficient and practical quantum light sources.

Precise Penning Trap Measurements to Aid Searches for Ultra-low Q Value Beta-decay Candidates,"The neutrino is a very light and weakly interacting particle. Nevertheless, its characteristics are of great interest to fields as diverse as particle physics and cosmology. The exact mass of the neutrino is currently unknown, but is needed to help develop a complete theoretical description of the fundamental particles that exist in nature, and to determine how the neutrino has affected the evolution of the cosmos. There are several experiments underway that aim to determine the mass of the neutrino via the beta-decay of an unstable parent isotope to a daughter isotope. In this research, the PI and team of students will identify additional isotopes that could be used for these experiments. The isotopes that the PI’s team is searching for have very low energy (Q-value) decays. The decay energies can be calculated using known energy levels in the daughter isotope and the atomic mass of the parent and daughter isotopes. However, in many cases where a so-called ultra-low Q value decay might be possible, the mass of the parent and daughter isotopes are often not known precisely enough to determine whether the decay is actually energetically allowed. The PI’s team will perform precise mass measurements to enable the identification of potential ultra-low Q value decay candidates. As part of this project, the PI will invite a cohort of six high school students to CMU each summer for a two-week summer school in which they will learn the basic concepts of experimental nuclear physics and work with undergraduate students to become involved in the team’s research projects. Weak decay processes such as nuclear beta-decay have provided significant contributions to our understanding of nuclear, atomic and particle physics. Very rare weak decay processes, such as ultra-low Q value beta-decays, which are the focus of this project, could be important for investigating the mass scale of the neutrino, and for testing theoretical descriptions of nuclear beta-decay. In this project, the PI and team of students will perform precise measurements of Q values for potential ultra-low Q value beta-decay candidates using Penning trap mass spectrometry facilities at National Laboratories, such as LEBIT at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). These decays occur between the ground state of the parent nuclide and an excited state in the daughter with an energy of <1 keV. The proposed measurements will help to identify isotopes that are potential candidates for ultra-low Q value decays. These isotopes could be used in future neutrino mass determination experiments, and are also important for enabling meaningful tests of nuclear theory for these extreme decays where atomic interference effects are expected to play a significant role. The work will be performed by Ph.D. and undergraduate students at CMU, providing opportunities for training at a world leading research facility.

BSM-PM: Precision Measurements on Ions,"One goal of this project is to measure the mass of the electron with an uncertainty of 10 parts-per-trillion, that is, with a factor of three less uncertainty than the previous best measurements. As one of the fundamental physical constants, the mass of the electron is a necessary input for many theoretical predictions in the physical sciences. For most of these the current most accurate value for the electron mass is sufficiently precise. However, there are some applications where this is not the case. In particular, predictions for the frequencies of rotation and vibration of molecular hydrogen ions (MHI, the simplest and most fundamental molecules, just two protons or deuterons bound by a single electron) require a more precise electron mass than is currently available. This is important because any discrepancy between theoretical predictions and measurements on MHI may indicate, besides the need for more precise calculations, that there is an extra force between the nuclei that is not accounted for by currently known physics (the “Standard Model” of physics). A second goal of the project is to make measurements on MHI themselves (of hyperfine structure and magnetic moments) that will complement the precise measurements of rotational and vibrational frequencies that have been made by other researchers. The measurements use devices called cryogenic Penning ion traps, in which single charged particles are suspended in a vacuum by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, and at the temperature of liquid helium. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in developing this system, then they will make the measurements and analyze the data. Students will gain research experience in a variety of technologies, some of which are used in quantum information science, preparing them for a wide range of careers in advanced STEM, The mass of the electron will be obtained using an indirect technique that combines measurements on a singly charged helium ion in a strong magnetic field, of the ratio of electron-spin-flip frequency and cyclotron frequency, with the mass of the helium ion and a theoretical value for its electronic magnetic moment. In the case of helium-4 the ion’s magnetic moment has been calculated to 0.3 parts per-trillion, so the necessary measurements are of the helium ion’s electron-spin-flip to cyclotron-frequency ratio, and its mass. The measurement of helium-4 mass will use the Penning trap system and single-ion techniques that have previously been used for many measurements of atomic mass at Florida State University. The measurements of spin-flip frequencies and hyperfine structure on helium and MHIs will use the same superconducting magnet, but will incorporate a newly-developed double Penning trap system. This will consist of a “precision trap” where the measurements of the spin-flip and cyclotron frequencies take place, and an adjacent “analysis trap”, to which the ion is transferred for detection of an electron spin-flip, together with the necessary microwave and radio-frequency feeds.

"WoU-MMA: Investigation of Extragalactic Gamma-rays - Photon Origin, Extragalactic Field Interactions and Ground-based Detection","The overarching objective of this award is to improve our understanding of extragalactic gamma-ray photons from blazars and the detection of these photons by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The project will study the highest energy electromagnetic radiation from blazars in multiple ways. Gamma-ray emitting blazars are among the most extreme astrophysical sources within the Universe, harboring energetic phenomena far beyond that attainable by terrestrial accelerators. These objects are prime laboratories for multi-messenger astrophysics, as they are hypothesized as progenitors of every messenger so far measured, including photons, neutrinos, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and gravitational waves. This multi-component project uses data from the VERITAS and prototype Schwarzschild-Couder (pSCT) telescopes to increase our understanding of gamma-ray photons from blazars by probing fundamental and observational questions about the entire gamma-ray photon path, from the creation of the photon and its interactions along its extragalactic travels, to the detection of the gamma-ray by current and future IACTs. Specific investigations focus on production of gamma rays within the blazar itself, quantification (by proxy) of the photon interactions along the extragalactic path, and improvement of gamma-ray detection by current and future IACTs. The project will help to educate and train the next generation of US gamma-ray astrophysicists, supporting a graduate student and undergraduates as they take part in cutting edge research. The team will explore ways to improve the diversity, equity and inclusion practices within large scientific collaborations such as VERITAS and the future Cerenkov Telescope Array.

Heegaard Diagrams and Holomorphic Disks,"Heegaard Floer homology is a tool for studying the topology of three- and four-dimensional objects, discovered by the PI in collaboration with Zoltan Szabo. The construction is deeply rooted in the interaction between modern mathematical methods and ideas from mathematical physics; and indeed, Heegaard Floer homology has found interactions with many other mathematical fields, including symplectic geometry, analysis, representation theory, and homological algebra. But in its essence, Heegaard Floer homology was designed to study low-dimensional phenomena, such as how knotted a circle can be in a three-dimensional manifold, how knotted two-dimensional surfaces can be in four-dimensional space, and how interesting a four-dimensional space can be. The project aims to further explore the topological applications of Heegaard Floer homology; and to further build the foundations of this invariant, both to develop computational schemes and to build a broader theoretical framework into which the theory fits in algebraically. The project will also help support graduate students studying in low-dimensional topology and related areas. The project will further develop bordered aspects of Heegaard Floer homology, specifically for dealing with its U-unspecialized versions, which are more sensitive to four-dimensional differential topology than the U-specialized versions. Parts of the project involve collaborations with other researchers, including Robert Lipshitz, Zoltan Szabo, and Dylan Thurston. Joint work with Lipshitz and Thurston sets up the algebraic background needed for this extension of weighted A-infinity algebras, their tensor products, and modules; constructed the weighted A-infinity module for the torus; weighted modules associated to three-manifolds with (bordered) torus boundary. The project aims at proving a pairing theorem, which expresses the Heegaard Floer homology module of a union of two three-manifolds glued along a torus as a suitable tensor product of the modules associated to the two manifolds. The project also aims to generalize the picture to three-manifolds whose boundary is a closed, hyperbolic surface. In a different direction, the project aims to give a description of the full (unspecialized) knot Floer complex in terms of a knot projection, as a tensor product of bimodules associated to the elementary pieces.

Collaborative Research: Fractional quantum Hall effect on noisy quantum computers,"Nontechnical Summary This award supports theoretical research on using quantum computers to investigate the fractional quantum Hall state, a quantum state of matter that can emerge when electrons are confined to two dimensions and placed in a strong magnetic field. Fractional quantum Hall states have unusual properties, for example, excitations that have a charge that is a fraction of the electron charge. These excitations may be anyons which are in a sense in between the usual classification of quantum particles as either fermions, for example electrons, or bosons, for example quanta of light. In some cases, these particles can significantly change the quantum state simply by moving two particles around each other. The properties of the fractional quantum Hall state can be discussed in terms of topological and geometrical properties. Recent advancements in quantum computing provide a unique opportunity to generate and study natural quantum phenomena in controllable quantum platforms. This project leverages these advancements to explore on available quantum computers, several challenging problems related to the quantum Hall effect, aiming to demonstrate critical signatures of topological and geometrical characteristics of fractional Hall states. This project can in this way turn current quantum computers into a laboratory for conducting experiments on fractional quantum Hall physics, allowing us to study phenomena that are difficult to access through traditional experimental methods. Through comprehensive curriculum development, the project seeks to integrate quantum computing concepts throughout undergraduate education and train a new generation of students who are proficient in using quantum computing resources. The project's outreach and educational initiatives will create new resources to showcase the application of quantum computers in addressing real-world physics problems. These materials will mainly target high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds, aiming to boost student enrollment and promote diversity in the future workforce. Technical Summary This award supports research on using existing noisy quantum computers as synthetic experimental platforms to investigate various phenomena in quantum Hall systems. The project is focused on three thrusts: (a) Designing a quantum circuit for simulating braiding and verifying the quasihole statistics for non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states. (b) Implementing nonequilibrium quantum quenches that probe the bosonic and fermionic collective neutral modes of the Moore-Read state on the quantum computer. (c) Developing and running quantum algorithms that measure the Hall viscosity of the Laughlin state and probe its robustness to disorder. This project enables the investigation of novel topological and geometric characteristics of fractional Hall states using noisy quantum computers. Quantum algorithms will be created and implemented to generate complex ground states and perform adiabatic and nonadiabatic quantum evolution. The PIs will use a general theoretical framework based on quasi-one-dimensional models of fractional quantum Hall states obtained from Landau orbitals in a spatially anisotropic cylinder. This requires reduced registers to use physical qubits efficiently, and provides efficient variational circuit architectures for implementing the three thrusts above. Additionally, the project includes an education program that focuses on curriculum development to incorporate quantum computing modules for solving physical problems into undergraduate-level physical chemistry, solid state, and quantum mechanics courses. There will also be outreach presentations to high-school students and underrepresented undergraduate students through the NSF Center for Research Excellence in Science and Technology at the City College of New York.

Equipment: MRI: Track 1 Acquisition of Instrumentation to Upgrade a Telescope for Research and Training,"The Dark Sky Observatory (DSO) at Appalachian State University maintains a 32-inch diameter telescope used by faculty, students, and collaborators in the study of comets, the color and brightness characterization of nearby stars, binary stars (stars in orbiting pairs), chemically peculiar stars, and the eclipse of distant stars by asteroids in our solar system. The primary strength of this telescope is the ability to carry out projects that require rapid, repeated measurements over long timescales, like the study of activity in the atmospheres of young solar-like stars, or the evolution of cometary bodies entering the inner solar system. Much of the current instrumentation, however, is either limited by age or design. This project will upgrade the telescope’s imaging and spectroscopic capabilities and convert them to a more modern control system. This will provide a platform for more varied projects for Appalachian State undergraduate students pursuing careers in astronomy, both observational programs and activities focused on instrumentation. Small telescopes fill an important niche in modern astronomy due in no small part to their ability to dedicate significant blocks of time to projects/targets such as monitoring campaigns, observations requiring high cadence, discovery follow up, and large surveys. In this regard, the 32-inch telescope at the Dark Sky Observatory at Appalachian State University, and its instruments, have been remarkably successful over the decades. To continue this legacy in the modern era, this project will provide a new high-QE CCD camera to upgrade the primary spectrograph, a fiber-optic bundle to move the mini-echelle spectrograph to a bench-mount configuration, a new imaging camera and filters with wider field of view, a blue sensitive camera with filter wheel and filters to be used in the study of comets, and an upgrade to the telescope control system including absolute encoders. Together, these improvements will greatly enhance the capabilities of the telescope, as well as provide new tools for the faculty, students, and collaborators. The new spectrograph also will enable a time-exchange program with the University of the Free State (UFS) and Boyden Observatory in South Africa, allowing astronomers and their students at both locales access to both hemispheres. In addition, this project will enable the investigators to open 10% of the available spectroscopic queue (190-200 nights per year, with roughly 70% usable) to the broader astronomical community.

REDWOODS: A hybrid wavefront sensor / science camera to demonstrate extreme exoplanet imaging at Lick observatory,"Over 5000 exoplanets have been discovered to date, but only a handful of these exoplanets have been directly imaged. Direct imaging requires detecting the exoplanet’s light despite the glare of its host star, but the exoplanet is millions to billions of times fainter than than its host star. Exoplanets that have been directly imaged so far are large and bright like Jupiter. Detecting Earth-like exoplanets that could have life on their surface is the next goal, but this requires instruments that are at least 100 times more sensitive. The investigators will test new technologies designed to bridge this gap. This testing will take place on the Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory in California. In addition, the team will engage undergraduate summer students from underrepresented groups to work on this project, and they will develop educational programs with local high schools. The main factor currently limiting exoplanet imaging instrument sensitivity is residual “speckle” noise, which limits exoplanetary signal detection in science images. Speckles originate from a combination of (1) errors left over after an adaptive optics (AO) system has made an initial correction of the atmospheric turbulence, and (2) imperfections in the optical surfaces from the telescope and instrument. This program will implement a new pathfinder wavefront sensing technology at Lick Observatory on the Shane telescope’s AO system (ShaneAO) called the Fast Atmospheric Self-coherent camera Technique (FAST), designed to overcome this speckle noise limit. This project to implement FAST at ShaneAO is called Real-time Exoplanet Direct imager via Wavefront control Of Optical DefectS (REDWOODS). REDWOODS is a focal plane wavefront sensor (WFS) and coronagraphic imager that will demonstrate the technology needed to enable new exoplanet imaging science on future 30m-class telescopes. REDWOODS will also enable a simultaneous Z-H band Pyramid WFS, demonstrating new capabilities of this WFS technology. This project will engage undergraduate summer students to work on REDWOODS, which will contribute to the Cal-Bridge Program, a program to increase PhDs amongst underrepresented groups within California’s public university systems.

Specifically, they will map the parameter space governing rotational turbulence, integrating complex factors such as stellar rotation profiles and buoyancy frequencies. The project further aims to incorporate the influence of convective zones on differential rotation, a factor currently overlooked in existing models. These innovations will culminate in a new generation of rotational mixing models, implemented and validated within the MESA framework.

Collaborative Research: The Seismic Technique for Accurate White Dwarf Parameters,"A detailed understanding of white dwarf stars is important for a range of astrophysical questions, from post-main sequence exoplanet habitability to Type Ia supernova cosmology. Successful inference in these areas is limited by our knowledge of white dwarf properties. White dwarf masses and effective temperatures are most commonly estimated with the so-called spectroscopic technique. However, there is significant evidence that these results suffer systematic errors from incomplete physics of the stellar atmosphere models, as well as from the methods used to fit the observed absorption line profiles. The study of the vibrational modes of pulsating white dwarfs provides a way to sensitively map their interior structures. A research collaboration between the City University of New York Queens College and Penn State Scranton will apply a new “seismic technique” to bring seismic and astrometric data together to provide accurate white dwarf masses and effective temperatures. Undergraduate students will contribute to various aspects of the proposed work as part of the AstroCom NYC program, which fosters the careers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds with research and career mentoring. Classroom labs will be published and incorporated into the curriculum of the astronomy stream of the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) program at the University of Texas at Austin. FRI provides hands-on learning opportunities to first-year undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds who wish to pursue STEM careers. The need for independent methods to determine the global parameters of white dwarf stars motivates the development of a new “seismic technique” for characterizing pulsating white dwarfs. This technique combines precision measurements of white dwarf pulsation periods with Gaia parallaxes in a probability estimate of mass and effective temperature (Teff). The measured quantities of mean pulsation period spacing and absolute G-band magnitude each permit solutions that follow monotonic trends in the mass-Teff plane, but in opposing directions. Analyzed together, these values reveal a unique solution. Focusing on the interface between data and models, the seismic technique will achieve accurate measurements due to its relative simplicity compared to the line broadening physics of the common “spectroscopic technique.” Reliable uncertainties will be obtained by marginalizing over a range of potential white dwarf interior structures and interstellar extinction values.

Collaborative Research: Stray Light Control for Cosmic Explorer,"Gravitational-wave astronomy has now opened a new window to the universe, which along with conventional telescopes, significantly broadens our understanding of astrophysics and cosmology. Cosmic Explorer is a concept for a next-generation gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, enabling the detection of nearly every black-hole collision in the observable universe. To achieve the unprecedented sensitivity of this observatory, significant R&D effort needs to be invested in designs that will minimize various sources of noise. This award addresses a major noise source, namely stray light, and will produce a conceptual design for its mitigation. Specifically, this award enables a team of scientists and engineers to analyze how stray light in the interferometer’s 40km arm cavities may limit Cosmic Explorer's sensitivity and produce an initial conceptual design for the beamtube baffles. Mitigating stray light in the beamtubes is a high-priority research topic, as it directly impacts the facility design and cost.

Computing the latter starts with finding the molecular ground state because this knowledge helps compute many properties, such as their dipole moment and charge density. Since classical algorithms are computationally expensive, a tremendous academic and commercial effort has made advances in using quantum computers as an efficient future alternative. These efforts are based on the quantum version of classical bits known as qubits. However, electrons in a molecule are not qubits but rather fermions, and translating fermions into qubits is resource-intensive in computation and storage. This project aims to complete the construction of a proof-of-principle quantum computer based on fermions to determine the ground state of molecular systems. The goal is to set the groundwork for a fermionic computer that is better than classical supercomputers at finding the electronic structure of molecules, hopefully setting the stage for quantum chemistry computations that will impact industry and medicine. Along with these efforts, this project will have an educational impact by training graduate and undergraduate students in quantum science and technology. The project impacts will broaden by creating a Young Quantum Physicist Program to bring middle and high-school students, with an effort to achieve a diverse group representing society, to our labs and introduce them to the rapidly developing quantum technology. This proposal aims to leverage the latest advances in building qubit-based quantum computers using neutral atoms in optical tweezers to assemble and benchmark a new one based on fermions. This quantum computer will implement a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm called Variational Quantum Eigensolver using fermions. This implementation will find the ground state of small molecules and develop new tools and approaches to apply the algorithm to larger molecules. Obtaining this molecular ground state is the first step in calculating many properties that determine the molecules’ physics and chemistry. Starting from a degenerate fermi gas of strontium atoms, we will load a register array of 20 by 20 optical tweezers with atoms in their electronic and motional ground states. Using a second tweezer that traps particles in the excited clock state, but not those in their ground state, and another tweezer tuned on the clock transition, we will implement an effective tunneling gate through shuttling and optical pulses on this transition. A fourth tweezer will drive a Rydberg blockade on pairs of tweezers interacting in the VQE circuit. Our goal is to achieve state-of-the-art performance in all of these operations. With this toolbox, we will find the ground state of small molecules. Finally, we will apply the intuition gained in optimizing the classical-quantum algorithm for small molecules, as well as in circuit depth and measurement, to engineer an integrated algorithm for larger molecules —a simultaneously hardware-efficient and chemically-inspired VQE— possibly resorting to quantum machine learning. Most importantly, the goal at the end of the project is to establish a roadmap for scalability and achieving optimizations of fermionic quantum computers based on neutral atoms beyond the capacity of classical computers.

Exploring String Theory with and without Supersymmetry,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Savdeep Sethi at the University of Chicago. The microscopic structure of space and time are one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch? What is the nature of dark energy? In order to answer such basic questions about the physics of our universe, we need a quantum theory of gravity. String theory remains our leading candidate for such a theory. In his research, Professor Sethi aims to explore the physics of string theories both with and without a remarkable structure called supersymmetry. This research program has concomitant broader impacts in four areas. The first comes from providing research opportunities for undergraduates, including continued participation in the Summer REU Opportunities for Minorities and Women program at the University of Chicago, and through direct research opportunities. The second is promoting equity by organizing conferences like the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics. The third is through public outreach programs like the Life Long Learning program. The final aspect involves improving interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, through direct collaboration and by organizing workshops. The research goals center on several broad topics. The first is exploring the three known non-supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions. The specific goal is investigating the space-time potential energy and understanding the nature of its critical points. This potential is an ingredient in recently constructed models that provide laboratories for exploring holography without supersymmetry. The second set of questions involve supersymmetry in differing ways: the first is to explore more deeply quantum field theories deformed by irrelevant operators. The second is to develop a symbolic computation package that can generate supersymmetric Lagrangians with higher derivative couplings. The third is to study the moduli space of compactified field theory with the aim of computing partition functions via localization. The fourth direction is to finally unravel the complete set of constraints imposed by maximal supersymmetry in field theory and supergravity. The final topic is to connect the program in mathematics to classify Fano four-folds to M-theory AdS flux solutions in three dimensions.

Frontiers of Cold Atom Theory,"Ultracold gasses form our most versatile platform for studying quantum mechanics: By combining basic building blocks scientists are able to produce complicated quantum systems that are used to test hypotheses about the emergent behavior of interacting quantum systems. This research program is aimed at expanding the range of physics which can be studied through these cold gas experiments. The goal is then to apply this knowledge to the development/understanding of new quantum materials and new quantum technology. Graduate student training is integral to the program and the participants will become experts in this quantum technology. The research program also contains an education component aimed at improving physics education for students in life sciences and those who are pursuing health careers. The research program is organized around three questions: (1) How does one controllably create highly entangled quantum states of matter? (2) What are the emergent properties of strongly interacting quantum systems? (3) What aspects of fundamental physics can be explored through cold gas experiments? Sophisticated numerical techniques, such as the density matrix renormalization group, will be used to model various scenarios. The researchers will develop new approaches to state preparation, explore the properties of quantum simulators of strongly correlated physics, and build tools for experimentally realizing lattice gauge theories.

Gravitational Wave Searches for Heavier Black Hole Binaries and Gamma-Ray Pulsars,"NSF’s LIGO observatories have produced outstanding scientific discoveries, including the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015, a spectacular “multi-messenger” astronomical event in 2017, and many tests of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The LIGO observatories have been improved and more data has been collected, now coordinated with the Virgo observatory in Europe and the KAGRA observatory in Japan. As of mid-2024, about 200 significant gravitational-wave events have been detected. The vast majority of those have been from merging black holes with masses up to about 80 times the mass of our Sun. This award supports two special projects seeking new types of gravitational-wave signals that may be hiding in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) data. The first project aims to detect merging black holes much heavier than any seen so far, using more accurate signal models that include higher frequency components. The second project is to search for gravitational waves from rapidly spinning neutron stars which have been identified as gamma-ray pulsars by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission, but which are not currently included in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA searches. Both projects have technical challenges that must be overcome and will be led by graduate students, who will gain scientific expertise and analysis skills while supported by this award. Either project could also lead to the next big gravitational wave discovery, expanding our knowledge of compact stars and black holes in the Universe. This award also supports observing operations including real-time data analysis and rapid checks so that reliable candidate events can be quickly communicated to astronomers, to enable rapid follow-up observations of new multi-messenger events. It also supports publishing a wide range of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA science results along with outreach and engagement, sharing scientific research concepts and results with high-school students and the general public. This award supports a research program with multiple goals: to expand the gravitational-wave (GW) discovery space by developing searches for distinctive signals that are not being adequately covered by current LVK collaboration searches; to maintain and optimize low-latency searches and rapid response so that astronomers have the best chance to catch and study multi-messenger GW events; and to ensure that GW science results are published and shared with the public, including students. Two grad-student-led projects address the first goal. In one project, the PyCBC data analysis pipeline will be adapted to use templates calculated from the SEOBNRv5PHM waveform model, with a total mass between 100 and 1500 solar masses and a mass range of up to 20. The template bank will be constructed using stochastic methods. The plus and cross polarizations, including higher-order modes, will be stored and filtered separately, and a non-parametric model of the noise will be developed to optimize the search efficiency for short, broadband signals. The second project will target continuous-wave GW emissions from pulsars in the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of Gamma-ray Pulsars (3PC). Different gamma-ray emission models will be used to perform a population analysis of the pulsars in 3PC which are currently included in LVK targeted searches, using the CWInPy software package. The available timing information for other pulsars in 3PC will be studied to determine which ones are suitable for additional time-domain targeted searches using LVK data and CWInPy. Either of these projects could lead to a breakthrough discovery of a currently unseen GW source. Addressing the second goal, this award supports the maintenance, optimization, and operation of the PyCBC Live software for low-latency searches during the O4 observing run, real-time monitoring and rapid response team handling of GW event candidates, and preparations for the future O5 run. Addressing the third goal, it supports contributions to producing specific LVK papers as well as the maintenance of collaboration software tools to plan, track, and publish the LVK’s science results. It also supports sharing scientific research concepts and results with school-age students through direct engagement and with the general public through online summaries of scientific findings.

Theoretical Calculations for Particle Physics at Hadron Colliders,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Nikolaos Kidonakis and Marco Guzzi at Kennesaw State University. The research project is in theoretical particle physics, and it is relevant to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is currently the highest-energy particle collider in the world, and to future colliders. By colliding protons at higher energies than have ever been previously explored, physicists expect to learn more about the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions. The research involves theoretical calculations that are sufficiently precise and accurate to make meaningful comparisons with data from the LHC. The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle that has been discovered and it has unique properties, and thus it is of central importance for the physics program at the LHC. The Higgs boson is involved in the mechanism for mass generation, and the determination of its properties is a very high priority. Thus, theoretical predictions of the production rates for these particles is crucial for further progress in our field. Furthermore, an improved description of the structure of the proton is essential for understanding the details of proton-proton collisions. The research will involve state-of-the-art calculations that will improve theoretical predictions for the production of top quarks, Higgs and W, Z bosons, and other particles, it will advance our knowledge of the strong interactions, and it will improve the description of the structure of the proton. The project will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of elementary particles and their interactions, and the search for new physics, thereby serving the NSF mission of promoting the progress of science. The research findings will be widely disseminated through publication in refereed journals and presentations in international conferences. This project will also have significant broader impacts. It will involve students as well as a postdoctoral researcher in fundamental research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists in this field. Outreach activities in the wider community will promote knowledge of physics to the public. More technically, the research project will implement formalisms that can improve theoretical predictions of higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections for a large number of processes at the LHC and future colliders as well as the determination of parton distribution functions (PDF) in the proton. Higher-order perturbative calculations of QCD and electroweak corrections as well as resummations of soft-gluon and collinear contributions will be performed for processes involving top quarks, such as top-antitop pair production, single-top production, production of top-antitop pairs in association with Z bosons and Higgs bosons, and other processes in the Standard Model and in models of new physics. Calculations of soft-gluon corrections to cross sections and differential distributions for these processes will be performed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO). An improved calculation of the massive cusp anomalous dimension, which controls the infrared behavior of QCD scattering amplitudes, will also be performed at four loops. Moreover, the CTEQ global PDF analysis will be extended to the next generation which is based on a variety of new measurements from the LHC Run 2 and Run 3. The PDF will be determined at NNLO in QCD using an amended version of the factorization theorem in proton collisions for selected processes, and a new strategy will be devised to account for theoretical uncertainties in the global analysis and flexible PDF parametrizations. Moreover, the impact of partial N3LO contributions to DGLAP evolution will be studied, and the default CTEQ factorization scheme for heavy-flavor treatment in DIS processes will be extended to N3LO in QCD using the information currently available in the literature.

Building Precise Gravitational Wave Models with Black Hole Perturbation Theory,"This award will support and extend ongoing research on the dynamics of binary systems in general relativity, and into characterizing the gravitational waves that such binaries produce. The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of how black holes in binary systems interact with one another, and how their interactions affect the gravitational waves they produce. This work will thus provide a foundation for further observational probes of the dynamics of black holes and ultra-strong gravity. This award will also support “sonifications” of gravitational wave signals and visualizations of the sources that produce these waves, using audio to illustrate how gravitational waves encode source information, as well as online tools for studying the behavior of orbits of spinning black holes. The core work supported by this award will use black hole perturbation theory (BHPT), an approach that works well modeling binaries in the small mass ratio limit when a binary can be regarded as a small object orbiting a large black hole. One planned project will continue investigating the endpoint of binary black hole coalescence in this limit. Past work studying this problem for circular orbit geometries significantly clarified how the spectrum of final mode excitation depends on coalescence geometry. The team's current work examines the role eccentricity plays in this process, examining how well a system’s eccentricity as it enters the final merger can be discerned from its late gravitational-wave spectrum. Other projects include continuing investigations of gravitational waves produced by spinning bodies orbiting black holes, the continuation of work to develop surrogate binary black hole models based on the small mass-ratio limit, as well as continuing ongoing development of open-source tools for producing fast waveforms in the small mass-ratio limit. These projects grew from work that constituted major portions of the Ph.D. theses of graduate students supported by a prior NSF award.

WoU-MMA: Continuous Gravitational Waves: from Searching to Observing,"Multimessenger astrophysics (MMA) combines different means of observation such as electromagnetic and gravitational waves (GWs), as seen in the 2017 LIGO-Virgo observation of a binary neutron star inspiral associated with a gamma-ray burst, followed by multiple observations of an electromagnetic counterpart. A promising MMA target is the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Scorpius X-1, long studied in X-ray, radio, and optical. This binary star system consists of a neutron star, an extremely dense object more massive than the sun and the size of a city, together with a less massive star, the outer layers of which are being pulled onto the neutron star by its gravity. The neutron star is believed to be spinning tens to hundreds of times a second and is one of the most promising sources of long-lived gravitational waves. The goal of this project is to detect or further constrain those waves, which will broaden the field of Gravitational Wave Astronomy beyond the short-lived GW signals observed so far by LIGO and Virgo. This project will involve faculty, scientific staff, and students of the Rochester Institute of Technology, who will conduct the most sensitive search ever for GWs from Sco X-1 using data from the fourth and fifth observing runs of the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA detectors, probing the range of plausible signal strengths over a wide range of frequencies, and possibly leading to the first observation of continuous gravitational waves. The program will also be extended by expanding the search to other LMXBs, improving the validation of potential detections, and transitioning from a mode of searching all the data of a run at once to ongoing incremental observations. The search for GWs from Sco X-1 is considered a ""highest priority"" by the LIGO scientific collaboration, and this grant will be instrumental in maximizing its success.

NSF-BSF: CDS&E: Tensor Train methods for Quantum Impurity Solvers,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award is made on a joint US-Israeli NSF-BSF. It supports research aimed to develop computational techniques for studying quantum impurity models. These models are important for understanding small, strongly interacting, quantum systems that are coupled to larger environments, such as a single atom inside a host material or a quantum dot interacting with surrounding particles. Quantum impurities can display various interesting behaviors, including changes in their electrical or magnetic properties, depending on their environment. Most quantum impurity models are too complicated to solve with traditional mathematical approaches, particularly when they involve numerous interacting parts and lack symmetrical structure. The goal of this project is to advance the numerical tools we have available to tackle these complex systems and gain a deeper insight into their properties. Quantum impurity models are also key components of more sophisticated techniques to calculate the electronic properties of materials and models of materials. Quantum impurity solvers resulting from this international collaboration may enable new techniques for calculating electronic properties of materials, particularly those involving correlated electron motion resulting from strong interactions. Numerical tools produced by this project will be made widely available to the community. The project supports the training of graduate students in computational and theoretical materials research. Science presentations for the general public will be developed as part of a Saturday Morning Physics outreach activity to the general public. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports the development of quantum impurity solvers for a variety of purposes. Quantum Impurity Solvers are numerical algorithms that capture the ‘entanglement’ or ‘correlation’ of confined quantum systems consisting of a few strongly interacting orbitals coupled to an environment. They are important both in their own right in applications ranging from quantum transport to Kondo physics, and in the context of embedding theories such as the dynamical mean field and self-energy embedding theories. The lack of accurate and generic quantum impurity solvers for impurities with general off-diagonal interactions and impurity-bath hybridization is one of the main theoretical limitations in the accurate simulation of quantum many-body systems. This joint US–Israeli NSF-BSF project will explore novel data-science-inspired tensor contraction and compression schemes for quantum impurity solvers, building on a long-standing collaboration between the US and the Israeli groups, with the aim of providing a new generation of quantum impurity solvers that provide access to areas of parameter space that are currently inaccessible. Quantum impurity solvers resulting from this international collaboration may enable new techniques for calculating electronic properties of materials, particularly those involving correlated electron motion resulting from strong interactions.

REU Site: Undergraduate Research in Physics at the University of South Carolina,"This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of South Carolina. The site engages ten undergraduate students per year for ten weeks working in various research projects, which include particle, nuclear, condensed matter, theoretical and computational physics. A wide range of projects are available from faculty mentors that involve the undergraduates in state-of-the-art research and there are substantial facilities. By participating in high level scientific research, students will have an understanding of this area. Whether they choose to continue in physics or a related technical field, or choose to move to a different area, bright students making good choices early in their careers is in the national interest. Students will do research on how quantum gravity can be tested with high precision atomic clocks, of how to change the properties and functions of materials that are exposed to pulsed or oscillating external fields, various nanotechnology projects related to nanomanufacturing and magnetic-field directed self-assembly, creation of programmable meta-materials and memresistor fabrication as well as hybrid nanostructures, studying atomic models using scanning tunneling microscopes and x-ray measurements, studies of muonic hydrogen and studying physics beyond the standard model in charmed meson and baryon decays. This experience will be supplemented by numerous group activities including weekly presentations and day trips. Social activities, both organized and spontaneous, will enrich this undergraduate research experience.

Collaborative Research: Manipulating the Thermal Properties of Two-Dimensional Materials Through Interface Structure and Chemistry,"Nontechnical Description Any owner of a mobile phone or laptop computer knows how hot they can get when being used. This is why electronic devices are engineered to shed heat and reduce the temperature under operation. This problem is critical at the nanoscale, where it is necessary to control thermal conduction at boundaries between different materials and components. Consider two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, which have shown great promise. These consist of layers of atoms that are tightly bound in the plane and weakly bound between layers. If heat cannot be efficiently transported between layers, there would be significant limits to the use of 2D materials in next generation electronics. On the other hand, a strong thermal boundary could provide the potential for remarkable materials with thermal isolation better than air. The need to understand and control thermal boundary conductance at 2D-2D interfaces and between 2D and bulk materials motivates this project. Investigators will manipulate the thermal properties of 2D materials through changes in their interface structure and chemistry. Investigators will study how to control physical coupling and the effect of novel heat transfer mechanisms. An integral part of this project will be to develop experiential education programs for underrepresented students at the University of Texas at Dallas, the Carnegie Institute of Washington, and local high schools and community colleges. The researchers will work with local museums to develop new artwork conservation programs using optical techniques such as Raman spectroscopy. Technical Description A major gap in the present knowledge of thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is how it can be manipulated by changing the structure of 2D-2D and 2D-bulk interfaces. As these interfaces are often set when the sample is fabricated, only a subset of structure-property relationships has been investigated, and often across disparate samples subject to the variation common to 2D materials. This project is applying extreme pressure within a diamond anvil cell as a new technique for broadly changing the structure of the same interface while measuring the TBC. This is allowing researchers to decode fundamental knowledge on the structure-property relationships for the TBC while also gaining insights into practical pathways for manipulating the thermal properties of 2D materials and thermal limitations of 2D devices. Specific structural and chemical changes at the interface include (1) the increase of physical coupling, (2) the transition from nonbonded to bonded chemistry, and (3) the onset of new phononic and nonphononic heat transfer mechanisms. Raman spectroscopy at optical wavelengths is being used to simultaneously characterize the interface and measure the TBC. The measurements are backed by first-principles modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the TBC, these models are allowing researchers to identify renormalizations of the phonon dispersion and scattering, which can affect many phonon-limited areas of energy transport and conversion in 2D materials.

Non-perturbative studies of electron-lattice interactions in quantum materials,"Nontechnical Summary: Quantum materials represent a diverse class of systems at the forefront of materials research. These materials host several novel and highly tunable states of matter, each with transformative potential across different science and technology sectors. Modeling these systems is incredibly challenging, however, and often requires the development and use of advanced computational methods. This project focuses on performing state-of-the-art numerical simulations of quantum materials where the electrons interact strongly with the motion of the atoms. While these interactions are believed to play a key role in different families of quantum materials, previous numerical studies have often concentrated on oversimplified models with unrealistic parameters primarily for various technical reasons. This aspect has generally prevented the scientific community from obtaining definitive answers to how these interactions influence the properties of different materials. The PI’s team will leverage new simulation capabilities to perform detailed simulations of different quantum materials while including realistic descriptions of the interactions between the electrons and lattice of atoms that form the material. The team will also provide predictions for various spectroscopic measurements to guide future experiments on these materials. Combined, this project will help identify organizing principles for quantum materials and facilitate their use in future scientific and technological applications. This project will also broaden participation in computational science and provide training in cutting-edge computational methods to enhance the scientific workforce. For example, the PI’s team will develop new training materials and open-source codes for performing numerical simulations of quantum materials, which will be disseminated in partnership with the University of Tennessee’s Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing, an NSF MRSEC center. Finally, the PI will continue existing efforts aimed at increasing opportunities for underrepresented minorities in physics through partnerships with the APS Bridge and Nuclear Physics in Eastern Tennessee programs. Technical Summary: Understanding the properties of strongly correlated quantum materials is a forefront challenge for the scientific community. These materials often host strong electron-electron and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, which produce correlated electron liquids that defy theoretical descriptions based on single-particle theories. Modeling their behavior often requires nonperturbative numerical methods; however, addressing realistic e-ph interactions remains as a key challenge. This project addresses this problem by applying state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods to study broad classes of models for quantum materials hosting strong e-ph interactions, leveraging a new open-source implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) algorithm developed by the PI’s group. This code can simulate a broad class of Hamiltonians and uses hybrid Monte Carlo methods to sample the phonon fields efficiently and overcome the long autocorrelation times typically associated with these simulations. The PI and his team will use these capabilities to perform numerically exact simulations of models beyond the canonical Holstein model with physically realistic descriptions of the phonon subsystem. Specifically, they will study how the e-ph coupling influences the emergent properties of materials ranging from unconventional superconductors to kagome metals to graphene-derived systems. They will also predict spectroscopic measurements on such systems to guide experimental studies and provide crucial validation of their results. A particular focus for this project is on generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like e-ph interactions, where the atomic motion couples the electron’s kinetic energy via a modulation of the overlap integral. This interaction has been linked to novel phenomena ranging from mobile (bi)polarons, high-temperature superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, novel charge or bond orders, and topological states of matter. This project will also broaden participation in computational science and provide training in cutting-edge computational methods to enhance the scientific workforce. For example, the PI’s team will develop new training materials and open-source codes for performing numerical simulations of quantum materials, which will be disseminated in partnership with the University of Tennessee’s Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing, an NSF MRSEC center.

Problems in Regularity Theory of Partial Differential Equations,"This project focuses on understanding certain types of partial differential equations (PDE) commonly encountered in physics and engineering, such as those governing elasticity and conductivity. When we study how materials deform under stress or conduct electricity, we often use equations to describe these phenomena. However, some equations don't behave smoothly, especially when dealing with high contrast materials or complex shapes. These situations can lead to equations that are much harder to analyze, and traditional methods may not work. Another area of study is equations from fluid dynamics. Understanding these questions is crucial for practical applications like designing airplanes or predicting weather patterns, and it also inspires new ideas in mathematics and statistics. Finally, the Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in kinetic equations, which describe how particles move and interact in systems like nuclear fusion experiments. By studying these equations, scientists hope to improve our understanding of how plasmas behave in extreme conditions, such as inside a tokamak. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. As part of this project, the PI will carry out research closely related to the aforementioned topics and will attempt to address some of the open problems in these areas. The focus will be on several projects that can be gathered into three main topical areas. First, the project will develop new methods to study elliptic equations arising in composite materials (e.g., elasticity problems, conductivity problems). The PI is particularly interested in the blowup behaviors of solutions to PDE in domains with Lipschitz inclusions, equations involving the p-Laplacian, and the insulated problem for the Lamé system. Second, the project will explore the free boundary problem involving an incompressible fluid permeating a porous medium, often referred to as the one-phase Muskat problem. The focus will be on investigating the regularity of solutions to the two- and three-dimensional one-phase Muskat problem in the whole space, as well as on exploring the short-term and long-term smoothing effects of these solutions. Finally, the project will investigate boundary regularity of linear kinetic equations as well as the stability and global well-posedness of nonlinear kinetic equations, including the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system and the spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations in general domains.

"NSF-BSF Application: Research on Reaction between H2-H2O Fluid and Silicate, and Implications for Uranus and Neptune","The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, & Neptune) contain more than 99% of the mass in the solar system except for the Sun. However, our understanding of the composition and the interior of these planets is still limited. While Jupiter and Saturn contain mainly hydrogen (H) and helium (He), Uranus and Neptune have thinner H-He envelopes, making them key to understand the structure and the composition below the gas envelope in the context of planet formation and origins of the solar system. This project will systematically map fluid-silicate interactions over an array of pressure, temperature, and H2/(H2+H2O) ranges, and then couple the experimental results with interior evolution models to understand the formation of Uranus and Neptune. This project will provide a unique collaborative research opportunity between mineral physics and planet evolution theory for an undergraduate researcher and a postdoctoral researcher, training early career scientists in multi-disciplinary research that is particularly relevant to exo-planet science. Recent pilot experiments found that H2/H2O ratio influences fluid-silicate reactions and therefore this ratio is key for understanding the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. Even though the pressure expected for the region (10–200 GPa) is accessible in experiments, little is known about the behavior of materials in various H2-H2O rich conditions. This project will experimentally measure reactions between H2-H2O fluid and silicates at high pressure -temperature conditions and will determine how the metallization of hydrogen and the superionicity of H2O above 100 GPa can change the fluid–silicate reaction. The experimental results will be coupled with planetary interior evolution models to characterize the composition profiles and thermal evolution of Uranus and Neptune.

Quantum Stereodynamics of Cold Molecular Collisions,"The transformation from reactants to products in a chemical reaction is the result of billions of collisions between the reactant molecules. At normal temperatures, these collisions occur randomly in arbitrary orientations, and as such, one cannot exert any control over this process. However, as the temperature is reduced, quantum effects begin to emerge and a quantum mechanical treatment is necessary to understand the collisions. In this regime, small perturbations introduced by external electric or magnetic fields can alter the reactants’ interactions and the reaction outcome. This is an emerging field of research in Physics and Chemistry, and quantum science in general, to gain fundamental understanding of atomic and molecular collisions and control their outcome. The collision outcome can also be influenced by controlling the orientation or alignment of the reactant molecules, which is a topic of this award. One can also control the collision outcome through quantum mechanical interference effects, with constructive interference along the reaction path enhancing the reaction and destructive interference suppressing it. Such quantum interference effects are important when the transformation from reactant to products involves multiple pathways. The methodologies developed as part of this award will result in computational algorithms for quantum control of chemical reactions as well as improved understanding of molecular processes in the earth’s atmosphere and astrophysical environments. The Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) technique has become a powerful tool to prepare molecules in well-defined ro-vibrational levels and magnetic projection quantum numbers. Such SARP-prepared molecules have become a testbed for the study of aligned molecular collisions allowing quantum-controlled collisions of diatomic molecules such as HD and D2 though the approach can be applied to any molecular system, including those lacking a permanent dipole-moment. The PI will undertake a detailed quantum mechanical investigation of HD+D2 collisions in light of recent experimental study of this system as well as chemical reaction between electronically excites sulfur atoms and D2 molecules. In both systems, the effect of alignment of the HD and D2 molecules will be investigated on the collision outcome. For the latter case, the effect of coupling to the lower electronic state will be investigated. Additionally, the effect of isotope substitution and quantum interference effects originating from non-adiabatic dynamics in Li+Li2 chemical reaction will be studied. The NSF award will support a postdoc and provide opportunities for undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented communities to engage in leading-edge research, contributing to future workforce development in emerging areas of quantum science. This project is jointly supported by the NSF Physics and Chemistry Divisions.

Semi-global Kuranishi Structures in Symplectic Field Theory,"Contact manifolds are a special type of space that naturally emerges in various contexts. For instance, they are used to describe the orbital paths of satellites. Taking the satellite scenario, for example, a natural question to ask is whether there are recurring orbits that a satellite can traverse. Contact homology offers a systematic way to explore the geometric features of these contact manifolds. In the satellite scenario, one can gain deep insights into all possible orbital paths of satellites by analyzing recurring satellite orbits. Contact homology has been highly successful in distinguishing different contact manifolds. This project aims to refine our understanding of contact manifolds using an enhanced approach based on contact homology. Furthermore, the PI intends to apply the techniques developed in this process to study other types of spaces beyond contact manifolds, such as spaces with symmetries. Symmetries play a crucial role in many aspects of daily life. For instance, ensuring that machine learning models treat people fairly, irrespective of their gender or race, reflects a key symmetry requirement. To address these issues, the PI will conduct an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program focused on developing symmetrical neural networks to mitigate gender and racial biases. Symplectic Field Theory, introduced two decades ago, aims to provide invariants for symplectic and contact manifolds. It encompasses essential concepts such as cylindrical contact homology, contact homology, chain homotopy types of contact differential graded algebras (dga), and linearized contact homology. The projects presented here revolve around the foundational aspects of Symplectic Field Theory. The primary challenge addressed by the Principal Investigator (PI) concerns achieving transversality while preserving symmetries to derive the desired algebraic formula. Various tools and techniques, including obstruction bundle gluing and evaluation maps for cylindrical contact homology, and semi-global Kuranishi structures for contact homology, have been introduced or employed by the PI. The project applies these tools to investigate two specific invariants: the chain homotopy type of contact dga and linearized contact homology. Furthermore, the PI has developed a new tool, the semi-global Kuranishi structure for clean intersections, which lies between obstruction bundle gluing and semi-global Kuranishi structures. This tool offers increased computational efficiency and bridges seemingly unrelated techniques. The project also aims to establish a Smith-type rank inequality related to the Floer homology of the fixed point set, contributing to the understanding of the L-space conjecture.

High-Harmonic Generation in Complex Systems,"Since the invention of the laser, the development of ever more controlled pulses of light has facilitated progress in science, technology, and medicine. As an example, light pulses with very short temporal durations allow scientists to make “movies” of how electrons and atoms move around inside molecules, for instance during chemical reactions. The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the development of attosecond pulses of light (the shortest ever made), which are produced in the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). HHG happens as a result of the interaction between an intense laser pulse and almost any nonlinear medium, and has proven to be a versatile source of short-pulse, well-controlled light in the ultraviolet (UV) and extreme UV (XUV) spectral region. This project is centered on the further development of HHG as a source of UV and XUV light, in particular in systems that are more complex than atomic gases, for which the majority of work has been done up to now. The PI and her group will work on the development of theoretical tools for simulating the HHG process and the light it generates, as well as applications of these tools to model results in collaboration with experimental colleagues. The proposed work will be relevant to open questions at the forefront of ultrafast science and will contribute to workforce development through the training of junior researchers at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The PI will continue to serve the AMO and broader physics community through service roles at the national level. The work in this project entails specific developments and applications for HHG in semi-conductor crystals, as well as for HHG in organic molecules. In crystals, the PI and her group will continue their on-going development of a versatile theory tool that is capable of describing the coupled microscopic and macroscopic dynamics of HHG in crystalline solids, through the build-up and phase matching of the HHG light. This tool is based on the coupled solutions of the semi-conductor Bloch equations and the Maxwell wave equation, and will require high-performance computing resources. The understanding and macroscopic control of the properties of HHG in crystals, similar to what is routinely done in gas-phase HHG, has been largely unexplored even though it is essential for the development of solid-state HHG as a probe of ultrafast dynamics. For example, in order to interpret features in the HHG spectrum in terms of the structure and dynamics of the host material it is necessary to know what role macroscopic effects play in shaping those features. In organic molecules, accurate calculations of HHG are extremely challenging because there are so many degrees of freedom involved. The group will use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to simulate the HHG process, with the goal of developing TDDFT as a reliable tool for molecular HHG calculations, allowing more direct comparisons between calculated and experimentally measured results.

"Collaborative Research: Construction and Deployment of a Cryogenic, Undoped CsI Scintillator at the Spallation Neutron Source within the COHERENT Experiment","Despite being the most numerous massive particle, neutrinos remain the least understood known fundamental particle. The undetermined properties of the neutrino likely connects to some of the largest open questions in modern physics such as the origin of neutrino mass, nature of dark matter, and whether there are undiscovered forces of nature. Progress resolving these open questions is slow primarily because neutrinos interact very feebly with matter. Thus, neutrino experiments are typically massive, often measured in the thousands of tons. We will build and operate a detector that will test the unknown properties of neutrinos with a small, 10-kg detector by searching for very low energy signals. A small-scale detector enables full engagement in neutrino science by students from design to data analysis. The PIs will leverage this opportunity to involve underrepresented young scientists at Florida State University, North Carolina Central University, an HBCU, and the University of South Dakota, located within an EPSCoR state and nurture their identities as early career neutrino physicists. The detector constructed under this project will measure coherent, elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) in which a low-energy (< 50 MeV) neutrino transfers a small kinetic energy to a nucleus (< 100 keV). Low-threshold detectors are critical for CEvNS measurements. We will design, construct, and deploy a cryogenic, undoped CsI scintillation detector at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as part of the COHERENT experiment. This technology has demonstrated impressive light output with potential for detection thresholds twenty times lower than the first detection of CEvNS, made by COHERENT in 2017. In the detector's baseline design, scintillation activity in a 10-kg CsI crystal will be monitored by an array of silicon photomultiplier light detectors. The detector will be housed in a low-activity copper support structure in a cryostat cooled to 40 K. The detector will be surrounded with a composite shielding to mitigate environmental gamma and neutron backgrounds along with scintillator panels to veto cosmic activity. The detector will be operating at the SNS by the end of this award. This project is co-funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), which provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs.

Enabling Cepheids and RR Lyrae science with Rubin/LSST,"A key question in astronomy is how the universe formed and changes with time. Recent observations show that stars and galaxies were born and grew quicker than expected. Other data suggest that the universe itself may be expanding faster than cosmological models predict. This program will help study these fundamental questions using the Vera Rubin telescope. The focus of this program is on Cepheids and RR Lyrae pulsating stars, which periodically change their brightness as their radius expands and contracts. The researchers will analyze the properties of these stars to understand the history of the galaxies where they are found. This program will pave the way for further studies of RR Lyrae and Cepheids with the Vera Rubin telescope. The scientific goals of this program are complemented by strong public outreach activities at the Florida State University planetarium. The main goals of this project are to enable Cepheids and RR Lyrae variables to serve as precision indicators of distance and metallicity for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Rubin telescope (Rubin/LSST). The team will achieve this objective by combining new and archival Cepheids and RR Lyrae photometric time-series in key Rubin/LSST passbands with a large library of calibrating stars, derived from spectroscopic [Fe/H] abundances and accurate parallaxes measured by Gaia. With this dataset, they will: calibrate photometric metallicity relations to derive [Fe/H] abundances for hundreds of thousands of pulsating stars detected by Rubin/LSST; calibrate Period-Luminosity-Metallicity (PLZ) and Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity (PWZ) relations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae in Rubin/LSST bands; and test these relations by studying the metallicity distribution of a sample of dwarf galaxies in the footprint of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Wide-Area Survey.

REU Site: Physics Research in the Nation's Capital,"This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the Catholic University of America (CUA). The REU site will host eight undergraduate students per year, who will spend ten weeks during the summer engaged in research topics in physics, mathematics, and engineering. The main goal of our program is to reach out to and engage young undergraduate students - who would otherwise not have the opportunity - in cutting-edge research at the exciting interface between basic research in nuclear and particle physics and applied science leveraging cutting-edge algorithmic advancements. Through guided mentorship by faculty members and interactions with other undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, undergraduates will gain hands-on laboratory experience and practical problem-solving skills in the context of scientific research by participating in real-life physics research. The program offers seminars on a wide variety of subjects, e.g., skill development, learning reinforcement, and the path to becoming a researcher including graduate school and careers in academia and beyond, and aims to recruit educate, and retain the next generation of scientists and engineers. Sophisticated detectors and instruments using nuclear physics principles are all around us and used in everyday life including MRIs (proton spin) in medical applications and gamma ray detectors in oil well logging. Instrumentation initiatives thus provide a unique education and training environment for attracting undergraduate students into the field. This REU program includes advanced nuclear physics detector design and construction that offer undergraduates meaningful engagement in state-of-the-art research projects that can be approached and explored in a short period. Research topics include nuclear and particle physics experiments, data analyses, artificial intelligence for detector design, investigating particle identification and novel focusing lenses for particle detectors, and detector construction projects that are carried out on campus. CUA has a unique position because of its proximity to and collaborations with flagship national laboratories and strong expertise in materials. The REU program will build on CUA's demonstrated experience of the mutually beneficial involvement of undergraduate students in cutting edge research projects, including some that have led to the successful construction of detectors. Students will have the opportunity to give oral presentations and participate in a poster session on the final day of the program, and funding will be provided to all students to subsequently present their work at a relevant national or regional conference.

Collaborative Research: NSF BSF: Disk Formation over Cosmic Time,"Most of the stars that make up our home galaxy, the Milky Way, are arranged in the shape of a rotating disk. Many other galaxies in the universe today are also shaped like disks. However, when astronomers look back in time with large telescopes, they see that the fraction of galaxies that are disks goes down. The very first galaxies we have seen in the primordial universe are not disks. The investigators will use simulations that model the formation of galaxies, from the earliest times to today. They will explore when and how galaxies begin to take the shape of disks to understand the reasons why. The investigators will also compare their simulations to observations of stars in the Milky Way and distant galaxies to help us understand how disk galaxies came to be. The research program will support the education and training of PhD students, increasing their understanding of physics, data science, scientific visualization, and programming. The investigators will also mentor a diverse population of undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM fields. The investigators will study the physics that underpins galaxy disk formation using a large set of zoom cosmological simulations with Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) galaxy formation physics. They will study the connection and causal correlations between thin and thick disks: Do thin disks emerge first in cosmic history, with thick disks constituting a descendant, heated population? Or, are thin disks a relatively recent phenomenon, with thick disks a natural outcome of high-redshift galaxy formation? The investigators will explore the degree to which galaxy potentials becoming centrally concentrated over time may help enable galaxies to “spin up,” and track how the disordered interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies at early times transitions to more ordered, thin-disk-dominated populations at late times. A crucial component of this work will be to understand the astrophysics that regulates galactic disk formation as a means of understanding what may be missing in models that do not produce disks with the correct frequency and character to match observations. The simulations will allow the investigators to explore connections between the baryon cycle and morphological structure. The investigators will inform deep-field imaging and velocity-field studies of galaxy disk “settling” as well as local studies with surveys including MaNGA, the Local Volume Mapper, GALAH, and Gaia.

Collaborative Research: Combining Galaxy and Cosmic Microwave Background Surveys for Precise and Robust Constraints on Cosmology,"The distribution of matter throughout the cosmos carries information about the origin, future, and composition of the Universe. However, obtaining high-precision measurements of the matter distribution is challenging: most of the matter is in the form of invisible dark matter, making it impossible to observe directly. Instead, techniques such as gravitational lensing – the bending of light by gravity – must be used to infer where the matter is. With this research program, scientists at the University of Hawaii and the University of Chicago will analyze four different and highly complementary probes of the matter distribution from state-of-the-art astronomical surveys to obtain precise and unbiased constraints on the properties of the Universe. The team will use measurements of galaxy positions and gravitational lensing of galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), measurements of gravitational lensing of light from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and finally, measurements from SPT and ACT of the scattering of CMB light with electrons. By analyzing these complementary probes in concert, the team will reduce uncertainties on the properties of the Universe, minimize potential biases in their constraints, and obtain a more complete picture of the matter distribution. This award will additionally support development of new teaching modules designed to give high school and undergraduate students the opportunity to learn from real data and gain hands-on experience in data science. Statistics of the matter distribution are predicted by the cosmological constant and cold dark matter (LCDM) model, and comparing these predictions to observations is a key goal of current and future cosmic surveys. Recently, measurements of the late-time matter distribution from galaxy surveys have shown hints of disagreement with extrapolations of early-Universe measurements that assume LCDM. This disagreement could result from fundamental problems with LCDM, or from systematic uncertainties impacting the measurements. Using new data from DES, SPT, and ACT, the team will measure and analyze cross-correlations between CMB lensing, galaxy positions, galaxy lensing, and the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect in order to perform a definitive assessment of tension with LCDM, test alternative cosmological models, and enable improved constraints with future surveys. The broader impacts of the proposal will be to provide training in data science to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and to increase public engagement with astronomical surveys. The PIs will develop a set of new teaching tools based on Python notebooks that give high school and undergraduate students the opportunity to learn from real data. These teaching tools will be implemented in classrooms in Honolulu and Chicago.

Neutron Stars and Gravitational Waves from LIGO to Cosmic Explorer,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. NSF LIGO’s detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in coincidence with electromagnetic signals from gamma-rays to radio opened a window into the interiors of neutron stars. These stars contain matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang. Long-lived continuous gravitational waves associated with pulsars and supernova remnants and short bursts associated with gamma-ray flares of highly magnetized neutron stars, once detected, will yield even more information on neutron star interiors. The planned Cosmic Explorer detector will push the frontiers forward by enabling detection of many neutron star mergers and probably a variety of other signals. The science goals of this award are to conduct cutting edge searches for these novel signals and improve the extraction of astrophysical information from present and future signals. This award supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic Serving Institution. Students will be trained not only in gravitational physics, data analysis, and astrophysics, but in cutting edge computational and statistical techniques that are transferable to many areas of science and technology. This award also supports public outreach through the Cosmic Explorer web site. The main research activity of this award is searches for continuous gravitational waves from young neutron stars, including r-mode oscillations of known pulsars as well as searches of supernova remnants and other likely locations of non-pulsing neutron stars. This award also contributes to searches for a variety of signals including neutron star binary mergers and bursts associated with magnetar flares and to the extraction of astrophysical information from detections present and future. In preparation for the detection of non-merger signals the award supports exploration of detectability and what can be learned about neutron stars now and in the era of Cosmic Explorer.

REU Site: Pioneering the Future at the Unique Compact X-ray Free Electron Laser Facility,"The Compact X-ray Free Electron Laser Facility at Arizona State University features two groundbreaking, first-of-their-kind pulsed X-ray sources. This new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site offers a unique opportunity for undergraduate students from diverse disciplines across the U.S. to contribute to the design, construction, and commissioning of these cutting-edge X-ray sources. Participants will also engage in the first scientific experiments exploring applications in quantum materials, biochemistry, atomic and molecular science, optical science, and medicine. This program aims to increase the national STEM talent pool by recruiting participants from a broad range of institutions, including minority-serving institutions, local community colleges, and tribal colleges. Beyond the research experience, students will attend project management meetings and participate in professional development workshops and scientific seminars. By the conclusion of the program, participants will have developed critical skills, gained confidence, and contributed to advancing the field, all while preparing for advanced studies and careers in STEM. Over the course of a 10-week summer program, participants in this REU Site will gain hands-on experience constructing and commissioning novel X-ray sources and planning and executing scientific experiments. The program’s educational goal is to develop independent researchers who can apply scientific principles across various disciplines. Due to the diversity of expertise available among faculty mentors, students will be recruited from fields including physics, engineering, computer science, chemistry, and biology. Science questions increasingly focus on understanding events, changes, and structures at the smallest atomic scales across a wide range of disciplines. The two Compact X-ray Light Sources produce sub-femtosecond X-ray pulses, which enable advanced studies to directly observe, manipulate, and control quantum dynamics in complex materials, molecules, and interfaces. These capabilities will reveal novel biological processes, enable new energy-efficient technologies, and decode quantum behavior that can drive new computing methods and novel materials. Students will work on projects aligned with their interests, contributing to the advancement of these multidisciplinary X-ray sources and the broader field of ultrafast X-ray science. They will also gain valuable insights into project management within the context of a large-scale academic research initiative. The program concludes with a dedicated symposium where participants present their research findings. Students are further encouraged to share their work through peer-reviewed publications and at national conferences. This unique environment offers undergraduates valuable exposure to the interdisciplinary nature of large-scale research facilities, preparing them for advanced degrees and careers in STEM.

Exploring Large-Scale Geometry via Local and Nonlocal Potential Theory,"This project will develop new mathematical tools for the analysis of metric measure spaces – that is, spaces equipped (like Euclidean space) with notions of distance and volume – with a focus on metric measure spaces that (unlike Euclidean space) lack smooth structure. The analysis of non-smooth spaces is a vital area of research with diverse applications across the mathematical and physical sciences, including fluid mechanics, neurophysiology, and fractal geometry. The PI will investigate the large-scale geometric behavior of objects in these spaces using the mathematical tools of local and nonlocal energies. Given a function measuring a physical phenomenon, such as temperature or momentum, local energies measure the function’s nearby or small-scale oscillations, while nonlocal energies measure its variations over long distances. A primary goal of this work is to develop much-needed mathematical tools for analyzing nonlocal energies. The project will also enhance the professional training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, through collaborative research projects, instruction in effective mathematical communication, and opportunities for research interactions with undergraduate students. The primary objects of study in this project are represented as metric measure spaces that lack smooth structure. The finite dimensionality of the ambient space is represented by the property of supporting a doubling Radon measure. In such a setting, nearby or asymptotic oscillation of a function is measured using upper gradients, which are viable substitutes for the derivative of a function, and the local energy is associated with the collection of functions on the object, called Sobolev functions. The large-scale variation energy is associated with the collection called Besov space of functions. Recent research has uncovered a connection between local energies on a region in a metric measure space and nonlocal energies on the boundary of the region. The project will leverage this connection to explore the large-scale geometry of nonlocal energies on the boundary of the region by linking them with small-scale behavior of local energies on the region itself. In particular, connections between Dirichlet-type boundary value problems and Neumann-type boundary value problems will be investigated.

Collaborative Research: Microscale Plasma Processes at High Beta in Shock and Turbulent Environments,"Ordinary gases like the Earth's atmosphere are often characterized by their pressure and temperature, from which it's possible to make many useful predictions using the laws of thermodynamics. Astrophysical gases follow similar laws, but most astrophysical systems are plasmas: made up of energetic, electrically charged particles often with an embedded magnetic field. Under these conditions the simple thermodynamic descriptions do not apply because the laws which regulate the flow of energy between charged particles and the electromagnetic fields are so complex. Examples of such systems include accretion disks around black holes, the tenuous medium pervading clusters of galaxies, and the solar wind coming off of our own Sun. This project will use state of the art computer hardware and software to extract simple descriptions of these systems and use them to develop testable predictions for fundamental, observables such as the rate at which galaxy cluster plasmas emit x-rays and radio waves, whether plasma orbiting a black hole is swallowed up or launched into high energy jets, and what mechanisms power Nature's most energetic explosions, such as the mysterious bursts of radio waves and gamma rays detected throughout the cosmos. Hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics are proven tools for elucidating the properties of diffuse astrophysical gas and have enabled great progress. Still, many unsolved problems remain, including heating and acceleration of particles at shocks and transport of momentum and heat in a turbulent plasma rich in instabilities driven by velocity space anisotropies. This collaborative award to Columbia University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison supports development of physics-based models of kinetic, non-equilibrium processes suitable for use in fluid codes. The project will focus on (1) particle heating and acceleration in shocks and (2) thermodynamics and transport driven by large scale turbulence. These problems will be investigated with numerical simulations, analytical theory, and spacecraft data. The project will engage undergraduate students who will receive mentorship and academic support throughout the project. The project will also develop an interactive website that will be used to expose local high-school students to the forefront of astrophysical research during day-long workshops in the schools.

RUI: Undergraduate Participation in the Search for Rare Events with CUORE and CUPID,"Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet scientists do not know two of their key properties: their mass and whether they are their own antiparticle. Because of their abundance, even a tiny neutrino mass could have far-reaching consequences. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles informs why our universe has so much matter and very little antimatter, which in turn address why the familiar material reality surrounding us exists at all. It may also help scientists understand the very source of neutrino mass, which is currently a great mystery. Neutrinoless double beta decay is an as-yet-detected nuclear decay that is remarkably sensitive to these unknown neutrino properties; attempting to characterize this decay informs scientists about these core questions. With this project, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo undergraduate students and their faculty mentor will have the exciting opportunity to be involved the international CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) and CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification) experiments in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay. They will Learn by Doing, travel abroad, and work hands-on with these cutting-edge projects by helping to improve the detectors and analyze data. Undergraduate research opportunities such as this allow students to contribute to important science and generate formative experiences for early technical careers. This ultimately contributes to a competent and competitive US technical workforce and seeds a generation of future scientists. CUORE is a well-established bolometry experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay and other rare events in 130-Te. CUORE has been taking data since 2017 at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. It is an array of TeO_2 crystals used as cryogenic bolometers for the purpose of particle detection. CUPID is a next-generation experiment undergoing R&D; it fits well into the suite of future developments of the field by increasing sensitivity to rare events such as neutrinoless double beta decay. In particular, CUPID uses both the bolometric and scintillating properties of Li_2MoO_4 crystals to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in 100-Mo. Cal Poly students will assist in efforts to transition from CUORE and CUPID operations. Moreover, they will participate in data analysis and remote shifts for CUORE.

Homological and enumerative intrinsic mirror symmetry and related topics,"Mirror symmetry is a deep and multi-faceted phenomenon observed by theoretical particle physicists in the context of string theory. It involves connections between different mathematical structures, such as computing volumes versus counting objects. Investigations of the phenomenon have produced a long list of fundamentally new techniques and uncovered unexpected links between hitherto largely unrelated branches of mathematics and physics. Research under this award aims to prove a part of mirror symmetry in the original setup of Calabi-Yau varieties, a distinguished class of spaces in both algebraic and differential geometry. In this setting, pairs of mirror partners have been constructed in rather complete generality, and the remaining task is to prove the two main claimed relations between the geometries: the mentioned enumerative prediction and homological mirror symmetry. This project will provide research training opportunities for students. Concerning homological mirror symmetry, the goal is to relate the intrinsic mirror ring for a degeneration of Calabi-Yau varieties constructed by the PI and Mark Gross to the symplectic monodromy ring for the degeneration, defined by Floer theory. Another related topic is the generalization of the intrinsic mirror ring to a relative quantum cohomology ring for a pair of a normal crossings divisor in a smooth projective variety. The task for enumerative mirror symmetry is to compute enumerative period integrals from the wall structure appearing in the mirror construction.

MRI: Equipment: Acquisition of a Helium Recovery System for the FSU Superconducting Linac,"This award supports the installation of a helium-recovery system at the John D. Fox Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory (Fox Lab) on the campus of Florida State University. The Fox Laboratory is one of the nation’s most important training grounds for nuclear scientists at both the Ph.D. and undergraduate levels. Liquefied helium is used to cool the accelerator structures to a temperature a few degrees above absolute zero, at which point they become superconducting. This superconducting accelerator is used to accelerate atomic nuclei, which are then used to perform experiments that explore the nuclear reactions that take place in stars and the ways in which the forces between protons and neutrons cause novel phenomena within nuclei. Twice a year, the accelerator is warmed for regular maintenance and approximately 45% of the helium inventory is lost. The helium recovery system supported by this grant will eliminate losses during scheduled or accidental warm-ups, like those that occur during power outages, mitigating a significant and rapidly growing cost in operating the Fox Lab. The helium-recovery system supported by this grant will allow for more efficient operation and more flexible scheduling at the accelerator, which serves scientists and graduate students at FSU as well as visitors from several universities and national laboratories. This project supports the installation of a helium-recovery system at the John D. Fox Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory (Fox Lab) on the campus of Florida State University. The Fox Lab accelerator system consists of a Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator boosted by a superconducting Linear Accelerator (Linac). The FSU group of six tenure-line faculty, their graduate students, as well as external groups from Louisiana State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed the experimental facilities at the laboratory. The laboratory operates three signature programs, the RESOLUT radioactive beam facility, the Super-Enge Split-Pole spectrograph and the Clarion-2 Compton-suppressed germanium detector array. The FSU laboratory is the only heavy-ion nuclear physics laboratory in the southeastern USA and is one of the nation’s most important training grounds for nuclear scientists at both the Ph.D. and undergraduate levels. The researchers working at the Fox Lab pursue two primary scientific goals. The first goal is to reproduce in the laboratory the nuclear reactions that take place in stellar explosions, which produce the majority of heavy elements in the universe. The second goal is to measure the behavior of exotic nuclei – that is, isotopes in which the ratio of neutrons to protons is either too large to be stable (and therefore naturally occurring) or too small to be stable and provide rigorous tests of our understanding of the behavior of all nuclei. The cryogenic operation of the superconducting linac is affected by the increasing costs for helium, which likely will soon become the laboratory’s largest cryogenic expense. The system acquired through this grant will enable an essentially helium-loss-free operation of the accelerator, by recovering and purifying helium that currently would be lost when the facility is warmed up, which typically occurs twice a year. In addition, the recovery system will be backed-up by an electrical generator, avoiding helium loss during unforeseeable power disruptions. We estimate that the proposed system will recycle the equivalent of 1850 liter of liquid helium per year, which otherwise would be lost.

REU Site: Summer Research in Physics and Astronomy at UC Santa Barbara,"This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of California-Santa Barbara. The site will support eight students per year for nine weeks of summer research in topics including Astronomy/Astrophysics, Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Biophysics/Physics of Living Systems, Condensed Matter Physics, Gravity, Elementary Particle Physics. The REU is intended to be a transformative experience in the career path of the participants, particularly those from institutions with fewer research opportunities, by providing the necessary mentorship to explore their interest in Physics and develop the professional skills needed to succeed in a career in academia or industry. The project will develop research and professional skills of the next generation of academic physicists and the STEM workforce by giving undergraduates the opportunity to participate in cutting edge research, with faculty who have extensive experience in fostering undergraduate research from Freshman to Senior level students. The REU students will engage in research to explore black hole entropy, search for new Physics at the LHC, study the dynamics of morphogenesis, study galaxy formation, discover exoplanets, investigate novel Josephson junctions, perform quantum simulation using ultracold quantum gases, contributing to the creation and advancement of knowledge in a broad variety of research areas, at the same time learning the skills that transfer to a variety of STEM careers.

Analysis and Dynamics in Several Complex Variables,"This award supports research at the interface of several complex variables, differential geometry, and dynamical systems. Complex analysis studies the behavior and regularity of functions defined on and taking values in spaces of complex numbers. It remains an indispensable tool across many domains in the sciences, engineering, and economics. This project considers the smoothness of transformations on a domain defined by complex valued functions when the domain is deformed. Using integral formulas, the PI will study how invariants of a domain vary when the underlying structure of the domain changes. Another component of the project involves the study of resonance. The PI will use small divisors that measure non-resonance to classify singularities of the complex structure arising in linear approximations of curved manifolds. The project will involve collaboration with researchers in an early career stage and will support the training of graduate students. Motivated by recent counterexamples showing that smooth families of domains may be equivalent by a discontinuous family of biholomorphisms, the PI will study the existence of families of biholomorphisms between families of domains using biholomorphism groups and other analytic tools such as Bergman metrics. The PI will construct a global homotopy formula with good estimates for suitable domains in a complex manifold. One of the goals is to construct a global formula in cases when a local homotopy formula fails to exist. The PI will use such global homotopy formulas to investigate the stability of holomorphic embeddings of domains with strongly pseudoconvex or concave boundary in a complex manifold, when the complex structure on the domains is deformed. The PI will use this approach to investigate stability of global Cauchy-Riemann structures on Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of higher codimension. The project seeks a holomorphic classification of neighborhoods of embeddings of a compact complex manifold in complex manifolds via the Levi-form and curvature of the normal bundle. In addition, the PI will study the classification of Cauchy-Riemann singularities for real manifolds using methods from several complex variables and small-divisor conditions in dynamical systems.

Problems in Non-Positive Curvature,"Geometry is concerned with quantitative features of a space, while topology studies qualitative aspects of a space. As an example, a teacup and a donut are topologically the same (they both have a single hole), but geometrically different. Non-positive curvature is a geometric property of spaces, which roughly corresponds to the space being expansive at every point and in every direction. Spaces with this property are pervasive, both in mathematics and in nature. As a result, there are numerous different viewpoints and approaches to their study. This proposal is focused on a variety of problems that are loosely centered around non-positively curved spaces. The approaches are highly interdisciplinary, drawing on tools and techniques from various distinct areas of mathematics. This project also provides opportunities for graduate student and postdoc research and training. The Principal Investigator (PI) will work on various projects in non-positive curvature that fall into four broad categories. (1) Projects on Coxeter groups: the PI will construct high-dimensional right-angled Coxeter groups that virtually algebraically fiber, will construct some new examples of negatively curved manifolds that fiber over the circle, and will construct new Davis manifolds that are CAT(0) but do not support Riemannian non-positive curvature smoothing. (2) Projects on simplicial volume: the PI will study which 4-dimensional Davis manifolds have positive simplicial volume, and will study how Anasov diffeomorphims constrain the simplicial volume. (3) Construtions of new aspherical manifolds: the PI will construct some new non-arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds, some new negatively curved Riemannian manifolds, and will study the commensurability problem for these manifolds. (4) Geodesic flows: the PI will study the decay of correlations for geodesic flows on locally CAT(-1) spaces, and will construct a version of the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures for these flows.

Uncovering the Thermal Implications of Contact Scaling and Structure in 2D Semiconductors,"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in their mono- and few-layer configuration represent a viable alternative to silicon as channel material of future field-effect transistors (FETs). To fulfil this promise, TMCDs must still overcome several hurdles. One of them concerns their contacts, which have been identified as their most significant bottleneck to performance and scaling. There has been a surge of interest in understanding and improving electron transport at metal - 2D semiconductor interfaces in order to increase the scalabilty, reliability, and efficiency of the resultant devices. So far, the accent has been set on the choice of the electrode material (from noble to transition metals and semi-metallic compounds) and on the contact geometry (top, side, or mixed), the objectives being to reduce the Schottky barrier height and to enhance the carrier injection into the channel. Hence, contact resistances below 100 O·µm have been demonstrated for MoS2-based FETs.While impressive, these results do not yet allow for TMDCs to compete with Si-based transistors. First, they are typically obtained with top contact architectures that are not compatible with next-generation multi-bridge-channel FETs where ultra-thin materials are needed. Secondly, the endurance and device-to-device variability of low-resistance contacts have not yet been shown. Thirdly, their thermal properties have not been investigated. While it has been reported that self-heating might play an important role in 2D transistors with local hot spots reaching up to 300 degrees, thermal dissipation at metal - 2D semiconductor interfaces has received little attention. However, if the thermal coupling of contacts is not properly engineered, it could lead to overheating and permanent device breakdowns.The thermal implications of distinct contact structures to TMDCs, including the impact of scaling, will therefore be examined in this project. As testbed, WS2, one of the most prominent members of the TMDC family, has been chosen because it can act both as n- and p-type transistor. The contact issue will be addressed from an experimental and theoretical point-of-view by combining the expertise of two researchers, Prof. Aaron D. Franklin at Duke University (USA) and Prof. Mathieu Luisier at ETH Zurich (Switzerland). PI Franklin will concentrate on the fabrication of WS2 transistors with advanced contact structures relying on different metals and geometries and on their electrical and thermal characterization. He has led the field with his groundbreaking work on edge contacts to 2D semiconductors. PI Luisier, who has pioneered nanoscale device modeling techniques, will provide theoretical insights into the contact physics through ab initio simulations based on electron and phonon quantum transport and will deliver design guidelines to the experimental partner at Duke University.Targeted as part of this project are scalable contact configurations to mono-, bi-, and trilayer WS2 with relatively low electrical resistances (R_c<300 O·µm), high thermal boundary conductance (G_th>10^8  W/(K·m^2)), and little device-to-device variability. Satisfying these requirements is essential to enable the deployment of the 2D technology into main stream integrated circuit applications.",331864,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,United States,Switzerland,Engineering; Materials Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
WoU-MMA: Multiscale Simulations of Neutron Star Mergers,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. Neutron star mergers are one of the most powerful events in the Universe. These events shake the very fabric of spacetime generating so-called gravitational waves that can be detected at distances of hundreds of millions of light years by observatories such as NSF's Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). In the extreme conditions found in these events, some of the material inside the neutron stars is transformed into rare elements. Indeed, it is thought that most rare-earth elements, which power all our modern technology, are produced in neutron star mergers. The gravitational wave and light signals from neutron star mergers contain a wealth of information about the physics of matter at extreme densities and the conditions in which these elements are formed. However, their interpretation is complicated by the fact that the motion of plasma in neutron star mergers is very chaotic. This project aims to develop new techniques, inspired by the methodology developed in weather forecasts, to predict the motion of matter in neutron star mergers and its resulting astronomical signals. This project is dedicated to studying the multimessenger emission and the nucleosynthesis yield from neutron star mergers. The team will perform the first ""zoom-in"" simulations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the hot, dense, nuclear matter formed in mergers. These simulations will be used to develop turbulence models and train machine learning algorithms bridging the scale separation between the neutrino-viscous scale (centimeters) and the disk size (hundreds of kilometers). Global simulations using these new models will be employed to develop uncertainty-quantified models of the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signal from merging neutron stars to interpret past and future observations.

Geometric Techniques for Studying Singular Solutions to Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations in Physics,"The Principal Investigator (PI) will study evolution equations that arise in several physical models of nature, including Einstein’s equations of general relativity, Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism, Euler’s equations of compressible fluid mechanics, and new, modified versions of Euler’s equations that account for viscous effects that were experimentally discovered in the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and neutron stars. While these equations have been studied for many decades, much remains to be understood about the dynamics of solutions. This project will focus on deriving theoretical results in one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas of study: singularity formation. Roughly, singularities are infinities that can develop in solutions, making the equations exceptionally challenging to study. Such infinities lie at the crux of some of the most fascinating physical phenomena. Outstanding examples include Big Bangs in general relativity, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite, and shock waves in compressible fluids, where pressure gradients become infinitely large. The results of the project will shed deep new insights into the laws of nature. The PI will integrate education, research, and scientific training by incorporating undergraduates, Master’s degree students, PhD students, and postdoctoral scholars into the research program. The PI aims to prove novel stable blowup-results in multidimensions for solutions to the Cauchy problem for the PDE systems mentioned above, which are quasilinear and hyperbolic in character. For compressible Euler flow, the goal is to prove shock-formation, with an eye towards understanding the global structure of the largest possible classical solution, i.e, the Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development (MGHD). There are currently no results on the global structure of the MGHD, and such results are essential for proving the uniqueness of classical solutions with shocks. For the viscous fluid models, there are currently no constructive blowup-results, so any constructive singularity-formation result would be the first of its kind. For Einstein’s equations (coupled to various matter models), the goal is to understand the structure and stability of spacetime singularities, with a focus on techniques that are localizable and robust, thus allowing one to probe new solution regimes. In all of the problems, gauge choices motivated by geometric and analytical considerations lie at the heart of the analysis.

"Quantum Groups, W-algebras, and Brauer-Kauffmann Categories","Symmetries are patterns that repeat or stay the same when certain changes are made, like rotating a shape or reflecting it in a mirror. They are everywhere in nature, from the spirals of a seashell to the orbits of planets around the sun. They also hide behind mathematical objects and the laws of physics. Quantum groups and Lie algebras are tools mathematicians use to study these symmetries. This project is a deep dive into understanding the underlying structure of these patterns, even when they're slightly changed or twisted, and how they influence the behavior of everything around us. The project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students. In more detail, the PI will develop emerging directions in i-quantum groups arising from quantum symmetric pairs as well as develop applications in various settings of classical types beyond type A. The topics include braid group actions for i-quantum groups; Drinfeld presentations for affine i-quantum groups and twisted Yangians, and applications to W-algebras; character formulas in parabolic categories of modules for finite W-algebras; and categorification of i-quantum groups, and applications to Hecke, Brauer and Schur categories.

Research in Field Theory and String Theory,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sumit R. Das at the University of Kentucky. The construction of a consistent framework combining the laws of Quantum Mechanics, which describes microscopic phenomena, and General Relativity, which describes gravitational phenomena, remains one of the most important unsolved problems in physics. In recent years it has become clear that a unique property of Quantum Mechanics called ""entanglement"" plays a key role in achieving this synthesis. This project aims to understand the connection of entanglement and gravitational phenomena in a precise fashion. Quantum entanglement is at the heart of a variety of physical phenomena observed in nature and is one of the basic principles used in the construction of quantum computers. Consequently, the results of this research will serve the national interest by advancing fundamental science in the US. The PI will also involve graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in this research, thus providing them the valuable training necessary to develop into independent scientists and educators. In addition, the results of this research will be used to enhance classroom education both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The PI also plans to give public talks about his work in various forums and lectures, and at the “Osher Lifelong Learning Institute” which offers courses and enrichment programs to members of the community. In addition, the PI plans to engage in “Science for Everyone, KY” which is an outreach program based in Lexington with an aim to increase scientific awareness in the community. More technically, Professor Das will study an approach to combining the laws of Quantum Mechanics and the laws of gravity which is based on the “holographic correspondence”. In this correspondence, gravitational phenomena in a certain number of spatial dimensions are related in a precise fashion to non-gravitational phenomena in a smaller number of dimensions. Previous research by the PI has uncovered the role of a new kind of quantum entanglement which involves the “internal” degrees of freedom of field theories in the holographic correspondence. The first goal of this project is to explore properties of this kind of entanglement and relate to notions of entanglement in the gravitational description. The second goal is to study how entanglement and other quantum information theoretic features like complexity behave in cosmology, particularly near the big bang, with the hope that this would teach us how to think of this epoch of the universe in a controlled fashion. The third goal concerns the application of these concepts to situations in many-body physics which are driven out of equilibrium by an external disturbance. This latter class of phenomena are intimately related to the quantum physics of black holes which displays chaotic behavior. This should provide insight into various puzzles posed by the Hawking radiation of black holes.

Symmetry and topology for quantum matter in and out of equilibrium,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports research and education activities with a goal to develop a fundamental understanding of quantum phases of matter with many interacting particles, using the concepts of symmetry and topology. Symmetry is a fundamental aspect of a physical system and has been recognized as a powerful principle in modern theoretical physics. A familiar example is the fact that total electric charge is conserved in everyday physical processes, which can help distinguish between electric conductors, insulators and superconductors. In the realm of quantum mechanics, a system of interacting particles, such as electrons, can form unusual quantum states, in which the constituent particles move collectively in highly intricate patterns, making them resilient to small changes in external conditions. Deciphering these subtle patterns requires ideas from topology, a branch of mathematics that concerns properties of geometric shapes that are unchanged by smooth deformations. A deeper understanding of these quantum states may enable new schemes in harnessing quantum materials and designing quantum devices. This project will leverage the power of the symmetry principle to advance the knowledge of exotic quantum states. The first thrust will investigate the properties of ""symmetry defects"", which are specific disturbances introduced to the system to reveal its underlying symmetry. Studying how the system reacts to such changes provides new methods to observe and characterize the unique quantum properties of the states involved. In the second thrust, the focus will be on the relationship between physical properties of a quantum crystal and microscopic interactions at the atomic level. This will furnish new perspectives on how crystalline quantum materials can be modeled theoretically. In the last thrust, the project will explore how the quantum behaviors of many interacting particles are affected by their interactions with the environment. Progress on this front will be crucial in exploiting these quantum states as memory for quantum information processing. This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities through mentoring and training of graduate students and postdocs in theoretical condensed matter research; writing pedagogical review articles and organizing conferences and workshops; outreach to K-12 students and the general public. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports research and education activities with a goal to advance knowledge about quantum phases of matter with global symmetry and many-body topology as guiding principles. Characterizing the emergence of quantum phases from complex interactions between microscopic degrees of freedom represents a key challenge in quantum science. Advances in both condensed matter physics and quantum information science have significantly broaden the scope of quantum phases and provided new settings where universal behaviors of quantum many-body systems can arise. The project has three main thrusts: 1) Systematically develop a theory for a new type of non-local observables, called the disorder operators. These operators probe the fluctuations of symmetry charges in a given spatial region of the system, whose scaling behavior contains universal information about the underlying quantum state. The team will study how subleading corrections to the disorder operator depend on microscopic details, and develop field-theoretic techniques to compute them at quantum critical points. 2) Examine new aspects of UV/IR mixing: The interplay between microscopic conditions in lattice systems and macroscopic observables will be examined using the newly developed perspective of topological defects. The project will study how anomaly of a low-energy theory manifests in lattice quantum numbers and, conversely, how anomalous fractonic symmetries constrain low-energy dynamics. 3) Symmetry breaking and topological order in open quantum systems: the research team will investigate a new kind of symmetry breaking in mixed-state quantum phases and its implications on equilibration dynamics, and explore many-body topological order in quantum states under decoherence and beyond. This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities through mentoring and training of graduate students and postdocs in theoretical condensed matter research; writing pedagogical review articles and organizing conferences and workshops; outreach to K-12 students and the general public.

However, scaling-up towards full-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers will involve addressing many challenges concerning, e. g. , qubit coherence, reproducibility, stability, cross-talk, control, and readout. In order to achieve this, a new generation of metrological methods and tools will be needed. This project will develop such a suite of tools for superconducting qubits and apply them to state-of-the-art one- and two-qubit circuits. These new tools will underpin further engineering advances and allow for accurate characterisation of qubits and materials, as well as manipulation and read-out.",329936,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
RUI: Negative Ion Spectroscopy and Dynamics,"The primary goal of this project is to improve the understanding of how electrons interact with each other on the atomic scale, which is crucial for the stability of atoms and for the formation of molecules through chemical reactions. To gain insights into electron interactions, the faculty and undergraduate student researchers will experimentally investigate the properties of negative ions (atoms with an extra electron). Negative ions are important in a wide variety of physical situations ranging from electrical sparks to the atmospheres of planets and stars. In experiments at Denison University (an undergraduate institution) and at a national lab facility in Sweden, laser light will be used to excite or detach electrons from negative ions; the laser supplies a finely controlled amount of input energy to probe interactions within the ions. The results will build the fundamental atomic physics database, provide valuable tests of state-of-the-art theoretical atomic structure calculations, and yield key insights into dynamical many-body interactions, which is a topic of interest for a broad range of fields in physics, chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology. Students will participate in all aspects of the research, providing significant technical training for young scientists in cutting-edge electronics, lasers, and computers, and enhancing their ability for future careers in science, technology, and engineering. The interactions of photons with negative ions will be investigated in two series of photoexcitation and photodetachment experiments. The extra electron in a negative ion is bound predominantly by electron correlation effects and therefore negative ions provide a fertile testing ground for detailed atomic physics calculations regarding these multi-body interactions. Planned studies of the negative ion of thorium are particularly important because it is a promising candidate for laser cooling, which has not yet been achieved with negative ions but could potentially open up the ultracold regime for a wide range of negatively-charged species through sympathetic collisional cooling. On-campus at Denison University, the faculty and student researchers will use an ion beam–tunable infrared laser system to measure multiple bound states of the thorium anion with resonant two-photon detachment spectroscopy. They will also use photodetachment threshold spectroscopy to measure the isotope shift in the electron affinity of thallium, which is sensitive to interactions of electrons both with each other and with the nucleus. Complementary experiments of excited state lifetimes, decay processes, and isotope shifts in negative ions will be performed at Stockholm University in Sweden using the cryogenic electrostatic ion storage ring DESIREE. The dynamic multi-electron interactions in highly-correlated negative ions continue to challenge the fundamental understanding of atomic structure, and this project will extend the available experimental data to more complex negative ion systems, spur new theoretical studies, and directly address pressing open questions in the field. Support from this grant will enhance the research and teaching infrastructure of Denison University and provide undergraduate students valuable research experiences and technical training which will prepare them for advanced study and STEM careers.

Time-resolved sImulations of ultrafast phenoMena in quantum matErialS (TIMES),"Emergent phenomena arising from excitation, correlation, and coherence of electrons, spin, photons and nuclei may open unexplored paths to exploit advanced quantum materials. Modelling and understanding ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics is the key to quantum computing, to new paradigms for information storage and retrieval, to novel optoelectronic devices for efficient light emission and renewable energy production, and to efficient single-photon quantum emitters.
The TIMES doctoral network will merge different areas of expertise in many-body and time-dependent electronic structure methods to define a new paradigm for the atomistic modelling of nonequilibrium processes in condensed matter. This is an area where the theoretical state-of-the-art is lacking in predictive power. On one hand, modelling crucial dynamical processes such as the ones involving energy exchange between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom out-of-equilibrium remains out of reach for current first-principles approaches. On the other hand, phenomenological and second-principles models lack the granularity required to quantitatively capture the evolution of complex materials. 

TIMES will develop first-principles theoretical and computational tools to tackle the coherent and correlated electron-nuclei dynamics stimulated by ultrafast laser pulses for the understanding of complex quantum states and emergent phenomena in a diverse range of functional materials like perovskites, 2D materials, Weyl semimetals, Dirac materials and topological insulators. For this purpose, TIMES will train a new generation of scientists capable of devising novel theoretical and computational frameworks to simulate nonequilibrium phenomena. TIMES will synergize theoretical and numerical developments with High Performance Computer Centres, SMEs, and big-data facilities across Europe.

The impact of cosmic rays on the interstellar medium,"Cosmic rays (CRs) are a fundamental ingredient in the structure and evolution of galaxies. Mostly produced within galactic disks through shock acceleration in supernova, these high-energy non-thermal particles easily spread throughout the interstellar medium (ISM). Evidence suggests that CRs may significantly contribute to the dynamics of the ISM, and understanding how CRs impact ISM dynamics on galactic scales is central to galaxy evolution studies. This research team will carry out a comprehensive theoretical investigation of how the distribution of CRs, in space and energy, vary with the dynamical, thermal, and magnetic properties of the gas. The investigators will train and mentor a graduate student and an undergraduate student for PhD dissertation and senior thesis research, respectively. The team will make the visual materials from the simulations public and easily accessible through the creation of a website, distribute results on social media, and participate in outreach events aimed at high school students. The project will systematically and quantitatively assess the role of CRs in regulating the state of the ISM and influencing galactic evolution in a variety of environments. The simulations will take advantage of a previously developed state-of-the art codebase (including magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, adaptive ray tracing, photochemistry, star cluster population synthesis for supernova and radiation feedback) and employ a new algorithm in which the propagation of CRs intimately depends on the properties of the multiphase ISM and CRs themselves. This project will self-consistently treat star formation and the resulting UV heating and injection of mass, SN energy, and CRs because of stellar feedback, and will consider several environments as would be found in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The team will perform a suite of 3D shearing-box simulations of kpc-sized portions of galactic disks representative of galactic environments typical of Milky Way-like galaxies, with varying star formation rate, gas surface density, and gravitational potential.

Collaborative Research: A New Kind of Exoplanet Direct Imaging Search: Extreme AO Imaging of Accelerating Stars,"Ground based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO) have now provided direct imaging (DI) detections of about 20 extrasolar gas giant planets. Targets are usually selected based on system properties like age and distance, and these surveys have low yields, about 1%. These detections do not directly measure a planet’s mass and often poorly measure its orbit. This program takes a different approach to exoplanet imaging discovery and characterization, to remedy these aspects. DI survey targets are selected from among young, nearby stars based on their accelerations across the sky, indicating they are being gravitationally pulled by a dimmer companion. The search is expected to discover new exoplanets via two world-class ground-based AO systems located in Hawaii and – due to the selection criterion – measure their masses and constrain their orbits. This project will start a collaborative partnership with Maunakea Visitor’s Center, providing funding for new exhibits that highlight the knowledge about extrasolar planets revealed from Maunakea and the cultural and biological significance of Maunakea. It will support an astronomy-related internship to a student in Hawaii in the Akamai Workforce Initiative. Local to one PI’s institution, the project supports and expands the San Antonio Teachers Training Astronomy Academy, providing effective science education professional development for Texas high school teachers who predominately teach economically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority groups. The dynamical evidence for a companion from precision astrometry is contained in the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations (HGCA): i.e., stars showing an astrometric acceleration. The project uses the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics Project (SCExAO) coupled with the CHARIS integral field spectrograph in the near-infrared (near-IR) to discover the perturbing bodies. For the brightest planets and brown dwarfs, analogues to jovian planets, it will also obtain follow-up thermal IR imaging with NIRC2 camera on the Keck II Telescope. The new dynamical code orvara simultaneously constrains the planet’s masses and orbits from these data. The planetary atmospheres are analyzed via empirical libraries and new atmospheric models. These discoveries anchor models of substellar formation and evolution from the largest brown dwarfs to jovian exoplanets.

Collaborative Research: Protocomets to protoplanets: Connecting the chemical ecosystems of planet-forming disks across the spectrum,"This research team will study planet formation by characterizing the carbon monoxide (CO) gas in disks that surround new-born stars. This volatile gas may stick on grains and pebble-sized solids far away from the star within the disk, moving with them as they drift towards the star, where they may be released due to its heat. Using infrared spectroscopy to sense CO in the inner disk and millimeter images to sense CO in the outer disk, the team will probe, respectively, the planet-formation region and where most of the disk material exists as in a ‘reservoir’. Three graduate students will be trained in telescope observing and data modeling at the PhD level, and two undergraduate students will be involved in high level research. Calibrated datasets and open-source codes will be made publicly available. A new course on radio astronomy for undergraduate astronomy majors will be developed. There will be broader outreach to local middle and high schools through summer programs and campus visits, and to the community at large through public events. Recent observations and simulations suggest that CO chemistry is being impacted by dynamical and chemical processing. Patterns between the derived CO column densities in the terrestrial planet forming zone (e.g., < 5 au) and in the outer bulk gas reservoir probed at ALMA-wavelengths will be sought. The program will use data from world-class ground-based observatories: the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile; and the Keck observatory and the Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. The collaboration leverages the strengths of the three participating institutions to provide the most complete picture to date of the volatile content of protoplanetary disks.

Collaborative Research: Jump Starting LSST Proper Motion Science with 12 Years of DECam Observations,"Precise measurements of the motions of stars on the celestial sphere are critical for understanding the formation and content of the Milky Way galaxy. Astronomers create computer models of the motions of stars to help understand assembly history of the Milky Way, the nature of dark matter, and look for planets around nearby stars. However, the motions of stars are extremely and difficult to measure. Moderately bright stars have been measured with exquisite precision by the European Space Agency’s Gaia spacecraft, but larger telescopes are required to measure fainter stars. The investigators will develop and apply new techniques to measure the motions of faint stars using some of the world’s most powerful ground-based survey telescopes. As part of this project, the investigators will provide scientific and technical training for graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, the investigators will engage and educate the general public with visualizations of the dynamic motion of stars in the Milky Way. The investigators will measure the astrometric positions of stars in hundreds of thousands of images collected by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on NSF’s 4-m Blanco Telescope. The investigators will use the DECam data to perform best-ever measurements of the proper motions of hundreds of millions of stars that are too faint to have been measured previously. The DECam data cover nearly the entire sky area of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s unprecedented Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The investigators will combine the DECam and LSST data to measure the positions and motions of stars much more precisely than would be possible with the first year of LSST alone. This research award is partially funded by a generous gift from Charles Simonyi to the NSF Astronomy division. The project includes significant contributions to Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",322751,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
BSM-PM: Theory and Simulation for Beyond Standard Model Tests in Antihydrogen Experiments,"The PI, graduate, and undergraduate students will provide theoretical support for the experimental search for asymmetry between matter and antimatter by the ALPHA collaboration. The current understanding of the laws of physics predict perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter which is in tension with the observation that the universe is almost universally composed of matter. Any difference between hydrogen and its antimatter counterpart, antihydrogen, would challenge our understanding of the universe. The PI, graduate, and undergraduate students will perform calculations of basic processes in the ALPHA experiment to improve the precision of measurements of antihydrogen leading to more stringent tests matter/antimatter symmetry. In addition to the insights about fundamental physics, this project is an ideal training ground for theoretically minded graduate and undergraduate students. All students develop their own programs to explain different aspects of the ALPHA experiment and present their results to other scientists and the general public. They perform all tasks of physics research, growing as scientists in the process. This research project will provide theoretical and computational support in the experimental search for differences between the hydrogen atom and its antimatter counterpart, antihydrogen, by the ALPHA collaboration. Basic theoretical principles predict that the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen are identical except for some trivial sign changes. Several properties of the hydrogen atom have been measured to extraordinary levels of precision. The goal is to reach this same level of precision in antihydrogen measurements, enabling high precision tests of matter/antimatter symmetry. While this is fundamentally an experimental undertaking, theoretical and computational treatments of the ALPHA experiment increase the precision and accuracy of measured properties of antihydrogen. In addition, the simulations help improve the experiment. The PI, graduate, and undergraduate students will focus on simulating basic processes in the experiment including laser cooling, non-linear stochastic heating of antihydrogen, predictions of spectra in strong fields, and sympathetic cooling of plasmas. During this project’s time frame, we will greatly improve the antihydrogen measurements by increasing the number of trapped antihydrogen by more than 10X through improving the plasma conditions in the experiment. These improvements will lead to: at least 10X improvement in the spectral precision of the 1S2S transition, the ability to measure other transitions (e.g. 2S-2P or 2S-4P) for an independent determination of the antiproton radius and antihydrogen Rydberg constant, improved measurement of gravity on antihydrogen using ideas from non-linear dynamics, and precision measurement of the 1S hyperfine splitting. Antihydrogen synthesis, trapping, and measurements lie on the boundaries between atomic, plasma, and experimental particle physics and it cannot be studied properly without using tools from all these fields.

Comprehensive study of Low Surface Brightness Galaxy Formation and Evolution,"Galaxies are observed to come in many sizes and luminosities. Of particular interest are galaxies that, for their mass, are large and dim, called Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies. These galaxies are everywhere, making up nearly 50% of the. This proposal will help astronomers understand why LSBs look the way they do, including understanding the matter we can’t see: dark matter. This investigator will use large-scale computer simulations, which are able to model the universe from the big bang to present day. This award will also support GMU’s Women Leaders in Stem (WLIS) by funding expert education and STEM speakers to be hosted on campus for events. This will support the WLIS’s efforts to support undergraduate students through their STEM journeys, by providing professional development, networking strategies, study skills and future job resources. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is a fundamental goal in astronomy. One particular class of galaxies, Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies, is especially challenging to understand as LSB galaxies seem to have followed a different evolutionary path from their high surface brightness (HSB) counterparts. This investigator and her collaborators will carry out a comprehensive study LSB galaxies in order to identify their formation channel(s), explain their evolution, and understand their dark matter (DM) content and distribution in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM). In particular, they will (1) statistically study the formation of LSB galaxies as a function of mass and environment using the existing large-volume simulation Romulus25, (2) study classical LSB galaxies in detail by creating zoom-in simulations capable of resolving the interplay between baryonic physics dark matter distribution and, (3) use the Genetic Modification Technique (GM) technique on the zoom-in simulations in order to understand the role of angular momentum in their formation.

Diving into the mineralogy and structure of exotic rocky exoplanets,"Determining the diversity of exoplanets' compositions and structure is fundamental for investigating the Earth's uniqueness. The improvement of ground-based instruments and the launch of new space missions (e.g. JWST) is providing unprecedented information as to exoplanets' masses, radii and atmospheric speciation. However, none of these properties can uniquely constrain the nature of planetary interiors, which dictate their geological evolution. In order to interpret these new observations and identify future exoplanet targets, the implementation of accurate interior models is required. At present, much of our knowledge on exoplanets' interior comes from analogue experiments on Earth-like compositions performed over pressure-temperature-composition spaces relevant for the Solar System. Stellar data, however, has indicated a greater compositional diversity than in our own Solar System, thereby preventing an accurate description of the mineralogy and structure of orbiting planets. ExoDivers aims to bridge the gap between astronomical observations and the interior properties of exoplanets, by investigating the evolution of stable mineralogical assemblages for exotic compositions expected in exoplanetary cores and mantles with pressure and temperature. The experimental bulk compositions will derive from spectroscopic data of observed host stars, providing access to a compositional space that remains yet unstudied. Experiments will be performed to determine the stability of different minerals and refine their thermodynamic properties. These new data will supplement existing databases and will be used to calculate the mantle and core mineralogy of exoplanets. This novel approach obviates the Earth-centric view of exoplanets mineralogy that has characterized the field up to this point and will be implemented to determine, a priori, how variations in the interior affect geological processes, including the possibility of starting convection or activating a dynamo.",321665,2025,2028,European Commission,Italy; Switzerland,EU,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Deep-Inelastic-scattering and Vector-boson-fusion Advances,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) probes interactions among particles with unprecedented precision. The determination of the Higgs boson properties is a central pillar of the LHC physics program and of the current LHC run.

This demands for accurate theoretical predictions, which usually hinge on Monte Carlo event generators.  State-of-the-art predictions are given by next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations in QCD matched to leading-logarithmic (LL) parton shower (PS).  Next-to-NLO (NNLO) matching, necessary to advance the accuracy of theoretical predictions, is limited to specific processes, like the hadro-production of heavy systems in the final state.

Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) is the preferred channel for the determination of the Higgs to muon couplings and for Higgs to invisible searches. This project's aim is to pioneer NNLO matching techniques for processes characterised by the t-channel exchange of a colourless boson, such as VBF and Vector Boson Scattering (VBS), and to develop the first NNLO+PS generator for Higgs boson production in VBF.

Given the close relationship between higher-order corrections in VBF, VBS, and Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), the initial focus will be the formulation of a NNLO+PS matching scheme for DIS. This matching will preserve the logarithmic accuracy of both the new next-to LL (NLL) showers, and the standard LL ones. Additionally, to achieve this task, novel resummed predictions for DIS will be produced. Reaching NNLO+NLL accuracy within a comprehensive PS simulation is a groundbreaking endeavour.

These outcomes will be vital for precise studies of the Higgs sector in the current and future LHC runs, and for high-precision investigations at future DIS-type facilities like the Electron-Ion Collider. Furthermore, this project will lay the foundations for a more widely applicable NNLO+PS matching approach with superior logarithmic accuracy, which can be extended to a broader range of collider processes involving QCD jets.",321665,2025,2028,European Commission,Italy; Switzerland,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Photon- and Electron-Driven Atomic Collision Processes: General Theory and Accurate Numerical Calculations,"This project deals with the interaction of charged particles (mostly electrons) and light (mostly lasers and synchrotron radiation) with atoms and ions. The results are not only important for the understanding of the fundamental collision dynamics, but they also fulfill the urgent practical need for accurate atomic data to model the physics of stars, plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. The short-pulse intense-laser part of the project requires accurate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a numerical space-time grid. With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies can now be undertaken for realistic systems, as opposed to idealized models. This work is important to facilitate further developments in the imaging and control of submicroscopic reactions, which in turn are expected to have broad impact by reaching out from physics to chemistry and ultimately biology. Many experimental efforts worldwide are supported through the present project, which will also train a post-doctoral associate and several research students. Most of the numerical calculations will be based upon the non-perturbative close-coupling method, with the goal of pushing the expansion to convergence by including a sufficient number of low-lying physical bound states as well as pseudo-states to account for the coupling to the remainder of the infinite Rydberg spectrum as well as the ionization continuum. The group has contributed to the development, and hence has access to, some of the most sophisticated all-electron codes currently available to provide accurate quantitative predictions. These include the highly flexible B-spline R-matrix (BSR) implementation with non-orthogonal orbital sets to solve the close-coupling equations (developed in the PI's group at Drake University) and the R-matrix with Time Dependence (RMT) suite of codes developed in Belfast. While BSR was originally designed for time-independent processes (atomic structure, electron collisions with atoms and ions, weak-field photoionization), the group will adapt the output (multi-electron Coulomb and dipole matrix elements) from BSR to serve as input for RMT. This interface is expected to result in an accurate and efficient time-propagation scheme for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the interaction of intense short-pulse lasers with complex atomic targets. To assist in the understanding of the complex processes involved, simpler models such as the popular single-active electron approximation (SAE) will also be used for comparison between the predictions and the experimental data obtained in several collaborating laboratories. Continued student involvement in testing the numerical methods and associated computer codes, as well as visualizing the results, is expected.

Molecular Quantum Magnets on graphene as novel spin qubit platforms,"MolQuMag aims to pioneer new qubit platforms based on metal-organic molecules on graphene through the capability to detect, coherently manipulate, and readout their electronic spin states. In particular, intrinsic spin properties of metalated phthalocyanines and porphyrines will be tackled by means of the novel technique of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR-STM). This tool will provide the intrinsic figures of merit (decoherence and relaxation times, and Rabi rates) that unveil the feasibility of these metal-organic molecules as spin qubits. MolQuMag is of high relevance for the development of the next generation of quantum technologies based on the implementation of a large number of identical qubits as well as the development of efficient methods to interrogate them. The applicant will have the opportunity to immerse and gain valuable knowledge and expertise in the novel technique during the outgoing phase in the renowned ETHZ research laboratories in Switzerland, and bring her expertise on EPR-STM and quantum magnetism to Europe and in particular Spain, contributing to the expansion of quantum technologies in the Spanish research community, where the applicant plans to establish herself in the future.",317634,2024,2027,European Commission,Spain; Switzerland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Research in High Energy Physics and Cosmology,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Matthew B. Kleban at New York University. Modern cosmology presents us with several profound mysteries. First is the nature of ""dark energy,” invoked to account for the observational evidence showing that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Second is dark matter, an equally mysterious substance or particle needed to account for the rotations rates of galaxies, along with many other lines of evidence. Last is the question of the universe’s origin and why it has so many seemingly fine-tuned features. A breakthrough in understanding any of these fundamental questions would promote the progress of science and advance the national interest by potentially revealing new laws of nature and helping answer profound questions about our universe. This award will fund Prof. Matthew Kleban’s research into theories of hypothetical particles called axions that could help us understand some of these features of the universe. Additionally, it will support his investigations of the physics of primordial black holes, tiny singularities cloaked by event horizons the size of a hydrogen atom, which could constitute dark matter. Lastly, it will enable him to continue his work on the quantum physics of accelerating universes, such as the one we appear to inhabit. His work will have a broad impact through public lectures and interviews, and in inspiring and training undergraduate and graduate physics students at NYU, as well as young post-doctoral researchers and early-career scientists. More technically, Prof. Kleban will study the multi-axion landscapes predicted by compactifications of type IIB string theory and their applications to cosmology. He will investigate potential origins for primordial black holes in the early universe, building on his recent work on that topic. He will refine a technique he pioneered recently to compute non-perturbative transition rates from time-dependent initial states. Finally, he will return to the topic of quantum de Sitter spacetime, investigating the extent to which recently developed tools can be applied to uncover a holographic dual theory.

Patterns in the Cohomology of Linear Groups,"Groups are the mathematician's way of talking about symmetries. The general linear groups encapsulate the symmetries of linear spaces. Group cohomology encodes important information about these symmetries and the linear spaces themselves using a conceptual version of ""counting holes"". There are deep mathematical connections to many areas of mathematics and physics, including number theory, geometry, K-theory, and quantum field theory. The research will reveal patterns emerging in the cohomology of linear groups. The grant will also support conferences organized by the PI that bring together researchers of various backgrounds as well as outreach programs in Oklahoma exposing students to engaging mathematics. The group cohomology of linear groups has multiple parameters: The cohomological dimension, the size of the matrices, the precise group and ring. Different patterns emerge when varying one or multiple of theses parameters. For example, cohomological stability for the general linear groups means that for fixed cohomological dimension, the cohomology groups stay the same for large sizes of matrices. Principal congruence subgroups defined by a congruence condition on the matrices satisfy a more complicated pattern called representation stability. For fixed cohomological codimension, Church-Farb-Putman conjecture that the cohomology groups of the special linear groups of the integers vanish for large matrix sizes. For congruence subgroups in fixed cohomological codimension, one can ask about stability patterns akin to representation stability. The PI proposes to study a variety of those patterns with specific applications in mind: The Conrey–Farmer–Keating–Rubinstein–Snaith Conjecture on the asymptotics of moments of quadratic L-functions for function fields follows from uniform twisted homological stability for braid groups, which in turn are closely related to homological stability for certain congruence subgroups of odd-dimensional symplectic groups. Part of the Kummer-Vandiver Conjecture is to proof that twelfth K-group of the integers is zero. This would follow from Church-Farb-Putman Conjecture for all codimensions up to 4.

Collaborative Research: Exploring the role of nature vs. nurture in the formation of multiple star systems,"Our solar system contains only one star, but most systems contain two or more stars. The number of stars in a system depends on the conditions when those stars were born. The team will study the formation of multi-star systems using computer models. These models including physics like gravity, turbulence, radiation and feedback from the stars themselves, such as winds and heating. The investigators will analyze the models to study the different ways multi-star systems form. Studying the origin of stars enables a better understanding of the origin of our own solar system and how common Earth-like planets. They will create summary movies, targeted for the public, by creating visually appealing moves for planetarium shows. The team will help train the next generation of scientists and the technical workforce. They will build an inclusive environment for students and provide practical hands-on computer training that will allow the students to work in industry or academia. Binary star formation occurs during the earliest stages of star formation, when star-forming cores and disks are highly obscured and difficult to probe at high resolution. The proposal addresses a fundamental question: Why do some filaments, cores, and disks produce multiple gravitationally bound stars, while others produce only single stars? To address this question, the proposers will study the physics responsible for stellar multiplicity, with a specific focus on determining the incidence of each channel for multiple formation and on disentangling the impact of the initial gas conditions (nature) from the influence of dynamical interactions (nurture). The team will analyze a series of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation that include all major physical processes in order to explore the relationship between multiple protostellar systems, gas properties and dynamical interactions.

REcommissioning and DEorbiting using Cubesat swarms with electrO spRAy ThrusTErs,"Space industry is growing at an unprecedented rate with more satellites launched into low Earth orbits (LEO) each year than ever before.  This is leading to an increasing number of collisions of uncontrolled space objects and space debris accumulation in LEO.  Sustainability of the space economy requires new techniques to address space debris. REDECORATE proposes CubeSat swarms as a cost-effective way to mitigate space debris. It develops a debris deorbiting and recommission concept combining novel control and guidance approaches and a CubeSat swarm equipped with staged ionic electro spray engines (iESE). A CubeSat swarm can rendezvous with space debris, dissipate its rotational energy (detumble) using reaction wheels. The main thrusters lower the debris orbit to burn-up the system in the atmosphere. Such a mission is highly challenging, requires coordinated CubeSat swarm guidance and control, reliable hardware and effective propulsion - a combination which does not exist so far. First, staged iESE thrusters facilitate longer missions and achieve higher reliability and thrust than standard CubeSat propulsion. If the CubeSats are attached around a decommissioned satellite, coordinated activation of the iESEs can function as a new control system for detumbling (avoiding unreliable reaction wheels), deorbiting and due to their long life-time even recommissioning. Second, a safe-by-design hierarchical control framework will be developed to address the need for high reliability. It uses a planner-tracker feedback stack and addresses all mission segments. Third, integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) will be used to increase robustness w.r.t. system uncertainties and communication delay inside the swarm. The feasibility of the concept will be validated using IQC-based and probabilistic robustness analyses on a digital twin of the iESE CubeSat swarm and microcontrollers-in-the-loop. In summary, the project will provide Europe with know-how to tackle the space debris crisis.",313269,2024,2027,European Commission,Germany; United States; United States,EU,Engineering; Aerospace Engineering; Space Sciences
A Blueprint for Photonic Quantum Computer,"Recent technological advances allow to build revolutionary devices for information processing by making use of the laws of quantum mechanics. Most strikingly, quantum communication allows to transmit information with physical security guarantees at rates exceeding the capacities of classical links and quantum computers provide a means to speed up certain computations solving certain problems faster than any (present or future) classical computer. One such problem is factoring large numbers into their primes. This problem is the basis of much of modern cryptography such as the security of any information transfer through the internet. But the factoring problem was shown to be efficiently computable on a quantum computer using Shor’s algorithm. A functional quantum computer would therefore jeopardize the security of the internet. Quantum computation with a discrete-variable system such as a two-level electron spin demands temperatures colder than those found in deep space. However, continuous-variable systems, such as photons (particles of light) can operate at room temperatures and are more robust against decoherence, allowing for full miniaturization and mass manufacturing. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes provides a new set of techniques to run a quantum algorithm with an arbitrary level of accuracy despite using imperfect noisy photons. Photonic quantum codes exhibit either translational or rotational symmetry in phase space. Potential of the latter has remained largely unexplored despite convincing evidence for a striking advantage. In PhoQC, I will develop a novel stabilizer formalism to systematically study rotational symmetry in phase space. I will find quantum codes operating on the entire or a part of the Hilbert space and I develop the corresponding universal logics. We are at the dawn of the quantum computing age and the quantum codes and techniques developed in PhoQC will bring (photonic) quantum computation closer to industrial deployment.",313267,2024,2027,European Commission,Germany; United States,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Collaborative Research: An Empirical Blueprint for the Gravitational-Wave Background,Orbiting supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are thought to produce very low frequency gravitational waves that could be detected by careful timing of the arrival of radio pulses from pulsars through the ongoing pulsar timing array project. It is expected that the combined signals from many of these systems will produce a background noise that may soon be detectable by pulsar timing arrays. This project will use a new method based on observations of accreting supermassive black holes to provide an estimate of the strength of this background noise as well as it's distribution in gravitational wave frequencies. The project will use this new method to provide a framework for determining the history of the growth of supermassive black holes once the background noise is detected. The project will also create a Pulsar Search Collaboratory hub in New Jersey and New York that will involve high school students in the search for pulsars using real data. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea. The project will use observations of quasar luminosity functions at different redshifts combined with local observations of dual Active Galactic Nuclei to build an empirically-based model of the cosmological distribution of supermassive black hole binaries that will contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background expected to be detected in pulsar timing array observation. This approach is complementary to the existing approach that is based on galaxy merger simulations. The new approach will determine key physical parameters that can be constrained through detection of the gravitational wave background. The project will also create a Pulsar Search Collaboratory hub in New Jersey and New York. The Pulsar Search Collaboratory is a long-standing NSF supported program that allows high schools students to search for pulsars with real radio data. It is a low-barrier way for students to experience science and scientific discovery.

Post Born-Oppenheimer Approximation for Semiclassical Spectroscopy Investigation of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Processes,"The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA) has determined how chemists describe molecules since 1927. BOA separates electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, considering that the electron timescale is much shorter than the nuclear one. This assumption does not hold in Proton Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) processes. PCET is the key to efficiency in biological photosynthesis. Time-Resolved Infrared spectroscopy (TRIR) assists PCET investigations but it is usually interpreted with harmonic frequency calculations or classical nuclear dynamics simulations on a BO potential energy surface. To gain further physical insights into PCET it is necessary to revise the theoretical framework for spectroscopy, going beyond the BOA and including a quantum treatment for all nuclei. To reach this goal, this project unifies two cutting-edge methods. One is the Nuclear Electronic Orbital (NEO) approach that goes beyond the BOA by including into the electronic structure calculations the PCET transferred proton. The other is the Semiclassical Initial Value Representation technique that simulates IR spectra by accounting for quantum effects, such as the zero-point energy, overtones, or tunneling, for all nuclei, even in large molecular systems. The project will introduce a new post-BOA conceptual picture for vibrational spectroscopy. Specifically, semiclassical nuclear density calculations will be used to tailor new basis sets to efficiently simulate large molecular systems, gradually including many protons and other nuclei in the NEO wavefunction. In this way, a new spectroscopy theory will be developed for the simulation of TRIR spectra at semiclassical accuracy on NEO post-BOA PESs. These advances will be implemented in an open-source code that we employ to study prototypical PCET systems and gain accurate mechanistic information. This new knowledge will foster applied research by exploiting a deeper understanding of the PCET processes.",312678,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy; United States,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Graphene nanoRibbons as Atomically controlled Light sources (Graal),"Since their first on-surface synthesis, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted tremendous interest in the nano-science and technology communities. Their optical properties in particular hold great promise towards robust and controllable atomically thin classical and quantum emitters and for the realization of robust low-dimensional optoelectronic devices. In fact, GNRs combine many of the outstanding characteristics of graphene with an electronic gap, a mandatory property for many applications including light-emitting devices. Whereas theoretical studies discuss in great detail how the optical properties of GNRs may be advantageously controlled through atomic-scale variations of their width, length, and edge shapes, experiments reporting on the excitonic properties of GNRs are scarce, especially those focusing on photon emission. Indeed, because the synthesis of these GNRs is performed directly on metallic surfaces - which in turn causes luminescence quenching - the light emission properties (being classical or quantum) of atomically precise GNRs remain almost unexplored territory. This synthesis method constitutes also a difficulty when it comes to the realization of GNRs-based optoelectronic devices, as efficient strategies to transfer the GNRs are still lacking. To tackle these issues we propose (i) to exploit an unconventional decoupling strategy that we developed recently (Science, 379,2023 - French partner) based on  LT-STM experiments to unravel the atomic-scale classic and quantum emission properties of individual GNRs and (ii) to integrate the most relevant GNRs in photonic and optoelectronic devices thanks to an innovative solution (Swiss partner) aiming at protecting the optical properties of the GNRs by using dry transfer methods. An interdisciplinary consortium composed of internationally recognized surface chemists and physicists from Switzerland (EMPA) and France (IPCMS) is built to address these issues.",311521,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,France; Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Collaborative Research: In-plane Epitaxial Two-Dimensional Chalcogenide Quantum Dots for Tunable Quantum Photonics,"Nontechnical description Quantum confined structures such as quantum wells and quantum dots (QDs) are a key element in a majority of modern electronic and opto-electronic devices ranging from lasers to high-speed photodetectors, and more recently in quantum information sciences where quantum dots form the basis for spin-qubits or quantum light sources. While III-V and II-VI semiconductors have been researched extensively over the years and offer promise to applications, their widespread utility is limited by challenges associated with light extraction from the material and ability to integrate with a silicon platform. The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials has revolutionized the conception and design of electronic heterostructures from that of buried interfaces within lattice matched III-V multi-layer structures to atomically thin van der Waals stacks with arbitrary control over stacking. The project takes this concept further to develop 2D analogues of QD structures via the fabrication of compositionally modulated dots with deep-subwavelength (< 20 nm) dimensions embedded within atomically thin monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide sheets that can be easily integrated into device structures. The research investigates controlled synthesis of the 2D QD structures with varying composition; atomic-scale analysis of structure, chemistry, and defects; and exploration of their electronic and nanophotonic properties. The project forms the thesis research of two Ph.D. students who are co-advised by the principal investigators (PIs). Undergraduate students from the PIs and partner institutions participate in the research during the academic year or through summer research programs. Graduate and undergraduate students are exposed to a rich collaborative research environment through interactions and internships with researchers at government lab facilities. Technical description The development of bright, tunable, easy to scale and integrate quantum light courses stands as a paramount objective for applications ranging from quantum information processing to quantum sensing and metrology. Quantum dots (QDs) and defect emitters are particularly promising candidates for scalable quantum systems since they are based on a semiconductor platform which leverages existing infrastructure. Quantum emitters based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of particular interest due to their ultra-thin nature and van der Waals bonding, which enables high light extraction efficiency and hetero-integration via layer stacking. Approaches pursued thus far to achieve quantum emission from 2D TMDs include controlled defect/impurity introduction, strained nanostructured surfaces and twisted bilayers. This project focuses on the development of a new class of 2D quantum emitters based on in-plane 2D TMD quantum dots embedded within wafer-scale continuous monolayer sheets. The research focuses on two dot/matrix combinations: MoSe2/WSe2 and MoS2/WS2 (Type II band alignment) and MoSe2/WS2 and ReS2/MoS2 (possible Type I alignment). The work encompasses studies of TMD epitaxy on single crystal substrates focused on tuning the size, shape, density and uniformity of dots and the dot/matrix interface providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms of TMD nucleation, lateral growth and heterointerface structure. Comprehensive exploration of the electronic and optical properties of the samples enables new insights into exciton confinement and charge transfer in in-plane heterostructures. A combination of scanning probe based near-field electronic (surface potential and conductance mapping) and optical techniques (Raman and photoluminescence (PL)) are used in conjunction with far-field spectroscopy (reflectance, ellipsometry and PL) and gated measurements to determine the nature of band alignment and exciton confinement in these heterostructures. The project provides fundamental insights into quantum confinement in in-plane TMD heterostructures and lays the groundwork for future development of TMD QDs monolayers for quantum light emission.

Inverse problems based on seismology and magnetohydrodynamics of solar system gas giants,"Revealing the interiors, and constraining the equations of state (describing how materials behave under realistic pressure and temperature conditions), of gas giant planets in the solar system have been important objectives in planetary science, even more so since the detection of many gaseous exoplanets. These exoplanets are being examined to learn more about how the solar system came to be, and to compare the formation of our solar system to those planetary systems. Seismology has been playing a role in obtaining (instantaneous) models of gas giant planets, including their layering and equations of state, while planetary magnetic fields have been informing one further about their interior properties and thermal evolution. This project involves a novel mathematical framework to facilitate gaining new insights in the (new class of) inverse problems associated with seismology and magnetohydrodynamcs describing the generation of magnetic fields through dynamos. The project offers, via collaborations, a unique interdisciplinary educational experience for the students giving them a much broader appreciation of the importance of novel techniques and implications in space exploration. The principal investigator will study inverse problems for revealing the interiors of gas giant planets, that is, Saturn and Jupiter, in the solar system, pertaining to seismology and magnetohydrodynamics. Both are mathematically fundamentally distinct from their treatments on Earth and raise intriguing challenges in their analyses. These inverse problems are defined through systems of linear(ized) partial differential equations describing acoustic-gravitational oscillations and nonlinear partial differential equations describing magnetohydrodynamics (in the Boussinesq approximation) as well as edge operators. The project is foundational, but its significance extends to the data that have and will become available from NASA's Cassini and Juno missions; the investigator collaborates with members of the Science Team of the second mission. The results will contribute to discerning limits and possibilities, including guarantees of reliability or lack thereof.

Structure and Tomography of Hadrons,"Protons and neutrons, collectively known as hadrons, are composite particles made of quarks, which are the fundamental, structureless building blocks of matter. Despite moving within the proton at nearly the speed of light, quarks are confined to the microscopic interior of the proton by the strong force, the most powerful of the four known fundamental interactions in nature, as described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A key challenge in modern nuclear physics is to provide a quantitative understanding of hadron properties through the internal dynamics of quarks within the framework of QCD. The research supported by this project seeks to establish the foundations for describing the structure of hadrons theoretically. The outcomes of this research project will advance knowledge of hadron structure theory and will provide theoretical support for ongoing science programs at state-of-the-art experimental facilities, as well as for future projects such as the future Electron-Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The broader impacts of this project include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, it supports a summer bridge program providing research opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the physics department at the University of Connecticut. The objective of this project is to advance the current understanding of the nonperturbative properties of hadrons in QCD, as described in terms of form factors, parton distribution functions, generalized parton distributions, transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions, and transverse momentum dependent generalized parton distributions. The latter provide an attractive overarching umbrella concept that unifies all the aforementioned hadron properties. These functions serve as powerful tools for describing high-energy processes within QCD factorization frameworks and provide access to a multitude of previously unexplored nucleon properties, such as proton mass and spin decompositions, as well as distributions of energy, internal forces, and orbital angular momentum within the proton. The theoretical research supported by this project focuses on investigating the nonperturbative properties of these functions, including studies of polarized helicity sea quark distribution functions, exploration of chiral symmetry breaking effects in nucleon structure, and analyses of generalized transverse momentum dependent distribution functions within effective field theoretic approaches. The methods employed in this project encompass phenomenological studies, investigations in effective theories and QCD-inspired models. Additionally, the formulation of quasi parton distributions is explored to provide complementary insights and support ongoing lattice QCD studies.

Towards ultra-high dose rates in proton therapy: an ionoacoustic approach for in vivo dose monitoring,"The use of ultra-high dose rates (FLASH) in radiation therapy has emerged as a promising modality to treat cancer due to its unprecedented ability to reduce healthy tissue toxicity while ensuring tumor control. “Towards ultra-high dose RAtes in Proton therapy: an Ionoacoustic approach for in vivo Dose monitoring” (RAPID) project aims at providing new insights into the clinical benefits of proton FLASH radiotherapy by resolving the challenge of real-time dose monitoring. The action represents a powerful instrument to push the boundaries of cancer care with proton radiotherapy at three different levels: i) the optimization of an ionoacoustic imaging system for real-time pulse-based 3D dose monitoring, ii) the experimental evaluation of the physical requirements to achieve the FLASH effect by in vivo and in vitro studies under different beam conditions, and iii) the interpretation and optimization of the ionoacoustic signal response for different treatment plans. The ionoacoustic imaging technique, combined with an ultrasound system, will enable to image simultaneously tissue morphology and dose deposition of the beam. These technological advances will disentangle the complex and multiple variables influencing the yet unknown FLASH effect, as well as enabling the first systematic study combining FLASH dosimetry and tissue damage/toxicity response. The researcher will spend 24 months at the Department of Radiation Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) and 12 months at the Department of Atomic, Molecular and Nuclear Physics at University of Seville (USE, Spain) and Centro Nacional de Aceleradores – National Center of Accelerators, an USE joint research center.",308655,2024,2027,European Commission,Spain; United States; United States,EU,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Chemical Design and Assembly of 2D Molecular-Atomic Lattice vdW Heterostructures for Quantum Emission,"Non-Technical Summary: Quantum materials can be used to address profound challenges in information technology, health, and sustainability. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Thomas Kempa and his group at Johns Hopkins University search for new quantum platforms and focus on using few-atom-thick molecular crystal lattices to manipulate the optical emission properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor layers. An important and unique feature of the quantum materials platform is that the molecular crystal lattice can be chemically modified so that the optical properties of the 2D semiconductor can also be tuned. To build this platform, which could potentially function as a quantum light source, the researchers use chemical design strategies and synthesis of molecular crystal lattices called metal-organic frameworks. They then show how to merge them with 2D semiconductors to yield layered heterostructures. These heterostructures represent a large departure from conventional approaches and could provide a route towards unprecedented materials integration, interface design, and property discovery. These efforts contribute to future quantum technologies that enable more sustainable high-performance computing, more powerful biological and chemical sensors, and more secure communications, all of which serve US national interests. Aside from this, the principal investigator spearheads two outreach efforts intended to educate diverse communities on the practical and ethical impacts of quantum information science, and to educate undergraduate and graduate students how to be more effective communicators of quantitative information through visual media (e.g., slides, figures, simulations). Technical Summary: Quantum materials display a host of intriguing phenomena including superconductivity, giant magnetoresistance, spin liquid states, and single photon emission, to name a few. However, despite great progress, much work remains to develop quantum materials that can address profound and growing societal challenges in information technology, health, and sustainability. Prof. Thomas Kempa and his group at Johns Hopkins University present a new material platform on which to elicit and manipulate quantum emission through atomically-precise control of excitons. The material platform is comprised of two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) layered with 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) creating so-called van der Waals heterostructures. A key feature of the platform is that the 2D MOFs can be chemically tailored to provide periodic potentials with bespoke symmetries, sizes, and strengths. In turn, the interaction of these potentials with a 2D TMD, or other 2D material, can elicit new excitonic phenomena. The research addresses two core objectives focused on (a) chemical design of 2D MOFs with bespoke topology and charge order and (b) assembly of 2D MOFs and 2D TMDs into vdW heterostructures. The proposed vdW heterostructure platform likely represents the first attempt to alter explicitly the exciton landscape within a 2D TMD through a tailored 2D molecular lattice. It also differs markedly from twistronic approaches that elicit moiré potentials, because the strategy Prof. Thomas Kempa and his group use provides for independent, chemically selective control over the potential thereby offering a vast new parameter space for materials integration, interface design, and property discovery. Besides its many intellectual merits, the research has broader impacts by contributing improvements to the performance and sustainability of computing hardware, and by contributing to the education and greater engagement of society with science. The latter impact occurs through two specific outreach efforts: a biannual JHU–Morgan State University “Quantum Computing and Security Workshop” to broaden community awareness of quantum information science, and a freely available training module called “From Data to Impact” that teaches students how to create salient and impactful figures, tables, and graphics. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",307752,2025,2026,NSF,United States,United States,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Quantum Physics
Non-equilibrium dynamics in the Milky Way and Local Group,"The stellar dynamics of the Milky Way and Local Group allows us to infer their composition and history. Furthermore, such gravitational probes constitute a window into one of the greatest mysteries of modern science: the fundamental nature of dark matter. The research field of Galactic dynamics is undergoing a revolution thanks to novel observations, mainly coming from the ESA Gaia survey, which has revealed a variety of non-equilibrium dynamical structures. I propose to develop and apply novel techniques for modelling non-equilibrium dynamics in the Milky Way and Local Group. Although non-equilibrium stellar dynamics is often regarded as an obstacle and liability, it does in fact probe otherwise unobtainable information, such as dynamical signatures that are unique to specific dark matter particle candidates. I propose three ambitious Working Packages (WPs). In the first WP, I will use the recently discovered phase-space spiral in the Milky Way disk in order to measure the global gravitational potential of our Galaxy. The second and third WPs focus on the evolution of tidally perturbed Local Group dwarf galaxy satellites and how they can be used to probe the particle nature of dark matter. The outgoing and return phase institutes, Columbia University and Stockholm University, are home to infrastructure resources and expertise that are highly relevant to this action, such as large-scale galaxy simulations and state-of-the-art simulation-based inference techniques. The combination of host institutes will enable me to build a trans-Atlantic network of collaborators and contacts, which will greatly increase my competitiveness and employability in the academic sector.",305432,2024,2027,European Commission,Sweden; United States,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Superlattices of Perovskite Quantum-Dots for the Digital-age,"Photonic integrated chips are key for the EU’s pursuit of faster and more efficient computers, aiming to support the Digital Revolution while reducing the costs of ICT. However, progress in photonic devices is held back by challenges in the miniaturization of on-chip light sources. SUPER-QD aims to tackle these challenges by using Superlattices of lead halide perovskite Quantum Dots as micron-size on-chip emitters. Thanks to their color-tunable and bright fluorescence, these nanocrystals solids are efficient micron-size light down-converters, that will allow implementing more color channels per device without compromising miniaturization. Moreover, the coupling between quantum dots results in superior exciton mobility and emission from collective quantum states (superfluorescence), which are promising for future applications in transceivers and quantum computers. SUPER-QD comprises four tasks: 1) Quantum Dots prepared via wet chemistry are assembled into Superlattices with tunable structure. 2) Innovative diffraction techniques are employed to characterize Superlattices, with a focus on structural and energetic disorder. 3) Collective optical properties are studied via space- and time-resolved spectroscopies to discover new structure-coupling relations, with the goal of tuning the Superlattices quantum light emission through their structure. 4) Finally, Superlattices with optimized properties will be installed in Integrated Photonic Chips, to demonstrate on-chip down-converting optical amplification upon photoexcitation from an integrated blue laser. These proof-of-concept devices will create new connections between colloidal nanomaterials and photonic integrated chips, leading to groundbreaking advancements in both fields. SUPER-QD will be hosted by Lund University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, leveraging the Fellows’ and Host Institutions’ expertise to ensure a mutual benefit from the Action and the success of the ambitious goals of the project.",305430,2025,2028,European Commission,Sweden; United States,EU,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Quantum Physics
Calibration of Scintillating Bubble Chambers for Dark Matter and CEVNS Detection,"The noble-liquid bubble chamber is a newly developed technology with a unique combination of high sensitivity to particle interactions with atomic nuclei, but extremely low sensitivity to interactions with atomic electrons. The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration will develop this technique and use it in the study of dark matter and neutrinos. While astrophysical observations indicate that most of the matter in the universe is so-called ‘dark matter’, very little is known about the nature of dark matter. The SBC technique is complementary to many other experimental efforts also seeking to directly observe dark matter and would be an especially powerful experimental tool if it turns out that dark matter consists of particles of similar mass to protons – which make up most of the ‘normal matter’ in the universe. This project involves operation support, data analysis and calibration by graduate and undergraduate students at Drexel University of SBC noble-liquid bubble chambers for the low-background detection of sub-keV nuclear recoils. As a neutrino experiment, SBC’s unique capabilities enable the study of elastic scattering of neutrinos off atomic nuclei to reveal new insights. If successfully developed, this technology will enable searches for GeV-scale dark matter particles to the solar neutrino floor, and precision measurements of neutrino properties via coherent elastic scattering (CEvNS) of reactor neutrinos. The SBC Collaboration is commissioning a 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber at Fermilab to calibrate the low-threshold reach of this technology. The unique sensitivity to sub-keV nuclear recoils motivates a novel in-situ calibration approach combining photoneutron sources to induce keV-scale nuclear recoils and an entirely new calibration technique employing elastic scattering of gamma rays to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils. Monte Carlo simulations and data analysis tools developed with this project will be used to interpret the response of the detector to the calibration sources and develop a precision data-driven response model to dark matter particles and neutrinos, enabling the physics goals of the SBC experimental program.

Support for Operations of the LEGEND-200 Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Experiment,"The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (LEGEND) uses an isotope of germanium, Ge-76, to search for a postulated rare decay process known as neutrinoless double beta decay (NLDBD). The observation of NLDBD would reveal the quantum nature of the neutrino, demonstrate matter creation, reveal that neutrinos and antineutrinos are indistinguishable, and offer a potential explanation of the mystery of why we see the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. This NSF grant supports the U.S. portion for operation of the LEGEND-200 experiment, currently collecting data deep underground at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. LEGEND-200 is an international effort, with participation of over 60 institutions in the U.S. and Europe. Over the course of its operation, it should achieve world leading discovery sensitivity for NLDBD. Potential benefits of this research include fundamentally changing our understanding of the nature and origin of matter, should the decay be observed. Additionally, the technology of large, low-background Ge radiation detectors will enable a new generation of highly-efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this technology are: direct dark matter searches; nuclear structure; nuclear astrophysics; environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. Likewise, many of the same fields will benefit from LEGEND’s production of ultra radio-pure materials, with natural U and Th reduced to ultra-low levels. These technology advances will also likely have impacts on non-low-background applications such as nuclear medicine and Homeland Security. In operating and analyzing the data from LEGEND-200, students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained in underground-science-related disciplines, such as low-background techniques, detector technology, nuclear physics and neutrino physics. With the realization that neutrinos have small, non-zero masses there is intense interest in further elucidation of their intrinsic properties including understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism and determining the absolute neutrino mass scale and spectrum. There is also the fundamentally important question – is lepton number conserved? Based on fundamental symmetries, there is nothing that would preclude each neutrino mass eigenstate being identical to its anti-particle, that is: a “Majorana” particle. Experimental evidence of NLDBD decay would demonstrate lepton number violation, definitively establish the Majorana nature of neutrinos, and provide information about the absolute neutrino mass. LEGEND-200 utilizes novel, large high-purity Germanium radiation detectors with an intrinsic energy resolution of 0.1% that are surrounded by low-Z shielding (water and argon). The instrumentation of the liquid argon provides an active veto through the detection of argon scintillation light. This proposal provides U.S. support for the operations of LEGEND-200 from 2024-2028. LEGEND-200 initiated first physics measurements in March of 2023 with 142 kg of installed detectors. The experiment plans to deploy up to 200 kg of detectors, with additional detectors slated to be installed in mid-2024 and 2025. LEGEND-200 will have world leading discovery potential and a half-life sensitivity of 1027 year for a 1 ton-year exposure.

Radiometer based on nonlinear microwave to optical conversion in a resonator.,"The ATESCA (Ambient Temperature Extremely Sensitive Radiometer for CubeSat Applications) project seeks to advance radiometer technology by achieving highly sensitive microwave detection for space-based applications, such as radio astronomy and Earth observation, without the need for cryogenic cooling of the detector. This project is particularly focused on improving the detection of microwave radiation from the ozone of earth’s atmosphere and from the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
ATESCA radiometers utilize a nonlinear optical upconversion process to transfer weak microwave signals into the optical domain. This process is intrinsically noiseless, and it has been shown theoretically that a good signal to noise ratio can be achieved even when the whole setup is sitting at room temperature (opposed to direct detection of the microwave radiation).
The nonlinear upconversion process is intrinsically weak. Hence the team plans to employ whispering gallery mode resonators, which support resonances in both optical and microwave domains to significantly improve conversion efficiency. It has been shown theoretically that with the planned implementation, a photon conversion efficiency from the microwave (> 100GHz) to the optical domain of 1% can be achieved. This will enable the proposed radiometer with high sensitivity but would also be interesting for future quantum technology.
This is a planned collaboration between a group in Madrid, Spain (UC3M) and Dunedin, New Zealand (UoO). The researcher will demonstrate the proposed conversion efficiency and hence sensitivity on a benchtop experiment and, afterwards, will implement the system into two actual payloads for CubeSat missions to demonstrate the radiometer.",304164,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain; New Zealand,EU,Quantum Physics
Super-resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging: mapping (bio)chemical interactions with nanometer resolution,"Super-resolution microscopy has become an essential tool in the life sciences and in chemistry by optically achieving a near-molecular spatial resolution of a few nanometers in living samples. One of its most common implementations is single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), a wide-field technique which relies on the detection of single emitters whose fluorescence is separated in space and time, such as in photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), direct STORM (dSTORM), or point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT).Another indispensable tool in biology and material sciences is fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), a confocal microscopy technique that adds the fluorescence lifetime dimension to intensity and position information acquired by conventional microscopy. The fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore being sensitive to its direct physico-chemical environment, FLIM thus provides functional information with the help of properly calibrated environment-sensitive fluorescent probes which may sense parameters as diverse as pH, polarity, viscosity, ion concentrations, hydration, or membrane tension, thus enabling to map local molecular interactions.The Fürstenberg group has been striving since its launch in 2020 to develop environment-sensitive probes compatible with both SMLM and FLIM for multidimensional super-resolution imaging methods in which not only the position of the probes is recorded, but also a functional dimension based on their spectrum or lifetime. We have developed targetable fluorescent probes based on red-emitting fluorophores compatible with SMLM whose lifetime directly reports on the number of water molecules in their contact sphere, opening the door to counting water molecules in biological environments. In parallel, the group of Stefan Matile within the NCCR Chemical Biology has created fluorophores which sense membrane tension quantitatively through their fluorescence lifetime. They have found broad applications in FLIM and are now commercially available. We demonstrated their compatibility with SMLM. We have however not been able to follow membrane hydration or tension with nanometer resolution due to the lack of experimental scheme combining SMLM and FLIM.Until very recently, it was indeed deemed impossible to record super-resolved images with lifetime information by SMLM, the wide-field techniques completely lacking the lifetime dimension. In 2020, the group of Jörg Enderlein combined for the first time FLIM with SMLM and realized single-molecule localization-based fluorescence lifetime super-resolution imaging (FL-SMLM) by using a fast galvanometric scanner (FLIMBee, PicoQuant) enabling video-rate confocal imaging. In September 2022, the company PicoQuant, specialized in fluorescence lifetime instruments and single-molecule technology, launched a brand-new one-of-its-kind confocal single-molecule microscope (“Luminosa”) with an integrated FLIMBee scanner and additional unique features, thus rendering FL-SMLM for the first time commercially accessible.The goal of this proposal is to fund such an instrument to take both hydration-sensitive and membrane tension probes to the next level. The turn-key Luminosa microscope will enable to perform functional FL-SMLM in biological environments, a field still in its infancy. By combining the power of fluorescence lifetime information and the spatial resolution of SMLM, it will yield an unprecedented resolution into biomolecular processes, interactions, and mechanisms at the nanoscale.",302245,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Advanced muon spin spectroscopy with high lateral resolution using Si pixel detectors,"Measuring sub-millimeter samples using muon spin relaxation/spectroscopy (µSR) is a dream for material scientists, in particular, in the field of novel quantum materials which are difficult to produce in large quantities. In addition, data collection rate at continuous muon sources, which offer high time resolution measurements, have stagnated at 40k incoming muons per second since the development of the technique. In this proposal we aim at developing new concepts for µSR spectrometers which break these limitations ushering in a new era for muon spin spectroscopy and its applications. With recent developments in pixel detector chips used in particle physics experiments, such an concepts become possible for the first time, benefiting from a superb single hit spatial resolution in the detector of 23 µm and a timing resolution better than 15 ns. With this project, other potential breakthroughs for the µSR technique include the ability to (I) obtain magnetic and electronic properties of materials on the sub-millimeter lateral resolution, (II) measure multiple samples in parallel allowing fast and efficient exploration of the phase space of a family of materials, (III) perform pump probe and transient measurements benefiting from the high data collection rate, and (IV) measurements of µSR signals with lower uncorrelated background, allowing longer time window beyond the current 10 µs limit, without sacrificing the high time resolution or data rate. In this research proposal we will demonstrate the feasibility of using thin Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (D-MAPS) chips (˜ 0.5 × 10-3 X/X0) to build a µSR spectrometer that can be operated at a continuous beam of muons at PSI. The technology has been developed in the context of the Mu3e experiment, currently under construction at PSI. This project will demonstrate two key performance aspects of this design: First, the separation of domains with different magnetic properties in custom samples. The target domain sizes will be ~ 1 mm3, allowing also the measurement of multiple samples in parallel. Second, the superb spatial resolution will be used to identify multiple muons implanted in the samples at the same time, enabling an increase of incoming muons rate by more than tenfold and therefore make better use of the highly oversubscribed µSR spectrometers/beamlines at PSI.The implication of this development extends beyond PSI to other µSR facilities worldwide, which can also benefit from it. For example, this development could be used even at pulsed muon sources to enable measurements of smaller samples and higher time resolution. On the physics side, we will be able to measure novel materials produced at small quantities which cannot yet be measured. This development is also crucial for the high intensity muon beams (HIMB) project and its success for the materials science program.",301954,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Thermalization in circuit quantum thermodynamics,"Thanks to advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques, microwave engineering and cryogenics, quantum technology is a fast-growing field of science and industry with great expectations for societal benefits. A quantum bit, qubit, is one of the central elements in the present-day quantum science but most importantly in future quantum information processing. Despite tremendous progress in improving the coherence of qubits, almost a million-fold improvement in 30 years in case of superconducting circuits, they still have to cope with different loss and decoherence mechanisms and they are vulnerable to influences from their environment, which can disrupt and destroy quantum information. With the progress in ultrasensitive nanoscale bolometry in the field of circuit quantum thermodynamics (cQTD), and the intense studies of superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) as one of the leading technologies for the realization of a universal quantum computer, a combination of the two technologies provides a unique platform for studying thermalization and decoherence of e.g., a superconducting qubit in the presence of different environments. On the fundamental side, the goals of the project are in understanding thermalization of open and closed quantum systems formed of superconducting qubits, Josephson junction arrays, and transmission lines, as opposed to true dissipative baths formed of on-chip resistors. On the practical level mesoscopic heat baths in form of calorimeters will be developed by implementing cross-correlation thermometry towards wide-band detection of single microwave photons. On the technological side I will advance my skills to advanced measurements of superconducting qubits and cross-correlation detection of temperature during the outgoing phase of the project in US (Chicago, Caltech, Seattle), and bring this expertise back to my host laboratory in Finland.",301538,2024,2027,European Commission,Finland; United States; United States; United States,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
"Gaps, Cavities, and Vortices: Carving Disks with Planets and Radiation","Disk features like gaps and cavities are commonly attributed to planets. But other mechanisms can create similar features, e.g. the radiation pressure instability, resulting from fundamental interactions of radiation, gas, and dust. Moreover, even when planets are the root cause of the disk’s features, such instabilities can be triggered. That effect needs to be taken into account to infer planetary properties using the features. Researchers at Clemson University, in the EPSCoR state of South Carolina, are funded to study these physical systems with PEnGUIn, an open-source, aggressively optimized hydrodynamics code that runs on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). They aim to produce a unified picture of the co-evolution of super-Earth systems and their natal disks. The project will also design and carry out interdisciplinary projects with art students, giving scientists and artists a chance to learn from each other. It will also enhance the Emerging Scholar program at Clemson, promoting college-culture in the underprivileged areas of South Carolina. The dynamics of radiation-gas-dust interaction in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks, with or without planets, still has many unknowns. Accurate simulations of these systems will require either high resolution to track complex gas flow in the disks, or tracking long term evolution over millions of years, or both. This project develops a more physically-motivated thermal treatment to replace the commonly assumed isothermal equation of state or simple thermal relaxation prescription. The researchers will study whether planet-shepherded rings remain stable against the Rossby wave instability. They will study whether super-Earths, the most abundant type of known planets, can open large cavities in disks; if so, the rarer giant planets will not need to be invoked to explain cavities. They will also study whether planets may drive disk evolution by quantifying the amount of planet-induced disk transport and whether gapped disks may turn into transition disks. Working with art students in both fine arts and in digital arts, art-pieces will be produced that can be used to engage the public. As part of the Emerging Scholar program, the PI will help design and teach summer classes for high school students and provide them with research opportunities within this project.

Research in Theoretical Nuclear and Neutrino Physics,"Neutrinos are weakly interacting electric charge neutral particles that are produced in copious amounts in the stars, supernova explosions, and neutron-star mergers. As such they easily transport excess energy and entropy away from those objects. The PI and their graduate students will study the interaction of neutrinos with their background particles as well as with each other in these astrophysical environments using both conventional techniques of neutrino many-body theory and tools from quantum information science. Theoretical research in those areas has a close coupling with ongoing state-of-the-art experimental and observational programs in the United States and abroad. Previously the PI and their students considered neutrino transport in astrophysical object within the two-flavor approximation, mapping two neutrino mass eigenstates onto up and down states of a qubit. Since neutrinos come in three flavors this approximation is inadequate and one needs to map three mass eigenstates onto qutrits. The team will develop the description of neutrino collective oscillations using qutrits. Since neutrinos control the value of the electron fraction, one can expect that different treatments of neutrino transport would result in different nucleosynthesis scenarios. Preliminary work showed that neutrino oscillations amplify the shift from proton-rich to neutron-rich nucleosynthesis and can result in a full intermediate neutron capture process. The team will explore the consequences of this “nu-i process” in detail. The PI with their collaborators will explore how neutrino spin-flavor precession gives feedback to the core-collapse supernova dynamics. The team will apply the statistical data assimilation technique, an inference procedure wherein a dynamical system is assumed to underlie any measured quantities, to the neutrino transport in the Sun (where much data are available) and core-collapse supernovae (using data from modeling).

Precision Global Modeling of Exotic Hadrons,"The strong nuclear force, responsible for binding protons and neutrons tightly together in the atomic nucleus, has long been understood at its core to be explained by the interactions of particles called ""quarks"" that form compounds called ""hadrons"". Until 2003, all hadrons appeared as compounds of a quark and an antiparticle quark (mesons) or three-quark compounds (baryons, like protons and neutrons). Since then, scores of ""exotic"" 4-quark or 5-quark hadrons have been discovered, but no simple picture has yet been developed that describes how they are assembled. This project continues the development of a promising universal model of exotic hadrons, the dynamical diquark model (DDM), which has successfully described a number of exotic hadrons as compounds in which the components themselves are bound two-quark subunits (diquarks). Recent work on this model has been to combine the diquark compounds with effects caused by the presence of two-meson components with which they can mix (the DDM diabatic extension). In this project the PI and his students will develop diabatic techniques for precise predictions of measurable properties for the full spectrum of exotic hadrons, including predictions of yet-unseen exotics. This project addresses three major scientific lines of inquiry and one of intense public interest: First, the project will build on prior work to describe the exotics sector using the diabatic dynamical diquark mode (DDM)l. Second, the PI will mentor a PhD student on including effects from two-meson states mixing that depend upon those states' spin quantum numbers, thus creating the most advanced model of exotics to date. Third, the PI will apply the diabatic DDM to study open-heavy-flavor exotics such as the recently observed doubly-charmed T_cc meson that contains two charm -- and no anti-charm -- quarks. In addition, this project will help address a critical shortage of high-school physics teachers in Arizona by leveraging the establishment of Arizona State University's first-in-the-nation online Bachelor of Science in Physics degree program. Under the PI's guidance an established Arizona high-school science teacher will have the opportunity to gains the skills necessary for physics teaching certification in Arizona.

Bessel functions on higher-rank groups,"Classical Bessel functions arise as solutions to certain differential equations and appear throughout mathematics and the sciences. There are numerous books on their properties and behaviors and descriptions as integrals, series, and so on. They appear in number theory through formulas of Voronoi, Petersson and Kuznetsov. In particular, the formula of Kuznetsov, also known as a relative trace formula, gives connections between interesting objects in analysis and algebra/geometry. This research studies the generalizations of Kuznetsov's formula and the generalized Bessel functions that appear in such formulas, with the goal of building a body of knowledge similar to what is known about the classical Bessel functions. This will allow analytic number theorists to explore the applications of these new Kuznetsov-type formulas. Part of the funding for the project will be used to support undergraduate and master's-level research in analytic number theory. While the Kuznetsov formula for SL(2) has been the subject of intense research for the past 40 years, much less is known about its generalizations to reductive groups. These generalizations relate the exponential sums occurring in the Fourier coefficients of Poincare series to the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms and the integral transforms in these generalized Kuznetsov formulas can, conjecturally, be expressed as kernel integral transforms; the kernels are generalized Bessel functions. This research aims to extend the study of Bessel functions to groups such as GL(n) and GSp(n). The immediate goals are to study their differential equations, integral representations and give basic asymptotics of their integral transforms in low-rank groups such as GL(4) and GSp(4). Long-term goals for the project include extending these results to arbitrary rank and applications such as the arithmetically-weighted Weyl law. Smaller, associated projects on GL(3) include studying the Poincare series occurring in the GL(3) Fourier expansion, application of the Kuznetsov formula to the supremum norm problem as well as the relationship between vector sup norms and scalar sup norms for Maass forms with weight. This project is jointly funded by Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Renormalization, dynamics, and spontaneous symmetry breaking","The renormalization group method is a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics, explaining a vast range of central phenomena from areas spanning from elementary particle to solid state physics and beyond. The main idea is the analysis of an effective description of a theory at different length scales, leading to a dynamics as the scale varies---the renormalization group dynamics. The mathematics of the renormalization group however is only well understood in very few cases. One of the main goals of this project is to develop mathematical methods and examples of the renormalization group in different contexts. Graduate students wills be mentored as part of the project; the awardee will present courses on relevant material and make their lecture notes available, and also participate in outreach programs for K12 students. The main focus of this proposal is on the use of the renormalization group method in two contexts, the small and large scale properties of stochastic dynamics of statistical field theories, and the mathematics of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, in particular in the example of the OSp(1|2) non-linear sigma model. In a complementary direction, some examples of integrable quantum field theories will be explored as well.

Special Functions of p-adic Algebraic Groups and Quantum Groups,"This is a project to develop connections between number theory and physics. A modern paradigm in number theory uses highly symmetric functions to answer the most fundamental questions about solutions of equations in several variables. Quite surprisingly, these same symmetries arise in physics, particularly statistical mechanics, where one seeks to determine global behavior of molecules based on local interactions between particles. The PI, collaborators, and students, will explain and explore further mathematical consequences of this connection. The project will provide research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. More precisely, the bridge between number theory and statistical mechanics alluded to above is the theory of quantum groups and most of the specific projects pursued will use the representation theory of quantum group modules. To make connections with special functions in number theory, particularly matrix coefficients of algebraic groups over local fields, one needs new results on quantum group modules. The PI and collaborators will use quantum affine Lie superalgebra modules to produce lattice models with the required symmetry used in the study of matrix coefficients for metaplectic groups. In reverse, by expressing new classes of special functions from representation theory as partition functions of solvable lattice models, one obtains conjectural invariants of multi-parameter quantum groups. The primary scientific goals include deeper insight from quantum groups into various aspects of the Langlands program.

Quantitative symplectic geometry and dynamics,"This project will facilitate development of new tools to study mathematical questions related to how physical systems evolve in time. A state of the system corresponds to a point in an even dimensional phase space, and the system evolves along an odd dimensional energy level in the phase space. A particular focus will be placed on understanding the existence and properties of periodic orbits, which describe behavior that repeats in time, especially in the case when the phase space is four dimensional and the energy level is three dimensional. The geometry of the phase space will also be studied, developing methods to determine when one dynamical system is equivalent to another one by a change of coordinates. Various research projects on these topics will provide research training for graduate students in the latest techniques in symplectic geometry and related areas of mathematics. The PI will also engage in multiple outreach activities. Specific projects include the following. Filtrations on embedded contact homology will be studied with the goal of proving in full generality that every contact form on a closed three-manifold has either two or infinitely many simple Reeb orbits. Knot filtered embedded contact homology will be studied with applications to symplectic cobordisms between transverse knots. Symplectic invariants of open domains arising from barcodes in equivariant symplectic homology will be used to classify some open domains up to symplectomorphism. Closing lemmas will be extended to more general vector fields than Reeb vector fields in three dimensions. Universal quantitative invariants will be developed with applications to symplectic embedding problems, constraints on Lagrangian submanifolds, refinements of the Arnold chord conjecture, elementary spectral invariants of contact manifolds, and comparisons between symplectic capacities.

Quantum Aspects of Matter Fields and Matter,"Quantum entanglement is a distinctive feature of quantum systems, presenting a novel resource for fundamental science and technology. In contemporary laboratories, entanglement is systematically generated and controlled across diverse systems. These advancements are progressively influencing technology, with entanglement being a cornerstone in the field of quantum technologies, set to revolutionize various aspects of daily life. Although most advances have been primarily restricted to non-relativistic systems, progress is starting to extend into the domain of relativistic quantum mechanics. This research project aims to deepen our understanding of entanglement in relativistic quantum field theories with special emphasis on the role of gravity in this structure. The goals include combining advancements in theory and technology to experimentally validate aspects of the intricate relationship between quantum entanglement and the geometry of spacetime. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration with experimental groups, the project seeks to influence quantum technologies and train new researchers. Additionally, it includes an outreach program targeting the general public and local schools in Baton Rouge, particularly those serving minority and underrepresented communities. The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of entanglement in quantum field theories in curved spacetimes and quantum gravity. A primary objective is to understand the role of spacetime geometry in the entanglement content of typical quantum states of matter. The project is composed of a set of interconnected subprojects, encompassing different aspects of the interplay between quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, quantum information, and quantum gravity. These sub-projects include (i)Theoretical exploration of the entanglement structure in both flat and curved spacetimes, with a focus on finite sets of degrees of freedom. (ii) Investigating the potential to probe the entanglement of the quantum vacuum using relativistic particle detectors. (iii) Studying entanglement generation in rapidly rotating systems, including black holes, and collaborating with experimentalists to achieve experimental confirmation. (vi) Investigating laboratory systems capable of verifying the generation of entangled pairs by time-dependent geometries. Each subproject is self-contained, but collectively they work synergistically to push the boundaries of this important and timely research area.

Bayesian Model Averaging for Nuclear Effective Field Teories,"Proton-proton fusion is a critical reaction in the sun in which two protons react to form a deuteron under the emission of a positron and a neutrino. This rate is very small so it cannot be measured on Earth, and theoretical calculations are necessary. These calculations provide predictions for the rate that are important for solar simulations that impact, for example, the total amount of radiated neutrinos. Different approaches are currently being used to calculate this rate, each with its own uncertainties. In the past, combining the predictions and uncertainties obtained with different approaches has been challenging as differences between different methods are hard to compare. With this project, the PI and their team will study the application of the Bayesian model averaging technique to combining predictions for the proton-proton fusion rate into a single result with a reliably quantified uncertainty. Proton-proton fusion is the first process to be considered, as the PI and their team will apply this modern statistical technique to other processes of interest in nuclear physics, such as the nuclear structure induced Lamb and hyperfine shifts in atomic deuterium. Various observables in nuclear physics are calculated using different models for nuclear interactions. In particular, two approaches are used in the few-body sector: Pionless effective field theory and chiral effective field theory. These effective field theories are low-energy expansions in two different parameters reflecting the scale separations present in nuclear systems. These expansions are used to obtain results up to a desired order, where the largest omitted order provides an estimate of the theory uncertainty. To obtain a single result for an observable and reliable uncertainty estimates, the team will use Bayesian model averaging to obtain predictions for the pp-fusion rate with Bayesian uncertainties using chiral and pionless effective field theories. The team will then consolidate the Bayesian model averaging predictions, providing an accurate framework for theoretical calculations in nuclear physics. This approach will be extended to other observables that can be calculated using effective field theories, such as nuclear structure induced line shifts in atom deuterium.

EAGER: Quantum-inspired Electronic Structure,"Nick Mayhall of Virginia Tech is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop quantum-inspired electronic structure theory methods. Computational chemistry has become an invaluable resource for predicting and understanding the microscopic origins of chemical reactivity and structure. While both computer hardware and simulation algorithms have witnessed continued improvements over the years, many chemistry problems remain unanswered due to insurmountable computational costs, a situation which has fueled intense interest in leveraging quantum computation for solving chemistry problems. However, because of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computers, chemistry simulation methods can’t simply be ported from classical over to quantum devices, making it necessary to design altogether new algorithms for deployment on quantum devices. In this project, Nick Mayhall and his research group will leverage ideas and components found in these new quantum algorithms to develop novel classical algorithms for chemistry simulation on currently available classical computers. The goal is to find ways to make use of these quantum algorithmic advances now, instead of waiting until reliable and accurate quantum computers become available. This work will provide publicly available, open-source software, while also addressing our nation’s need for quantum workforce development. Nick Mayhall and his research group will adapt techniques developed for ‘noisy intermediate-scale quantum’ (NISQ) circuit simulations to make them suitable for accelerating electronic structure calculations on classical computers. This project is divided into 3 main objectives: 1) the development of efficient algorithms and open-source software to compute Heisenberg picture expectation values to accelerate the computation of relevant observables like molecular energy, 2) the development electronic structure methods that exploit the unique aspects of the Heisenberg picture computations, and 3) the application of NISQ error mitigation techniques to improve the classical methods developed. The methods developed in this project will be implemented into open-source software, while providing QIS training to chemistry students and postdocs to continue our efforts to help strengthen the quantum workforce.

EAGER: Understanding the Equilibrium or Non-Equilibrium Status of Permanent Fluidic Magnets,"Non-Technical Abstract This project investigates network-forming suspensions of ferromagnetic colloids. It offers insights and strategies for designing, programming, and controlling both the microstructure and the macroscopic magnetic and mechanical functionalities of these systems. Technological potential broader impacts of this work include bioelectronic devices, benefiting areas of health care and liquid robotics. It also provides rich and novel colloidal physics and may provide a novel perspective on equilibrium gelation. Technical Abstract Network-forming suspensions of ferromagnetic colloids, which are coined ""permanent fluidic magnets"" (PFM), are distinct from well-studied ferrofluids due to the use of larger particles and highly viscous solvents, which suppress Brownian motion and sedimentation. Following application of an external magnetic field, the particles assemble into an anisotropic network structure (i.e., an anisotropic gel), and the material acquires a remnant magnetization. Specifically, this EAGER proposal aims to test experimentally, with theoretical comparisons, the question of whether the anisotropic networks are equilibrium states or rather arrested or jammed ones. These experiments would be complemented by both simulations and theory.

Multiatom-Multiphoton Effects,"The PI and graduate students will use computer simulations to understand how light interacts with many atoms. The light will simultaneously interact with many cold atoms in a gas when the atoms are closer together than the wavelength of the light. Having many atoms interact simultaneously with the light leads to new effects that are nothing like when light interacts with one atom at a time. Some of these effects are interesting in their own right and some are possibly useful for quantum information science. Because of the quantum nature of this system, interesting and/or important effects can be amplified well beyond what would be expected from classical objects. The team will investigate three different combinations of light and atoms that could lead to the most interesting or useful effects. This project is also an ideal training ground for theoretically minded graduate and undergraduate students. All students develop their own programs to explain different aspects of a possible experiment and present their results to other scientists and the general public. They perform all tasks of physics research, growing as scientists in the process. The team of PI and students will simulate the collective interaction of many atoms with light, emphasizing many body interactions that can affect quantum-based transmission and manipulation. When atoms in a gas are cold and separated by distances of order the wavelength of the photon (or smaller), the photon interacts with many atoms simultaneously leading to qualitatively new behavior compared to when the atoms are hot or are widely separated. These new effects can serve as interesting advances relevant for quantum information science (QIS). Also, this many-body, open system leads to a richness in the physics that can be different from when many atoms interact through conservative potentials. In one group of projects, the team will explore the effect where photons interacting with an array of atoms leads to momentum and energy transferred to the atoms’ center-of-mass motion. As one example, the team will study how the photon recoil affects the lifetime of strongly subradiant states proposed as QIS elements: the phases of excited states can be chosen so the rate of photon emission is suppressed but this necessarily leads to forces on the atoms which modify the phases. In another example, the team will study the possibility for using the collective interaction with photons to enhance the cooling of atom arrays; atom arrays have been proposed as the starting point for quantum simulators and as elements in quantum computers. A second group of projects will investigate the behavior of light in waveguides interacting with many quantum systems for both quantum simulator applications and possible interesting sources of light. As one example, the team will investigate the character of the light after interacting with several transmons attached to a 1D microwave waveguide where preliminary calculations indicate interesting photon correlations. Another example uses many transmons attached to a 1D waveguide as a quantum simulator of an open many-body system. A last example uses atom arrays to couple to a nano-ring resonator as possible elements for transporting photons or generating interesting photon correlations. A third group of projects explores the possibility for experimentally accessible quantum simulator of open, many-body systems. The projects will explore aspects of a many-body system that is both driven and open to collective decay. As an example, in a symmetrical case, the steady state of a strongly driven gas qualitatively changes under infinitesimal perturbations.

DFG-NSF Physics: Maximizing the Science Return of Target of Opportunity Observations Connected to Compact Binary Mergers,"One of the key questions in astrophysics today is how to discover and characterize the coalescence of compact binary systems, such as black holes and neutron stars. A crucial aspect is connecting expectations for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave signals. This award will enhance existing search strategies and improve the analysis of upcoming discoveries by increasing the speed of analysis algorithms and incorporating these expectations into searches for those counterparts. It will also facilitate student exchange between the University of Minnesota and the University of Potsdam in Germany, providing invaluable multicultural research experiences for young researchers. Given the extensive searches for further binary neutron star mergers, there is an urgent need for improvements in the speed and quality of data products provided to the community. For this reason, the award focuses on (i) Extending existing multi-messenger Bayesian inference software to rapidly predict electromagnetic counterparts while minimizing computational costs during gravitational-wave inference; (ii) Using these advancements to improve searches for multi-messenger sources; (iii) Predicting observing scenarios for future observing runs and the third generation of gravitational-wave detectors; (iv) Analyzing ongoing gravitational-wave observing runs. The award will fund training for students at the intersection of multiple fields, offering a unique opportunity to train a new generation of international scientists who can become key players in the near future.

Oregon Experimental Relativity Group: Characterizing and Mitigating Environmental Influences to Improve LIGO's Astrophysical Sensitivity,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. The era of gravitational wave astronomy began with NSF's LIGO announcement of the detection of a black hole merger in 2016. This first detection led to a Nobel prize and spectacularly confirmed predictions of general relativity, but it also opened a new window into the universe. We have since seen an amazing show through this new window: a cosmos continuously punctuated by collisions that, in energy, briefly outshine all of the stars in the universe. These dozens of black hole merger detections have allowed scientists to make ever-improving independent estimates of the age and expansion of the universe, and an ever-improving understanding of the population of black holes and the death of stars. The detection of a neutron star merger in 2017 triggered radio and other telescopes to observe the aftermath, which, among other things, increased our understanding of the source of heavy elements like gold. In the future, continued observations, and increasing sensitivity will predictably promote the progress of science and our understanding of the universe, and, perhaps, reveal un- predicted phenomena. The awardees will help make these discoveries by helping to increase the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors by studying and mitigating environmental influences (vibration, magnetic fields, radio waves, etc.) on the LIGO detectors. The team will train students in STEM areas. In order to further increase sensitivity, LIGO must overcome known noise sources but also unknown and unexpected noise sources, many of which are driven by the environment. The proposed research will further the identification and mitigation of environmentally driven mystery noise sources that keep the detectors from reaching their design sensitivity. The result will be that the detector becomes more sensitive and can see further into space, enabling new discoveries. The awardees will increase sensitivity for 200-300 solar mass black hole in-spirals, by developing characterization and mitigation techniques for scattered light noise, increase sensitivity to gravitational wave bursts and to stochastic backgrounds by developing methods to reduce the noise produced by lightning strokes thousands of kilometers away, increase sensitivity to continuous wave and transient sources by characterizing and mitigating electronics grounding fluctuation noise, and vet O4 gravitational wave candidates for environmental influences.

Compactifications of moduli spaces and their tropicalizations,"Algebraic geometry is the study of spaces that can be described as solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Circles, parabolae, and hyperbolae are all examples, from classical plane geometry, of shapes which are governed by defining polynomials, in these cases polynomials in two variables. In algebraic geometry, the deep connection between algebra (the defining polynomials) and geometry (the resulting shape) is key. Both recently and over the past century, a large effort has been focused on the study of some very particular spaces of long-standing interest, called moduli spaces, of curves and abelian varieties. These are parameter spaces for certain kinds of geometric objects, and they have deep connections throughout geometry, as well as to mathematical physics and combinatorics. This project will develop and employ modern techniques to make new progress on the study of such spaces. The project will also provide research training opportunities for students. This research program is centered on compactifications of moduli spaces and their tropicalizations, i.e., the instantiations of these moduli spaces in the field of tropical geometry. The project uses tropical moduli spaces, which are certain polyhedral complexes, as a geometric instantiation of the boundary combinatorics of an appropriately compactified moduli space. The existence of the tropical space allows the application of combinatorial-geometric techniques, as well as connections to the study of the cohomology of arithmetic groups.

Analysis of Fluids and Nonlinear Waves,"Partial differential equations (PDE) are widely used to model various problems involving spatial and temporal variables arising in physics, engineering, biology, finance, etc. The aims of the efforts to understand rigorously these mathematical models are twofold. On the one hand, the physical relevance and the validity of these ideal models are established through the comparison between the results from theoretical analysis and the experimental observations. On the other hand, once the meaningfulness of a mathematical model is supported by available experimental data to certain extent, the theoretical studies on these ideal models can provide properties and predictions of the original physical problems that are difficult to obtain from experiments. For physical systems involving temporal evolution, of particular interest are certain structural and asymptotic properties. These include special structures, such as equilibria, periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, chaotic orbits, and their qualitative properties like stability or asymptotic stability. In general, on the one hand, only stable states are physically observable in a system, while the ideal, but unstable, states are hardly observed due to their extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters. On the other hand, unstable states are also very important, in part because they and some of their associated structures serve as the boundaries separating different collections of stable states in a system. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) plans to focus on the local dynamics near steady states in several classical nonlinear PDE systems which belong to the general category of nonlinear waves and incompressible fluids. The complicated nonlinearity poses tremendous challenges in their mathematical analysis. A substantial part of the project is suitable for graduate students and postdocs and provides research training opportunities for these early-career mathematicians. More specifically, the project will study the dynamics of incompressible fluid PDE (inviscid, weakly viscous, or with density stratification) with free surfaces as well as a class of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE. They are standard models arising in fluids, atmosphere-oceans, nonlinear waves, etc. Their solution flows generate infinite dimensional dynamical systems in function spaces. There has been extensive research on these systems with many important advances in recent years. However, due to the complicated spectra of the linearized problems, the highly nonlinear nature, regularity issues, and the multiple scales in space and time they involve, many questions, including some fundamental ones, are still not well understood. First, the PI will work on the two-dimensional water waves linearized at shear flows, including the bifurcation of instability and the linear inviscid damping for the gravity water waves and the spectra and linear flows of the stratified water waves. The second focus of the project is the nonlinear local dynamics of a class of Hamiltonian PDE including the local invariant manifolds for quasilinear Hamiltonian PDE, where the regularity issue poses a major challenge, and the unfolding bifurcation of small homoclinic type solutions in a singular perturbation framework. The PI will also study a potential flow approximation to weakly viscous water waves including formal justification via detailed multi-scale expansions involving boundary layers followed by rigorous proofs. Understanding and solving these problems, expected to be largely based on their specific mechanical and geometric structures, would result in substantial theoretical advances in these areas and possibly lead to the discovery of new physical and mathematical phenomena in the underlying systems.

"Nucleon Structure, Fundamental Symmetries, and Quantum Entanglement in Lattice QCD","Nucleons are made of quarks and gluons tied together by strong interaction and governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). At the hadron scale, quarks are ""dressed"" with gluons and generate 99% of the nucleon mass. In this regime, only numerical calculations on a lattice can reliably reproduce the nucleon masses, internal distributions of charge and magnetization, and the rate of neutron beta-decay. Based on fundamental theory, lattice QCD predictions will be valid at any scale from hadrons to quarks and vital to our understanding of the internal organization of nuclear matter, in particular the transition from phenomenological hadron models to perturbative QCD at short distances. This transition will be explored in this project in three ways. First,the nucleon electromagnetic form factors will be computed in a wide range of high momentum to allow comparison with recent experiments at JLab/CEBAF. Second, quantum entanglement of gauge degrees of freedom will be examined in a color flux tube, which is the most basic ground state binding a quark and antiquark. Finally, the effect of certain charge-parity-violating interactions on the neutron electric dipole moment will be studied, yielding a window from nuclear physics into new particles and fields. Protons and neutrons, which constitute the nuclei of all elements, are themselves composite objects. It has been firmly established that they are built from strongly-bound elementary quarks and gluons. However, this picture is not complete without understanding how the latter are kept in such compact arrangements, especially surprising because they are nearly free at short distances. This project will use fundamental theory to explore the structure of quark-gluon bound states (hadrons) that are central to nuclear physics. First, electric charge and magnetization distributions in the nucleons will be computed with the highest possible resolution. These calculations will accompany recent measurements at Jefferson Lab and help understand how quark-gluon interaction changes at shorter distances. Second, quantum information and entanglement in gluon fields between a quark and antiquark will be studied. Such gluon fields are known to form a so-called color flux tube emerging when one of the quarks is pulled out from a hadron. Finally, the study of neutron structure is vital to detecting effects of yet undiscovered particles. Some of them may be revealed in measurements of electric dipole moments and further improve our knowledge of elementary particles, which presently lacks explanation for dark matter and neutrino masses.

Collaborative Research: MATH-DT: Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Digital Twins,"This project develops, analyzes, and deploys Quantum Digital Twins (QDTs), which are digital clones of existing quantum computers. Built within a comprehensive mathematical and statistical framework, these QDTs will enable bidirectional interactions between quantum computers and virtual models on classical systems, optimizing quantum performance and marking a significant step toward achieving the proverbial Quantum Leap in computational abilities. This advancement will help maintain the United States' leadership in quantum information science and technology, supporting the National Quantum Initiative Act and producing next-generation quantum-enabled technologies for sensing, information processing, communication, security, and computing. Additionally, the project establishes foundations that can enhance other Digital Twin technologies across various fields, from energy to health. It will also facilitate the interdisciplinary training of young scientists in modern data-driven computational methods and the experimental and theoretical aspects of quantum devices and digital twins, with outreach efforts to local communities and Native American tertiary colleges. The QDTs developed in this project aim to overcome the limitations of traditional quantum simulations, which use a linear component-by-component approach, by introducing four key advancements: (i) the first-ever mathematical formulation of QDTs grounded in a Bayesian probabilistic framework, addressing the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum devices, (ii) new randomized Bayesian experimental design techniques tailored for QDTs, capable of handling the complex dynamics and uncertainties in quantum systems, (iii) a robust generalized Bayesian framework using optimal transportation theory with adaptive prior and model enrichment mechanisms, enabling QDTs to detect and correct their flaws while minimizing system downtime, and (iv) advanced risk-neutral techniques for quantum optimal control and validation, improving QDTs' ability to generate high-fidelity quantum gates. The project also integrates these algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products, demonstrating and disseminating the developed QDTs.

"Abelianization, Higgs Bundles and Conformal Blocks","The PI studies problems of geometry using methods imported from particle physics. This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, the PI aims to prove new formulas for solutions of an equation first studied by Einstein, describing the geomery and curvature of space-time. The second part concerns the physics of two-dimensional systems which have ""scale invariance,"" meaning they look the same both at short and long distances. The PI aims to study these systems by reducing them to simpler ones which can be solved exactly. The results of this work will be disseminated broadly both in the mathematics and high-energy physics communities, helping to bring these two areas closer together. The PI will continue outreach through expository lectures and articles. The project will also contribute to the training of graduate students in mathematics. In joint work with Davide Gaiotto and Greg Moore, the PI introduced a conjectural picture of the hyperkahler geometry of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles. Parts of the conjecture have been verified over the last several years, in the work of various authors, including the PI. Building on this recent progress, the PI will make a direct attack on proving the conjecture, as well as a detailed numerical study of the hyperkahler metric in a particular example. The PI will also employ a new approach to the construction of conformal blocks for the Virasoro vertex algebra and more generally the W(gl(N)) vertex algebras. Conformal blocks are much-studied functions arising in two-dimensional conformal field theory, which are notoriously difficult to describe in explicit terms. The new approach the PI will use involves a new technique of abelianization, which relates complicated vertex algebras to simpler ones.

Covering both plasma astrophysics and magnetically confined plasma and fusion research, this REU Site will bring together the capabilities of both the Applied Physics and Astrophysics departments at Columbia University to provide a compelling intellectual environment and strong cohort experience for six to eight summer undergraduate students interested in this vibrant sub-field. We will engage students in primarily physics majors in both experimental and computational research activities. Students will be supported for a ten-week summer program to carry out a variety of research tasks relating to the aforementioned topics, enable them to gain direct exposure to cutting edge research in plasma physics. Through these efforts the project will contribute to the broader development of the nation’s scientific workforce. This REU Site will be the first and thus far only REU Site dedicated to plasma physics and fusion research. Both fundamental astrophysical plasma physics and applied fusion-inspired plasma physics research will be conducted within this REU site. The student projects will be linked by the common language of plasma physics: magneto-hydrodynamics, plasma waves, and kinetic theory. The cohort-level experience will center on these common elements. Columbia’s program supports a range of on-campus experiments, including three-dimensional plasma confinement devices called ‘stellarators’, two toroidally axisymmetric devices called ‘tokamaks’, and a burgeoning fusion clean energy technology program. Columbia’s magnetic confinement theoretical and computational program involves the study of plasma equilibrium, stability, and transport processes. Columbia's plasma astrophysics program studies plasma phenomena occurring in a broad range of astrophysical systems ranging from the Sun and the solar wind up to high energy relativistic systems like pulsars, active galactic nuclei, accretion disks, and supernovae. Students will be assigned to either experimentally-oriented (hands-on) or computationally-oriented projects across these areas. As a cohort, all students will be expected to engage with one-another and regularly communicate their findings to their peers.

New Developments in High Energy Nuclear Physics,"Among the four fundamental forces in nature the strong nuclear force is the least understood. It is responsible for many important processes in our Universe. One particularly important aspect is the existence of quark-gluon plasma. If ordinary matter is heated up to temperatures of about 1,000,000,000,000 degrees, hotter than the core of the sun, atoms cease to exist and protons and neutrons inside nuclei melt. The resulting plasma of quarks and gluons filled the very early Universe. We can recreate this plasma in the laboratory by colliding heavy nuclei at high energies. Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the US study quark gluon plasma. The PI and his group carry out research that improves our understanding of properties of quark-gluon plasma in nuclear collisions. A particular focus lies on the mechanism of quarks and gluons arranging themselves back into protons and other bound states, a process called hadronization. It is those latter particles that are measured in experiments. Therefore, it is critical to develop a quantitative understanding of hadronization, in order to study quark-gluon plasma in experiments. This project provides training for graduate students in nuclear science. This project seeks systematic improvements to the modelling of hadronization using the Hybrid Hadronization model which has recently been developed. It addresses the treatment of spin and angular momentum in hadronization which is currently understood rather poorly. There are immediate applications of results to nucleus-nucleus collisions, where a significant amount of angular momentum is present in off-center collisions, but also to proton-proton and electron-proton collisions, where the study of the spin structure of the proton is a key goal of the experimental programs. The project also improves the treatment of baryons in Hybrid Hadronization by implementing the full spectrum of excited baryons, as recent experimental results involving baryons have created challenges to existing hadronization models. Another key component is the introduction of an important new layer regarding the study of jets, which are used to probe quark-gluon plasma and cold nuclear matter. By studying, for the first time, the hadronic interactions of jets in an ambient medium missing physics is added to state-of-the-art simulations. This will improve the accuracy of any quantitative conclusions extracted from jet measurements.

A Unified Description of Flat Space Holography,"One of the most challenging open questions in theoretical physics consists in describing quantum mechanics and gravity in a unified framework. Important progress has been made towards this goal with the development of the holographic principle, whose most concrete realization is the AdS/CFT correspondence. Although AdS/CFT is the duality that has attracted the most attention, the holographic principle is believed to be much more general and to hold for other kinds of asymptotics, including for the more realistic model of four-dimensional (4d) asymptotically flat spacetime. In this regard, two proposals of flat space holography have emerged. The first consists of a 4d/3d duality, where 4d gravity is dual to a 3d Carrollian CFT living on the null boundary of the spacetime. The second is a 4d/2d duality, where 4d gravity is dual to a 2d conformal field theory, called celestial CFT, living on the celestial sphere.

The aim of this research project is to make major steps towards a holographic description of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime. To do so, we plan to provide a unified description of flat space holography by exploring the relation between the two above proposals and connecting them with the AdS/CFT correspondence through a flat limit process.  Four main lines of research will be investigated: (i) the relation between 3d Carrollian CFT and 2d celestial CFT, (ii) the representations of the BMS group acting in the dual theories, (iii) the flat limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and (iv) the construction of explicit candidates for the dual theories. 

This project involves a transfer of knowledge between the host institutions and the researcher, who will receive training in new advanced techniques in the field. This unique exchange of skills and the collaborations that will emerge in this program are expected to generate major advances in the quest for flat space holography.",299489,2024,2027,European Commission,France; United States,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Exploring Ultracold Matter along the Complexity Axis,"The science of ultracold atoms and molecules is vigorously pursued for applications to both fundamental physics, such as searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and for technology, such as quantum computing. Underlying these applications is the basic fact that the samples produced, typically still gaseous even at temperatures just above absolute zero, represent a new kind of physical substance. For example, imagine a gas, quite unlike ordinary air, where sound travels at different speeds in different directions, and where this dependence can be controlled on a whim. Though esoteric, this system has the potential to teach us new ways of looking to more familiar fluids. A second novel feature of these gases is “sticky collisions,” where molecules do not simply bounce off one another as one usually expects, but rather can become entangled in an intricate dance. These collisions are on the one hand disruptive to experiments, and must be understood in order to make progress in the field. But more fundamentally, they may have much to tell us about the relation between quantum mechanics, which holds on the scale of atoms, and classical mechanics, which describes the world we are more familiar with. This connection has puzzled physicists for over a century. Searching for novel answers to these fundamental questions will train the students involved to creatively tackle difficult, novel problems, skills which they will apply in many future endeavors. Specifically, the research will develop and solve the equations of fluid motion for an ultracold gas of polar molecules, which can be aligned in a laboratory frame by means of external electric fields. The resulting fluid equations are familiar as the Navier-Stokes equations, with the caveat that the coefficients of thermal conductivity and viscosity are anisotropic. The work will investigate novelties of this anisotropy in realistic experimental conditions. For example, one can envision stirring the fluid to excite vortical motion, then to investigate the effects of anisotropy on the transition to turbulent dynamics. In a second effort, the research will investigate collisions of atoms and molecules that possess dense, complex resonance structures. These can be approached semi-classically owing to the relatively high kinetic energy during the collision. But this approach can be complemented by a search for the most appropriate approximate quantum numbers that identify the different resonant states. In either case, one searches for the appropriate description that best represents the situation, trying to pry some degree of order from the apparent chaos. Insights gained from these highly-controlled ultracold systems will then carry over to other areas of complex systems.

"Wonderful Varieties, Hyperplane Arrangements, and Poisson Representation Theory","Geometric representation theory studies the algebraic structures formed by symmetries of geometric objects. It has connections with many areas of algebra and geometry, including algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and symplectic geometry. The present project will explore this rich interplay by developing new representation-theoretic objects in algebraic and symplectic geometry. It will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students. In more detail, the project will focus on three interrelated problems. The first project is to introduce a new class of additive analogues of spherical varieties, constructed using degenerations motivated by the theory of Poisson-Lie groups. The second is to explore matroid Schubert varieties and their connections to toric geometry. The third is to develop new connections between Poisson geometry and symplectic representation theory by studying groupoids associated to symplectic resolutions.

Beyond Mean-Field Physics in Dynamical Bose-Einstein Condensates,"Nonequilibrium phenomena, where the state of a physical system changes (as, for instance, when water freezes or boils), are found everywhere in Nature. As such, their study is important not only in physics but also in many other disciplines. With the development of quantum technologies, it has become possible to precisely engineer and measure these processes in quantum systems. Ultracold quantum gases, which consist of millions of particles cooled down to almost zero temperature, are one of the most powerful systems to study dynamical quantum effects due to their high controllability. This project aims to explore a variety of nonequilibrium processes in ultracold quantum gases. It is expected that the outcomes of the project will not only increase our understanding of these systems, but also contribute to other areas of quantum research, including quantum optics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information science. Moreover, the project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to the development of the next-generation workforce in quantum science and economy. The project will be tailored and expanded for potential REU students and local high school students. The PI will actively collaborate with students from under-represented groups, such as women and minority students. The project aims to investigate a range of beyond-mean-field physics including scattering, dynamical instabilities, critical behavior near quantum phase transitions, and quantum fluctuations near resonances in dynamical Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Focusing on the dynamics of BECs, three scenarios will be studied: (a) the dynamics of BECs with multiple momentum components; (b) the quench dynamics of synthetic spin-orbit coupled BECs across quantum phase transitions; and (c) the dynamics near spin-spatial resonances in spinor BECs. The PI and graduate students will develop theoretical frameworks and numerical tools to characterize the quantum and thermal fluctuation effects on the collision and thermalization of cold atoms, quantum phase transitions like the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and the performance of the spinor quantum simulator and sensor. The project will provide a comprehensive description of recent pertinent experimental results in the literature. The outcomes of the research project will directly stimulate potential collaboration with the in-house cold atom experimental group.

3D printing of plastic scintillator based particle detectors,"Plastic scintillator detectors are very common in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. Future HEP experiments will aim to build scintillator detectors made of several million optically-isolated scintillating voxels. The great advantage these detectors provide is the particle tracking combined with the calorimetric measurement of their energy loss. Natural applications are fine-granularity neutrino active target, sampling electromagnetic or hadronic calorimeters, astroparticle detection, fast and thermal neutron detection or cost-effective positron-emission tomography. The first example is the 3D fine-granularity plastic scintillator detector that started collecting data at the T2K neutrino oscillation experimet in Fall 2023. Future experiments will need even finer 3D granularity and, at the same time, larger instrumented volumes, making the construction of these detectors with traditional manufacturing methods, such as injection moulding or extrusion, very challenging, time consuming and, thus, expensive. Hence, a new step in the manufacturing strategy shall be developed and 3D printing is the most promising solution. Recently, we proved that additive manufacturing can be used to 3D print polystyrene-based scintillator as well as inorganic scintillator with Fused Deposition Manufacturing (FDM), by melting the material without losing its scintillation properties. Finally, in 2023 we additive manufactured the first highly-segmented plastic-scintillator detector made of several 1 cm3 optically-isolated scintillating cubes in one monolithic block, read out with wavelength-shifting fibers. Its performance is analogous to state-of-the-art detectors. We developed a novel additive manufacturing method, called Fused Injection Modeling (FIM), to achieve such milestone.Proposal: the goal of this project is to make the FIM technology ready for mass production of future scintillator-based particle detectors. The necessary steps are the design and construction of a fully-automated FIM printer with an improved optical-reflector filament, resistant at the polystyrene melting temperature. Moreover,we want to extend the additive manufacturing technology to other types of scintillator-based detectors, such as sampling calorimeters by developing a heavy absorbent material optimised for 3D printing, and neutronsensitive detectors, using a filament loaded with materials efficient in neutron capture. The consortium comprises ETH Zurich (ETHZ), the Institute for Scintillation Materials National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (ISMA) and Haute École d’Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD). The Principal Investigators (PIs) are Prof. Sgalaberna (Swiss PI), SNSF Eccellenza Assistant Professor at ETHZ, and Dr. Boyaryntsev (Ukrainian PI), ISMA Science Deputy Director. Prof. Rubbia, Full Professor at ETHZ, will participate as Project Partner and will contribute with 1 senior scientist (Dr. Kose), 1 mechanical engineer (Mr. Weber) plus additional independent funding. Prof. Hugon (HEIG-VD) will also be Project Partner and will support the project as advisor thanks to his expertise in additive manufacturing.ETHZ, ISMA and HEIG-VD are part of the “3D printed DETectors” (3DET) international R&D collaboration, hosted by CERN, with Prof. Sgalaberna as spokeperson and Dr. Kose as technical coordinator. They have complementary roles in this R&D, with ISMA developing the scintillator optimised for 3D printing and ETHZ and HEIG-VD implementing the novel additive manufacturing method and testing the detector performance. This SNSF joint research programme will ensure the continuation of such productive Swiss-Ukrainian collaboration by mainly funding the salary of researchers for a 2-year period.",297888,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Manufacturing Engineering; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Advances in Nonlinear Waves and Solitons in Integrable and Non-Integrable Systems,"This project offers an in-depth investigation of the mathematical properties and physical applications of a special class of nonlinear waves. Over the past 50 years, a large body of knowledge has been accumulated on the nonlinear wave equations known as “integrable systems”, which are used to model a wide variety of physically interesting phenomena, ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to low temperature physics and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Several integrable systems are studied as part of the project: scalar and multicomponent nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) type equations, Maxwell-Bloch equations describing the interaction of light with an active optical medium, discrete integrable and non-integral lattices such as the Ablowitz-Ladik equations, the discrete NLS, the Salerno model, etc. The project has concrete applications in nonlinear optics and BEC, and the investigator also collaborates with physicists to seek experimental validation of the results of obtained by the principal investigator (PI). It is therefore anticipated that the outcomes of the project will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers more broadly, thus potentially benefiting the society at large. As part of the project, the investigator is involved in the organization of several conferences and special sessions at larger professional meetings in the US and abroad, e.g., a 4 week-long program on “Emergent Phenomena in Nonlinear Dispersive Waves”, to be held at Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK, in July-August 2024. Notably, the investigator organizes an event to showcase the research of female scientists. The training of graduate students is an integral component of the project, and two graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow are expected to work with the PI on research problems arising from this project. This project is aimed at advancing our theoretical and practical understanding of physically relevant integrable systems, as well as non-integrable systems in regimes that are not too far from the integrable ones, and it collects a suite of problems combined into a cohesive and coherent research effort, whose results will fundamentally further our knowledge of nonlinear waves and solitons, and their applications in various settings. Specifically, the investigator and her team pursue the following objectives: (i) formulation of a rigorous perturbation theory for dark and dark-bright solitons; (ii) development of a numerical inverse scattering transform on a nontrivial background; (iii) study of rogue waves, solitons and soliton interactions in scalar and coupled integrable and nonintegrable equations; (iv) investigation of the effect of radiation on the norming constants associated with the defocusing NLS equation, and their renormalization for solitonic models of condensates; (v) concrete applications to specific problems in BEC and nonlinear optics; (vi) study of Maxwell-Bloch systems both with rapidly decaying optical pulses and pulses with a constant background, and long-time asymptotics of their solutions. The project is carried out by developing and using a combination of: (a) exact methods, such as the inverse scattering transform, Backlund and Darboux transformations, and other direct methods; (b) asymptotic techniques, multiple scales and other perturbative tools; (c) state-of-the-art numerical simulations; (d) comparison with experiments in BEC and nonlinear optics.

"Cluster Algebras, Combinatorics and Knot Theory","The theory of cluster algebras is a highly active research area in mathematics that was initiated in 2002. The original motivation came from representation theory, a branch of modern algebra which is concerned with studying the symmetries of an algebraic structure rather than studying the structure itself. Representation theory has numerous applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other mathematical fields. Cluster algebras capture fundamental underlying combinatorial patterns that occur throughout representation theory. Quite remarkably, these patterns turn out to be present as well in a number of other branches of mathematics and physics that had previously seemed mostly unrelated. This project will contribute to the development of cluster algebras and their relations to other areas, in particular to knot theory and representations of algebras. The project will involve graduate students in the proposed research. The project has several objectives. The principal investigator will develop a fundamental connection between cluster algebras and knot theory that realizes important knot invariants as specializations of cluster variables. The centerpiece of this project is the construction of a cluster algebra from an arbitrary knot or link, such that the cluster algebra contains a cluster in which each cluster variable specializes to the Alexander polynomial of the knot. The second objective is to study Cohen-Macaulay modules over 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebras. These are non-commutative algebras that are associated to the clusters of a cluster algebra via categorification. One overarching goal is the classification of 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebras that admit only finitely many Cohen-Macaulay modules. A third aim is to study maximal almost rigid modules, a new concept in representation theory inspired by the PI’s previous work on Catalan combinatorics. In this project, he PI will show that the triangulations of a surface with marked points and dissection correspond bijectively to the maximal almost rigid modules over an algebra associated to the surface dissection.

Geometry of Moduli Spaces and Metaplectic Representations,"Conformal field theories, rooted in theoretical physics, offer a powerful framework for geometers to study algebraic curves. While traditionally focused on curves, recent advancements in the geometric manifestations of infinite-dimensional algebras suggest the emergence of a rich theory applicable to higher-dimensional varieties as well. Motivated by promising preliminary findings, the PI will lead an exploration of conformal field theories extending beyond curves, probing fundamental questions concerning the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties. Similarly, the PI will investigate invariants for knots and 3-manifolds. This project will fuel the integration of ideas from several fields of mathematics, such as representation theory, algebraic geometry, and quantum topology. It will also feature experiential learning initiatives tailored for middle school students, alongside research training opportunities designed for undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, the project aims to foster interdisciplinary collaborations and enhance mathematical literacy within the general public through a series of public lectures and events. More specifically, the PI will build upon recent work on coinvariants of vertex algebras to explore geometric realizations of metaplectic modules on abelian varieties and their moduli spaces. These investigations will offer a novel perspective on the theory of theta functions and vector bundles equipped with a projectively flat connection on families of abelian varieties. Furthermore, the PI will investigate the factorization properties of spaces of coinvariants on decomposable abelian varieties, followed by an assessment of the persistence of these properties at boundary points across various compactifications. Finally, the PI will explore various refinements of the theory of homological blocks for knots and 3-manifolds.

Rethinking AdS/CFT Integrability,"Integrable models are of central importance in theoretical physics due to their distinct mathematical structures, allowing for exact solutions of observables at any coupling strength. This SPF project aims to uncover new analytical insights into quantum gauge and gravity theories with reduced Noether symmetries through the lens of integrability. Although integrable models have had notable success in specific scenarios, such as planar Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, their mechanisms and properties in less symmetric systems remain largely unexplored.The primary objective of this project is to extend the scope of the holographic AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a string-theoretic realisation of a holographic duality that exchanges gravity with gauge theories. This will be achieved by developing specific and universal methods to modify the boundary conditions of integrable models. The emphasis is on open boundary conditions, where the open string interacts with non-perturbative objects, and on integrable deformations of worldsheet models, which can be viewed as a continuous twist of these boundary conditions.By exploring integrable models and their deformations, we will develop new methods for dealing with strongly-coupled quantum field theories, an area that requires fundamental new ideas in mathematical physics to make progress. This advancement is crucial for theoretical physics and the training of young researchers. In the long term, the knowledge gained from this project could pave the way for new technologies and applications based on an improved understanding of fundamental physical principles.",292146,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Collaborative Research: The Condor Array Telescope Survey of the Northern Sky,"The Condor Array Telescope has been operating in southwest New Mexico since 2021. This observatory combines six off-the-shelf refracting telescopes with six off-the-shelf CMOS cameras and is optimized for very high sensitivity, very rapid time resolution, and a very wide field of view. Continued operations of this telescope in a collaboration between the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the American Museum of Natural History will focus on three specific science topics: imaging the “cosmic web” of intergalactic gas, searching for shells from ancient stellar novae, and making deep images of our nearest galactic neighbors. Under this award, the collaboration will replace the current cameras, which will increase the field of view of the array by 70%. A portion of the observing time on Condor will be allocated to provide astronomical telescope access to under-represented students at Stony Brook University, and the telescope will provide faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students at the respective institutions with access to a world-class astronomical observing facility with unique observational capabilities. The research team will use Condor to obtain, analyze, and interpret a variety of observations of the Northern Hemisphere sky, focusing on several important science topics: (1) Condor will image huge portions of the extremely faint and distant filaments of the “cosmic web” of intergalactic gas that stretches between the galaxies, seeking to determine its structure on very large spatial scales. (2) The team will explore extended regions surrounding 25 cataclysmic variable stars of a variety of different types, searching for ancient nova shells that may provide clues as to how the types are related to one another. (3) Condor will monitor wide regions of the sky toward two nearby groups of galaxies minute by minute and night by night, gradually building up deep images of our nearest galaxy neighbors while searching for flaring novae and other evidence of stars that have been expelled from the galaxies and are now floating freely in intergalactic space. These same observations are also likely to find Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zones of white dwarf stars and tenuous dusty clouds of interstellar gas that obscure our view of the distant Universe.

Approximation properties in von Neumann algebras,"Von Neumann algebras were introduced in the 1930's and 40's to study representation theory of groups, and to use as a tool for developing a mathematical foundation for quantum physics. They have since developed into a full area of study as a natural noncommutative notion of measure theory. The noncommutative setting of topology (C*-algebras) emerged shortly after, and the two subjects have historically been closely connected. This project explores these connections to develop new ideas, to reach a broad mathematical community and providing engagement and support for new students in the field. The investigator is actively participating in the training of students and postdocs in von Neumann algebras and the research from this project will directly impact these students and postdocs. The project investigator is studying approximation properties (or the lack thereof) in von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, especially relating to group von Neumann algebras and group measure space constructions. This has historically been a significant area of study in the classification of operator algebras, with amenability/injectivity playing a major role in the development of von Neumann algebras, and nuclearity playing a major corresponding role in the theory of C*-algebras. The emergence of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to numerous breakthroughs in the classification of von Neumann algebras beyond the amenability setting, and approximation properties, such as Ozawa's notion of a biexact group, have created new opportunities to study approximation properties in the setting of von Neumann algebras. The research developed in this project investigates these approximation properties, creating new connections between C* and von Neumann algebras. This allows new C*-algebraic tools to be used in the setting of von Neumann algebras, leading to new structural results for group and group measure space von Neumann algebras, and giving a deeper insight into interactions between operator algebras, ergodic theory, and geometric group theory.

Cyclic Cohomology of Toeplitz Operators and Proper Group Actions,"This award supports a research project in noncommutative geometry and its applications. Noncommutative geometry is a mathematical field in which spaces are studied through an algebraic lens, in a way analogous to the relationship between a topological space and the algebra of continuous, complex-valued functions on that space. An important feature of the algebraic structures in noncommutative geometry is that – unlike multiplication of functions – their multiplication is not commutative, that is, the order in which elements are multiplied changes the outcome. This property makes for a mathematically rich generalization of classical geometry and enables connections between noncommutative geometry and many other fields, including representation theory, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, as well as the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. This project will explore the noncommutative geometry of two systems of non-commuting operators, one arising from the theory of Toeplitz operators, and the other from group symmetries. The PI’s primary aim is to introduce new numerical invariants to distinguish noncommutative spaces, and refine known invariants such as the Connes-Chern character. The project will also provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars and support the PI’s outreach efforts to middle school and high school students in the community. Cyclic theory, the noncommutative analogue of de Rham theory in differential geometry, will be applied in this project to study an analytic version of the Milnor fibration, a novel concept arising in the investigation of the Arveson-Douglas conjecture. A new method for analyzing variations of traces and cyclic cocycles on the fibration will be developed, building an analytic approach to secondary invariants. Additionally, a geometric model for the cyclic cohomology of a Lie group will be constructed to study invariants for proper cocompact actions. This model will facilitate the exploration of new homotopy invariants associated with diffeomorphism groups.

Certification and cryptography in quantum networks,"This project has the goal of creating the first quantum cryptographic protocols tailored for quantum networks. The multipartite quantum cryptographic protocols that already exist rely on assumptions that do not match the reality of the implementations that we expect in the future, namely that the parties are arranged forming a network where quantum systems are distributed only among subsets of the parties. Inserting the network structure is known to lower the experimental requirements for certifying the presence of non-classical phenomena, and now it is the time to exploit these advantages in practice. Yet, in order to fully exploit quantum networks for cryptography, new fundamental understanding of their components must be developed. This project is divided in three work packages, that cover this development of fundamental notions, building new tools to guarantee the presence of quantum phenomena in networks, and the development of new cryptographic protocols.The first part of the project will be devoted to the study of the building blocks of quantum networks. These are the quantum states that are distributed, the network structure according to which they are distributed, and the measurements that are performed on them. While much is known about which quantum states are useful for quantum cryptography, much less is known of the other two. This project will build an understanding of the role of entangled measurements for establishing quantum correlations in networks, and create tools for obtaining guarantees of, both, the presence of entangled measurements in a network and of the network structure itself. The studies will be developed within the formalism of device-independent quantum information, which allows to work with untrusted devices.The second work package concerns certification of non-classical phenomena in networks considering them as a whole, in contrast to a collection of building blocks. This becomes a crucial matter, because the traditional notions of non-classicality only detect that some process in some part of the network is non-classical, but fail to capture complete quantum behavior. This project will find witnesses of strong forms of non-classicality, with a focus in loop and chain networks. The choice of these networks is motivated by the fact that they underlie the quantum repeaters that are used in practice to distribute quantum states over long distances. At this point it is when one can look for realizations where certifying non-classicality is easier, in terms of experimentally relevant requirements, than with the traditional assumptions. In this regard this project will look for examples of activation phenomena, namely, examples of quantum systems and measurements over them whose statistics can be simulated using classical systems, but such that using multiple copies arranged in a quantum network lead to results that cannot be reproduced by measurements on classical systems. At this point, a search to use the tools developed in certifying non-classicality and network structure in real experiments will be conducted as well.Armed with the tools and concepts developed in the previous work packages, the final part of the project will be devoted to the end goal of creating network-based quantum cryptographic protocols. Being the most ambitious work package and also the one with the highest potential impact, it will take a gradual approach. First the question of how to insert the realistic assumption of an underlying network structure affects the proofs of security of established quantum cryptographic protocols, and which new vectors of attack appear, will be analyzed. This will be the trampoline to develop a full-fledged framework to study cryptographic protocols in networks, that will lead to the first proposal of network-based quantum cryptographic protocols and associated security proofs.As a whole, the body of work to be developed in this research project will lead to a solid understanding of quantum correlations in networks, advances in the fundamental understanding of quantum measurements, and practical tools to analyze real-world protocols.

In search of the electron-phonon gems,"Background and rationale: The impact of atomic vibrations on the electronic properties of crystalline materials is called electron-phonon coupling and is ubiquitous in materials science and device engineering. Importantly, many emerging physical phenomena can only be explained by accounting for electron-phonon interactions explicitly. These properties range from phonon-driven superconductivity and kinks in angle-resolved photoemission spectral to carrier mobilities, polaron formation, and spin dynamics. Unfortunately, these properties are often complex, time consuming, and expensive to measure experimentally. In this context, ab-initio calculations offer an ideal tool to predict, scale, and automate the study of physical properties driven by electron-phonon interactions. We aim to study these electron-phonon interactions in experimentally known, crystalline and stoichiometric materials. This ambitious goal can only be achieved if all the needed building blocks are firmly in place. First, one needs a robust framework and platform for automatically managing calculations while making them reproducible, retrievable and available online. In addition, the calculation of electron-phonon driven properties is numerically challenging, and efficient and accurate interpolation methods are required; this is now possible thanks to the development of novel methods and hampered by several practical issues that we have recently solved. The time is thus ripe for an high-throughput search for novel materials with breakthrough properties, accompanied by the release of an open source and publicly available electron-phonon database. To achieve this, we will leverage the expertise of Prof. Marzari in automation and databases with the one of Prof. Poncé in first-principles electron-phonon simulations thanks to this joint international SNSF-FNRS WEAVE project. Overall objectives and specific aims: The two main objectives are (i) searching for novel ductile ambient-pressure phonon-driven superconductor with high critical temperature (above liquid hydrogen - 20.28 K); and (ii) searching for novel ultra-high mobility semiconductors. In the process, we will create an electron-phonon database for many known inorganic bulk materials as well as easily exfoliable 2D monolayers and 1D chains.Methods to be used: The core tool will be first-principles calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory, with results interpolated on ultra-dense momentum grids using Wannier functions.  Thanks to recent developments in our groups, the quality of this interpolation has been dramatically increased in bulk and 2D materials. Based on these calculations, we will compute the phonon-limited superconductivity using the isotropic Allen-Dynes and anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. Finally, for the drift and Hall carrier mobility calculations, we will employ the ab-initio Boltzmann transport equation which is accurately predictive for resistive transport. Expected results and their impact: Finding a new ambient pressure phonon-limited superconductors would be revolutionary - especially if the material is also ductile and can break the liquid hydrogen barrier of 20.28 K as He is becoming ever scarcer and more expansive.  For context, there are about 10,000 superconducting electromagnets in the Large Hadron Collider working at an operating temperature of 1.9~K, which requires 96 tonnes of superfluid helium-4. Similarly, the finding of novel high-mobility materials will have far reaching implications in the field of solar cells, new generation transistors, or power transformers.",289054,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Belgium,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Algebraic Structures in String Topology,"The goal of this project is to understand the general structure of string interactions in a background space, its significance in geometry and mathematical physics, and to carry out explicit computations using algebraic models. Interactions of strings, paths, and loops are ubiquitous throughout mathematics and science. These range from observable phenomena in fluid dynamics (vortex rings in a fluid coming together to become a new ring or self-intersecting and breaking apart into multiple rings) to patterns arising in areas of theoretical physics such as string theory and quantum field theory. String topology proposes a mathematical model to study these interactions in terms of operations defined by intersecting, reconnecting, and cutting strings (closed curves) evolving in time in a manifold. Giving a rigorous and complete description of the structure of string topology, which is one of the aims of the proposed project, will also provide solid foundations for physical theories. Furthermore, the physicially inspired theory of string topology turns out to inform theoretical questions in mathematics: probing a space through strings and studying how all possible interactions are organized also reveals intricate aspects of the background geometry. Building upon previous work of the PI, the project proposes to algebraicize string topology through tractable models obtained by decomposing, or discretizing, the underlying space into cells and using techniques from algebraic topology and homological algebra, two well developed active fields of pure mathematics. These models will be applicable to study a wide range of string interaction phenomena appearing in both pure and applied mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The proposed project includes a broad educational component focused on fostering mathematical activity and access at multiple levels. This involves graduate student training, organization of summer workshops and conferences that bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, and the support of periodic seminars at the PI’s institution. In more technical detail, this project aims to study chain-level string topology with a focus on operations that are sensitive to geometric structure beyond the homotopy type of the underlying manifold. In particular, the PI proposes to construct a homotopy coherent structure lifting the Goresky-Hingston loop coalgebra (and its S^1-symmetric Lie cobracket version) originally defined on the homology of the space of free loops on a manifold relative to the constant loops. The construction of such structure will use an appropriate refinement of Poincaré duality and intersection theory at the level of chains on a finely triangulated manifold together with the theory of algebraic models for loop spaces of non-simply connected manifolds developed in previous work of the PI using techniques from Hochschild homology theory and Koszul duality theory. These models will be transparent enough to reveal the precise geometric ingredients that are necessary to construct a coherent hierarchy of higher structures for string topology. This hierarchy of chain-level operations will provide a rich source of computable and potentially new manifold invariants. Connections with symplectic geometry, homological mirror symmetry, and the theory of quantization will be explored.

Cavity solitons in time-multiplexed resonators,"A temporal Kerr cavity soliton (CS) is an optical pulse that propagates undistributed in a low-loss passive resonator. As part of its energy periodically escapes the resonator at each roundtrip, it forms a pulse train. Owing to their ultra-high stability compared to the pulses generated by mode-locked lasers, CSs are expected to play a crucial role in the future of atomic clocks, frequency combs, and high-precision metrology. Besides their inherent stability, they exhibit particle-like behavior. In particular, a couple of CSs can interact in the resonator and eventually form a bound state. Depending on the interaction, such coupled states can be more robust than the single-CS state itself. The aim of SITES (Solitons in time-multiplexed resonators) is to study, theoretically and experimentally, how temporal couplings within an optical resonator lead to the emergence of dynamic behaviors and cavity solitons that do not occur otherwise. On the applied side, SITES can give rise to a new kind of ultra-stable pulse train. On the fundamental front, SITES aims to investigate how these couplings between CSs can be leveraged for computational purposes and used to simulate specific crystal lattices. Such synthetic lattice combined with particle-like CSs leads to a fertile ground for the investigation of nonlinear effects in bosonic systems. Despite these strong fundamental and applied reasons, versatile couplings between multiple CSs have not been experimentally explored so far, mainly because the significant losses arising from the couplings prohibit reaching the intriguing nonlinear regimes. The experimental approach of SITES will overcome such a challenge and enables the realization of previously inaccessible coupled CSs.",288673,2024,2027,European Commission,Belgium; United States,EU,Classical Physics; Quantum Physics
Characterization and Control of Rydberg Exciton Polariton Scattering,"This research project aims to advance quantum technology by exploring the potential of Rydberg excitons—unique, large artificial atoms within semiconductors that exhibit strong interactions with light. These Rydberg excitons could lead to significant advances in quantum computing and secure communications by enabling new ways to manipulate and entangle light particles. The primary activity involves developing new theoretical models to understand and control how Rydberg excitons interact with their surroundings, particularly with crystal impurities. This work will not only deepen our knowledge of these interactions but also guide future experiments and technological applications. Additionally, the project will contribute to the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in cutting-edge quantum mechanics and semiconductor physics, fostering the next generation of scientists in this exciting field. Furthermore, the project includes outreach activities such as developing an educational computer game to help students and the public learn about quantum phenomena in a fun and engaging way. This project addresses a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of Rydberg exciton polaritons, which are promising candidates for scalable quantum systems due to their strong light-matter interactions and controllable exciton-exciton interactions. The research will develop a coupled-channel scattering theory to elucidate the interactions between Rydberg excitons and crystal impurities, quantify polariton-polariton interaction strengths, and calculate polariton scattering in structured photonic environments. These theoretical advancements will provide a comprehensive framework to interpret experimental results and explore the potential of Rydberg exciton polaritons in optical quantum technologies. By establishing scattering theory as the appropriate method for these systems, the project will address significant loss mechanisms due to charged defects in high-purity semiconductors and reveal the long-range nature of Rydberg polariton interactions. The findings will also demonstrate how photonic band engineering can control these interactions, advancing the field of quantum optics and the development of solid-state quantum information processing platforms.

Positive Geometries in the Real World,"""Our understanding of the fundamental laws of Nature is based on the study of scattering amplitudes, traditionally computed using Feynman diagrams.
In the past three decades, the shortcomings of this representation have become increasingly clear. Scattering amplitudes enjoy a simplicity which is destroyed by Feynman diagrams, resulting in an overwhelming apparent complexity of computations.
This has motivated the search for alternatives to Feynman diagrams, which culminated in the discovery that scattering amplitudes in two toy theories, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and the simplest theory describing colored scalars, can be computed as """"Volumes"""" of positive geometries: regions in kinematic space carved out by inequalities.
In the new representation it is the usual properties kept manifest by Feynman diagrams, Locality and Unitarity, which are now obscured while the simplicity of scattering amplitudes is restored.
These developments are both conceptually intriguing and practically useful; however, they have so far been limited to applications in toy theories only.
The goal of PositiveWorld (Positive geometries in the real World) is to address this issue, using the lessons learned in these examples to describe our world, thus marching towards a reformulation of physics completely alternative to the traditional language of Quantum Field Theory and Feynman diagrams.
The guiding principle in this exploration is that progress is measured by the efficiency of computations. Therefore, concrete results within PositiveWorld are presented in the form of novel algorithms to address calculations on various topics of scattering theory, with practical applications for theoretical predictions of experiments taking place at particle colliders.""",287555,2024,2027,European Commission,Germany; United States,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
UltrafasT flOquet PolaritonIcs metAsurfaces,"Electromagnetic waves interacting with materials give rise to polaritons, hybrid excitations of light and matter. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) in polar crystals stand out for their low loss and anisotropic behavior. Concurrently, Floquet theory has gained prominence in nanophotonics, enabling the engineering of topological properties in periodically driven systems. The UTOPIA project aims to merge these domains, establishing ultrafast Floquet polaritonics as a cutting-edge field. It seeks to demonstrate this concept in natural van der Waals materials and synthetic metasurfaces. Polariton research has evolved from plasmon polaritons to encompass phonons, excitons, and Cooper pairs. Phonon polaritons, with their anisotropic response, have opened avenues for nanophotonics. Recent discoveries in two-dimensional van der Waals materials like hexagonal boron nitride have unveiled hyperbolic polaritons in natural crystals. UTOPIA bridges phonon polaritons and Floquet theory, aiming to pioneer tailored light-matter interactions. Floquet systems endow physical systems with synthetic dimensions via periodic potentials, enabling nonreciprocal systems, topological phases, and 4+ dimensional physics. While Floquet quasi-energy states have been demonstrated in graphene, the field of Floquet polaritonics remains underexplored, lacking a demonstration of temporally driven changes in phonon polariton dispersion.UTOPIA's objectives include: 1) Demonstrating Floquet-driven topological polaritonic transitions via grating coupling in natural materials, mapping near-field observables to the far-field and enabling dynamical phase transitions. 2) Designing metasurfaces supporting synthetic hyperbolic polaritons, expanding Floquet polaritonics to optical frequencies and various temporal modulations.3) Achieving infrared light amplification via polariton-assisted anisotropic parametric amplification, harnessing polaritonic excitations for efficient amplification.",286959,2024,2027,European Commission,Italy; United States,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Nanoscale Electromagnetic Control of Advanced Lubricants,"Friction has a crucial role in almost any technological applications accounting for more than 25% of the world's energy consumption. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been suggested as the next generation of lubricants. Applications of ILs in real-life scenarios rely on full control of their properties in often inaccessible nanogaps. Externally applied electric or magnetic fields have emerged as a strong candidate to change surface polarisation of sliding solids and manipulate ILs lubricating properties in such tight gaps. However, an exhaustive picture of the molecular processes behind electromagnetic control of friction in systems lubricated by ILs is still lacking. NanoECoAL aims at investigating the influence of nanoscale electric and magnetic domains on the organization and shear response of model IL lubricants relevant for any mechanical systems. NanoECoAL will use atomic force microscopy to image, with sub-nanometric resolution, structural organization of ILs molecules as a function of surface electric and magnetic polarization; and at the same time studying their dynamic behaviour, in terms of lubricated friction force. Nanoscale in situ investigations will be complemented by macroscale tribology to bridge the gap between atomistic models and macroscale observations. NanoECoAL’s broader impact will support rational design of new and improved ILs that can reduce energy consumption in advanced tribological applications. Furthermore, the project will imply highly innovative, direct methodological developments that can be broadly applied, thus enhancing European academic and commercial competitiveness. The project has a strong multidisciplinary character and will greatly benefit from the expertise the fellow acquired from his mobility and collaborations with research institutions in different countries.

Investigating the Chemical and Dynamical Complexity of Titan's Upper Atmosphere,"Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is considered a possible analogue for studying the processes occurring on primitive, Earth-like planets. Titan has a thick atmosphere, rich in carbon, nitrogen and organic compounds. The unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) enables the entire Earth-facing hemisphere of Titan to be mapped in only minutes. This research team will elucidate Titan’s high-altitude atmospheric physics and chemistry, to improve our understanding of the key processes responsible for shaping the atmospheres of slowly rotating Earth-like planets throughout the Galaxy. They will promote the uptake of science careers by under-represented minorities via the intern Program for Underrepresented Minorities in Astrophysics (iPUMA). Undergraduates will be recruited to participate in a paid 10-week internship where they will conduct independent research by participating in imaging and analysis of ALMA data on solar system bodies. The recent discovery of a strongly time-variable thermospheric jet presents a major challenge for theories regarding Titan’s high-altitude atmospheric physics. This project will use ALMA archival data to produce accurate zonal wind fields for Titan's middle/upper atmosphere (in the altitude range 200-1000 km), as a function of latitude and time between 2012-2016. By focusing on species that emit at high-altitudes (HC3N, HCN and HNC), the project focuses on the little-studied region between 500–1000 km that was inaccessible to Cassini CIRS limb-sounding studies. By comparing the observations to output from state-of-the-art general circulation models, the project will investigate the origin of Titan's mysterious thermospheric jet and study the importance of atmospheric waves in the horizontal and vertical transport of angular momentum. By exploiting the wealth of available ALMA archival data, the team will perform an exhaustive, deep search for new, complex organic molecules on Titan, to help elucidate the steps towards biologically relevant compounds in primitive, C and N-rich (exo-) planetary atmospheres.

Precision spectroscopy of single hydrogen molecular ions,"Precision tests of fundamental physics require systems that are simple enough for a precise theoretical description and whose properties can be accurately measured. Recent theory advances have paved the way for testing fundamental physics using the hydrogen molecular ion H2+ whose energy levels can now be calculated with relative uncertainties on the few-ppt level. However, spectroscopy of H2+ is notoriously difficult, and few precision measurements have been reported so far. Since the H2+ molecule is symmetric, dipole transitions between rovibrational states are forbidden. Standard experimental techniques that rely on state decay, such as optical pumping, laser cooling, and fluorescence detection, are therefore not practical.We have now succeeded in holding single H2+ ions in a Paul trap for many hours, preparing them in a single hyperfine sublevel of the rovibrational ground state, and reading out the molecular state using quantum-logic techniques. Based on these results, we plan a series of spectroscopy experiments on the H2+ ions.The first is precision spectroscopy of the hyperfine structure of the (? = 0, L = 1) ground state of Ortho-H2+. The hyperfine structure of excited rovibrational states (? = 4-8, L = 1) was measured more than 50 years ago with an estimated uncertainty of 1.5 kHz. Theoretical calculations have only recently achieved agreement with these measurements at the level of the experimental uncertainty. Based on our experience with hyperfine spectroscopy of other ions, I expect that we can improve the previous measurement by more than an order of magnitude.The second is precision spectroscopy of the (? = 0, L = 0) -> (? = 3, L = 2) electric quadrupole transition at a wavelength of 1576 nm. We plan to achieve a relative measurement uncertainty of less than one ppt which is below the current theory uncertainty.The third is spectroscopy of the pure rotational transition (? = 0, L = 0) -> (? = 0, L = 2) at 5.2 THz which can be driven as a Raman transition using a pair of lasers whose relative detuning matches this frequency.The proposed experiments rely on quantum logic spectroscopy. In this technique the “spectroscopy ion” (in our case H2+) is trapped together with a “logic ion” (in our case Be+) that has suitable transitions for laser cooling, optical pumping, and state readout. Due to the mutual Coulomb interaction between the ions, their motion is strongly coupled. The internal state of the spectroscopy ion can then be transferred to the internal state of the logic ion using appropriate laser pulses that couple the internal states of the ions to the motion. The technique is used both for state readout and for state preparation of the spectroscopy ion.Each of the three proposed spectroscopy experiments will significantly advance the state of the art in the field.The measurement of the ground-state hyperfine structure of Ortho-H2+ will provide a test of the hyperfine structure theory of molecular hydrogen ions which was recently improved. This is particularly interesting for the molecular spectroscopy community since there is a yet-unresolved discrepancy of nine combined standard deviations between experiment and theory in the hyperfine structure of HD+ which is described by the same underlying theory.The calculated rovibrational energy levels of H2+ depend on several fundamental constants. The most import ones are the proton-to-electron mass ratio, the Rydberg constant, and the proton charge radius. By comparing different experimental results to theory, these fundamental constants can be determined. The Rydberg constant and proton charge radius have already been measured using spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and muonic hydrogen, and the resulting uncertainty of the calculated rovibrational energy levels of H2+ is below the theory uncertainty. The measurement of the (? = 0, L = 0) -> (? = 3, L = 2) transition frequency in H2+ will therefore allow us to perform one of the most accurate determinations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. This result can then be compared other precise measurements, for example based on cyclotron frequency measurements in Penning traps. The agreement or disagreement between the results then gives a stringent test of the underlying theory.A measurement of the (? = 0, L = 0) -> (? = 0, L = 2) rotational transition will add another data point to this comparison. In principle, this would be sufficient to determine not only the proton-to-electron mass ratio, but also the Rydberg constant and the proton charge radius. However, currently the theory uncertainty of the rovibrational levels of H2+ is around one order of magnitude too large to make this comparison. Our measurement will therefore give a strong impetus for theorists in the field to improve the calculations.",286012,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators"
Hyperbolic geometry in dimensions 2 and 3,"Two and three-dimensional spaces are fundamental objects lying at the intersection of many branches of mathematics. One approach to studying these spaces is to endow them with geometric structure and then use the geometry to study the spaces. The three most familiar geometries are the classical Euclidean or flat geometry, and the two non-Euclidean geometries: spherical and hyperbolic. It has been known since the late 1800s that most two-dimensional spaces (or surfaces) exhibit hyperbolic geometry. Thurston's groundbreaking work in the 1970s showed that ""most"" three dimensional spaces (or three-manifolds) also have hyperbolic geometry. The rich landscape of hyperbolic manifolds in two and three dimensions motivates this project's focus on hyperbolic geometry. The project will include many sub-projects suitable for training graduate students to work in this area. The PI, together with graduate students, will study questions around the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One central topic will be the ""renormalized volume"" of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, and the connection between the Weil-Petersson gradient flow and the volume of the convex core. While renormalized volume has strong connections to physics, in this project the focus will be mathematical. The PI will study a version of renormalized volume of the universal Teichmüller space, and Thurston's skinning map. In another series of projects, the PI will study a family of curve complexes that interpolates between the usual curve graph and a quasi-tree, and will investigate the existence of actions of the mapping class group on median spaces and CAT(0) cube complexes.

Cosmology and Particle Physics at the Intersection of Theory and Experiment,"This award funds the research of Professor Luis Anchordoqui at CUNY Lehman College. High energy physics is in a state of flux. Data from underground particle colliders, from astrophysics, and from cosmology are together allowing physicists to determine with unprecedented accuracy the values of the many parameters that describe our universe. The values of these parameters are turning out to be the keys to unlocking fundamental secrets concerning the evolution of the universe. One of the most prominent parameters describing the universe is the so-called Hubble constant H0, which quantifies how rapidly the universe is expanding today. Unfortunately, recent improved measurements of this quantity have led to a mystery, with the apparent value of H0 depending on how it is measured. Physicists using the Planck satellite to study the light from the ""early"" universe (only about 380,000 years after the big bang) reported that H0 should be about 67 (shorthand for the universe is expanding some 67 kilometers per second faster every 3.26 million light-years), while physicists analyzing astronomical observations from stars and galaxies in the ""late"" universe peg H0 at about 73. The discrepancy between these two values of H0 is called the ""Hubble constant tension"". The resolution of this conundrum will likely require a coordinated effort involving theory, interpretation, data analysis, and observation. In this dynamic environment, Professor Anchordoqui will study methods that can help address the H0 tension while at the same time providing solid predictions for data from underground colliders. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science. Professor Anchordoqui will also involve students in his research, thereby helping to train the next generation of scientists. More technically, Professor Anchordoqui will pursue a number of different approaches to addressing the Hubble constant tension. These include theoretical modeling of a transition from an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to a de Sitter (dS) space in the late universe, which has recently been proposed as an empirical solution of the H0 tension. The theoretical modelling is rooted on quantum effects derived from the Casimir energy of a scalar and fermions propagating into one extra (""dark"") dimension of a size in the micron range. In particular, Anchordoqui will study the problem of false vacuum decay in the presence of gravity and one compact dimension, and compute the transition probability of the scalar field (which triggers the AdS-dS transition), generalizing the reults of Coleman and de Luccia. In addition, he will investigate aspects of primordial black holes within the dark dimension scenario. Anchordoqui will also carry out statistical analyses using Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods to constrain cosmological parameters which arise in minimal extensions of the empirical AdS-dS transition model, as well as in explicit stringy realizations of the Dynamical Dark Matter framework. Professor Anchordoqui is also involved with the Pierre Auger Collaboration, searching for the origin and nature of the highest-energy cosmic rays and studying particle interactions at center-of-mass energies well beyond those attained at the LHC.

"Holomorphic Floer Theory, Exponential Integrals and Resurgence","It is common in mathematics and physics to describe quantities as infinite series with respect to small parameters. On the other hand, these series can have global meanings in the regions where the parameters are not small. This phenomenon often appears in physics under the name of ""duality"". The PI will develop a theory encompassing a large class of examples associated with so-called exponential integrals whose associated global information gives rise to unexpected geometric structures. The results will reveal novel relations between the theory of exponential integrals and quantum physics. The PI will also integrate this research with educational efforts, developing new directions and projects for young researchers. Exponential integrals give a simple but deep special case of Holomorphic Floer Theory. The project will study exponential integrals with an emphasis on Hodge-theoretical aspects and their relation to the generalized Riemann-Hilbert correspondence introduced by the PI and Kontsevich. The PI will develop the de Rham and Betti cohomology theories associated with exponential integrals, including comparison isomorphisms. This is done in the framework of complex manifolds endowed with holomorphic functions or with closed one-forms. Some outcomes of the research will be a Holomorphic Morse-Novikov theory. Developing the notion of wall-crossing structures the PI will give a conceptual explanation of resurgent properties of perturbative expansions of exponential integrals in finite and infinite dimensions.

Toward and Beyond a Quantum-Limited Scanning Force Sensor,"Building a scanning force sensor capable of imaging single-molecules, by detecting their nuclear magnetic field, would revolutionize structural biology and material sciences. This would not only help understand the structure of molecules, proteins or viruses and aid the design of new medications, but would also allow unprecedented insights of nano-structures and help develop new nano-structures or understand surface defects which currently limit performance of some nano-fabricated devices (e.g. surface charges in superconducting qubit). In this project, we propose to build such a microscope, using nano magnetic resonance imaging (nano-MRI). To circumvent technical challenges typically faced in the nano-MRI community, due to 'floppy' mechanical sensors, we will use high mechanical frequency (i.e. stiff) membranes, developed in the optomechanics community, to show their potential as scanning force sensors.  Owing to their incredible force sensing properties, these membranes can be limited by the quantum noise of the laser “kicking” them. The goal of this project is to first show that our scanning force sensor is quantum-limited (i.e., limited by the quantum noise of the laser driving mechanical motion), a first for scanning force sensors. Second, we want to go beyond this quantum limit using known techniques from optomechanics, such as using squeezed states of light. Going beyond this quantum limit is a necessary step to sense single nuclear spin. As force sensors improve, they will no longer be limited by their mechanical properties (thermal noise), but rather by the probing light properties (quantum noise). Our platform should allow us to lead the way for the next generation of scanning force sensors and would be a stepping stone toward the ultimate goal of sensing a single nuclear spin.",283296,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Spatially-resolved correlation dynamics in multiferroic Dy0.7Tb0.3FeO3,"The desire to control materials functionality by harnessing microscopic correlations between electronic, spin and lattice degrees of freedom is at the heart of modern condensed matter physics. Multiferroics represent a particularly relevant class of correlated materials because of their magnetoelectric cross-correlations, rendering them promising candidates for electric-field control of magnetization and, consequently, energy-efficient storage devices. In this context, any kind of functionalization is based on changes of state and, most importantly, the dynamics of (multi-)ferroic domains and domain walls. However, despite the immense interest in multiferroics for the past twenty years, switching dynamics in these materials and the impact of microscopic heterogeneity remain a largely open subject.This proposal aims at the development and application of experimental techniques for the investigation of correlation dynamics in multiferroics with high spatio-temporal resolution. Combining the high spatial resolution of Faraday and second harmonic generation imaging with the high temporal resolution of stroboscopic illumination schemes from ultrafast spectroscopy will enable the direct imaging of correlation dynamics without resorting to lock-in detection or related techniques.As a proof of concept, we will explore multiple magnetoelectric correlation phenomena in a novel multiferroic, taking Dy0.7Tb0.3FeO3 (DTFO) as a model system with strong couplings between (anti-)ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order. Specifically, we will target correlation dynamics in thermally, optically, or electrically excited phase transitions, and investigate the dynamics underlying the transfer between multiferroic domains and domain walls.Such time- and spatially resolved studies of multiferroics driven far from equilibrium promise fascinating insights into the dynamics of domain patterns or walls and could thus become a key tool in the development of future multiferroic devices.",283296,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
Light Induced Mechanical and multiphoton phEnomena in atomic arrays,"Atom-photon interactions are one of the most studied interactions in physics. These interactions are critical to the realization of several quantum technologies and the investigation of fundamental phenomena in many-body quantum physics. Yet controlling them at the quantum level in an efficient way is still one of the central challenges in contemporary physics. Subwavelength atomic arrays are emerging as a novel paradigm to realize efficient atoms-photons interactions. They are periodic arrangements of atoms with an interatomic separation smaller than their dipole transition wavelength. Atomic arrays harness dissipation as a resource, improving the control of atom-photon interactions over standard light-matter interfaces.  However, most of the current theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to the single excitation response of atomic arrays, thus neglecting the role of quantum correlations. Exploring these effects is timely as several experiments with subwavelength arrays can access this uncharted domain. This project aims at investigating the correlated many-body dynamics of subwavelength arrays and at studying their potential application in quantum technologies. Combining the fellow expertise in optomechanics, the US Host's deep knowledge of subwavelength arrays and open systems, and the EU Host's mastery of numerical methods for many-body physics, the goal of this research proposal is to establish subwavelength atomic arrays as efficient atom-photon interfaces and carefully model their experimental realization with atoms in optical lattices.",282930,2024,2027,European Commission,Spain; United States,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Advances in Ergodic Geometry,"This project encompasses a research program in the field of ergodic geometry, which concerns the long-term behavior of dynamical systems arising naturally in geometry, particularly in situations where the geometry of the system leads to rich dynamics best studied from a probabilistic point of view. The most natural dynamical system in geometry is the geodesic flow: given an initial position and direction, a particle flows at unit speed along the path that locally minimizes distance. This flow has special importance because of its relationship with the geometry and topology of the underlying space. The shape of the space will often produce geodesic flows with interesting dynamical behavior. Consider, for example, a torus with more than one hole, which can be visualized as a pretzel. Paths in the torus that start close together will usually separate and follow different and unpredictable trajectories around the holes. Typically, such trajectories will eventually look independent of the way they started. This is a model situation in which the dynamics and geometry can be understood using tools of ergodic theory. The PI will pursue research on ergodic geometry in two main directions which take advantage of the interplay between geometric and dynamical techniques. In one direction, the PI studies a variety of new problems in the geodesic flow setting that have become tractable due to recent advances in the state-of-the-art. In another direction, the PI expands on this approach by implementing the ideas of ergodic geometry in a broader class of smooth dynamical systems beyond geodesic flows. This award will also support the training of graduate students, and the participation of undergraduate students in the Ohio State REU program in dynamical systems. This project has three parts. The first part of the project comprises the next phase of the PI’s research on geodesic flows. Problems include thermodynamic formalism for CAT(0) spaces and rates of mixing for a broad class of geodesic flows and reference measures. The second part of the project concerns thermodynamic formalism for a panorama of smooth dynamical systems with non-uniform properties, focusing on dynamics ‘beyond’ rational maps. Complex dynamics has strong analogies with the theory of geodesic flows in negative curvature, and the PI furthers the analogy by importing some novel ideas to that setting. The third part of the project will involve the development of symbolic dynamics for non-compact geodesic flows on manifolds in dimensions 3 and higher. The project includes substantial mentoring and research opportunities for early-career mathematicians.

Collaborative Research: A Systematic and Comprehensive Study of Black Hole-Driven Turbulence in Massive Galactic Systems,"In order to prevent the immediate conversion of a galaxy’s total gas supply into stars, a feedback mechanism must exist to slow down star formation. One promising candidate is the injection of turbulence into a galaxy’s supply of gas by a super-massive black hole. This research team has developed a technique to measure gas turbulence in systems hosting giant central black holes and will directly evaluate the viability of this mechanism using a large sample of galaxies. The team will work with artists/graphic designers to integrate their work into a series of freely available planetarium shows, mentor under-represented groups in STEM research, support a postdoc and a graduate student, and introduce undergraduates to astronomical research. This project is jointly funded by MPS/AST and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This project will deliver a more complete view of the “feedback” provided by accreting SMBHs, leading to a better understanding of the black hole-host galaxy relation. More specifically, it will directly probe the energetics of the intra-cluster, circum-galactic, and interstellar media of massive early-type galaxies. The origin of turbulence, the coupling between hot and cold gas, and the microscopic physics will be revealed through the gas kinematics of these systems at different mass scales using X-ray (Chandra), visible (VLT/MUSE), and sub-millimeter (ALMA) observations. The innovative technique of studying the velocity structure of multi-phase filaments has the potential to be a more direct and accurate way to probe turbulent gas motion, vis-a-vis X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis, resonant scattering analysis, and even the direct X-ray line width measurement with Hitomi. This project will be a pathfinder for the calorimeter-based X-ray observatories of the next generation such as XRISM, Athena-XIFU, and Lynx.

THz Frequency combs with Vertical-External-Cavity Surface-Emitting-Lasers,"The objective of this research is to demonstrate terahertz quantum-cascade (QC) metasurface laser frequency combs (FC),characterize these combs in the frequency and time-domain using novel coherent photonic techniques, and to explorethe physics of comb states, including frequency-modulated (FM) quantum-walk combs as well as amplitude-modulated(AM) combs producing ultrafast mode-locked pulses.The proposed project is a collaboration between Prof. Giacomo Scalari at ETH Zürich and Prof. BenjaminWilliams at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). In the past several years, Prof. Williams’ group has pioneered a novel configuration for terahertz QC-lasers in the vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser architecture / VECSEL). The enabling component is an amplifying metasurface, in which the amplifying QC material is embedded directly into a reflectarray with engineerable bandwidth, gain/loss, and phase response/dispersion characteristics.Prof. Scalari at ETH Zürich has produced a consistent effort in waveguide-based THz QC-laser frequency combs, and in particular Prof.Scalari’s group has strong expertise in the coherent characterization of THz QCL FCs using Shifted Wave Interference Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, and has constructed a unique experimental setup which canbe used to measure the temporal profiles of periodic THz signals. The two groups will collaborate in the design, fabrication and characterization  of QC-VECSELs FC’s, that offer novel opportunities from both a scientific and technicalpoint of view. Scientifically, this system occupies a unique region parameter space for the study of FC states. First, the QC-laser gain material generally has a fast gain recovery time (comparedto the cavity round-trip time) that can be engineered from a few picoseconds to tens of ps. Second, the light-matter interaction is mediated through the resonant antennas of the metasurface, all of which have the same spatial mode overlap with the QC gain material resulting in the absence of  spatial hole burning ordinarily found in a Fabry-Pérotcavity. This will allow the exploration of unusual locking regimes normally observable only in ring cavities, like the recently demonstrated quantum walk comb.Third, the use of an external cavity allows very long cavities with close comb tooth spacings (< 1 GHz ); alternatively the fact that the gain metasurface is opticallythin means the cavity can be made as short as a few wavelengths, reducing  the roundtriptime if desired. Technically , the QC-VECSEL has several potential advantages overwaveguide based QC-lasers, including large scalable powers, excellent near-diffraction limited beam patterns thatdon’t depend on frequency, the ability to readily modulate the cavity length (and thus comb tooth spacing) for tuningand stabilization, and the ability to incorporate additional cavity elements for dispersion compensation.We plan to organize our work along the following research themes:• Amplitude Modulated (AM) Combs: active mode locking of VECSEL. In this case we will exploitthe relatively long lifetimes (20-30 ps) of THz active regions based on diagonal transitions to produce shortpulses and broadband combs in dispersion-engineered VECSEL cavities by strongRF modulation close to the cavity round-trip frequency.• Frequency Modulated (FM) combs: photonic quantum-walk comb in VECSEL. The absence ofspatial hole burning combined with shorter upper state lifetimes (vertical transitions) can lead, under strongRF resonant modulation, to a quantum walk comb, featuring large bandwidth and flat-top spectra.We will  develop novel broadband and low-dispersion metasurfaces, new microfabrication process to allow for reduced power consumption metasurfaces with larger areas, dispersion compensation elements and integrating them in the VECSEL  cavities, characterization of the resulting combs for the first time using a suite of coherent characterization methods",282096,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; United States,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
The ghost algebra for correlation functions of Anosov representations and the Weil Petersson gradient flow for renormalized volume,"A topological surface is a space which is allowed to change its shape by stretching but without tearing. Understanding the geometry of the collection of these possible shapes, called the moduli space of the surface, has applications in a number of subfields of math and physics. Expanding on previous work, the PI will investigate properties of a particular flow on the moduli space that minimizes the distortions in a controllable way. This work is at the intersection of math and physics and is expected to lead to new connections between the two fields. The project will also introduce a new tool called the ghost algebra which allows one to track and extract properties of variations of quantities such as lengths. This grant will support graduate students in their research and travel, as well as the PI’s mentoring of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The PI will also co-organize conferences and workshops to support the career development of junior researchers. The findings from this research will be shared widely through conferences and seminars, fostering new connections between mathematics and physics. This project has two main areas of study 1) the ghost algebra for correlation functions of Anosov representations and 2) the Weil Petersson gradient flow for renormalized volume. In the first, the PI and collaborators will study the symplectic structure of Higher Teichmüller spaces via the Hamiltonian flows of correlation functions by introducing a new combinatorial object called the ghost bracket on the ghost algebra of ghost polygons that allows one to compute Poisson brackets of correlation functions. In renormalized volume, the PI and collaborators will continue their program to use the Weil-Petersson gradient flow of renormalized volume to study the structure of hyperbolic three-manifolds. This program has been very successful culminating in recently completely describing the flow for acylindrical manifolds and relatively acylindrical manifolds. This sets the stage to attack the general case which will occupy the majority of this part of the research program.

Developing Quasi Absolute Method (QAM) and 3-D Isotopic Imaging with Neutron Activation,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Sun's group at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is developing methods to facilitate chemical analysis by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), an important method for discerning the identity and abundance of chemical elements in a sample. His innovative approach aims to eliminate the reliance on calibration materials and to extend the tools for imaging analysis, with potential applications in agriculture, industry, medicine, and the military. The project is providing valuable research training for students underrepresented in STEM, preparing them for future STEM careers. Additionally, Dr. Sun is creating advanced course materials on ""Nuclear Activation Analysis"" which will be made available online. Under this award, Professor Sun’s group will advance the quasi-absolute method (QAM) and incorporate QAM calculations into neutron radiography to generate 3-D concentration images of target nuclides. They use neutron flux measurements and Monte Carlo simulations to optimize QAM, validate the pulse activity equation, customize NAA calculation software, and employ 3-D imaging reconstruction techniques to visualize isotopic distributions in samples. By amalgamating contemporary data mining techniques with traditional radioanalytical approaches, the overarching goal is to advance the understanding and application of nuclear activation analysis and nuclear imaging across diverse scientific disciplines.

Nonunitary superconducting states in multiorbital systems.,"Nonunitary superconducting (SC) states are among the most fascinating examples of unconventional Cooper pairing. Their condensate wave function breaks multiple symmetries and features a flavor polarisation, often with exotic topological properties. In simple systems, they have been extensively studied. A paradigmatic example is spin-triplet Cooper pairs, with fundamental applications in spintronics [1].  Nonunitary superconductivity (NUSC) in complex multiorbital systems is expected to be even more intriguing. The pairing polarisation of nonunitary SC states may indeed involve multiple degrees of freedom paving the way for new technological advancements and quantum devices. Yet, NUSC in complex systems is still poorly understood and its exotic properties largely unexplored. Theoretical and experimental investigations suggest that coexisting non-superconducting orders could be crucial for NUSC stabilization.  However, several questions remain open. In particular: which electronic orders intertwine with superconductivity to foster the emergence of NUSC in complex systems? What are the general criteria that allow a given system to accommodate such a state? Which experimental fingerprints provide unambiguous evidence for NUSC in complex systems?MultiNUSC aims to meet these challenges via a synergistic combination of advanced theoretical concepts and techniques, ranging from analytical computations to numerical simulations, benefiting from the perfect match between the host supervisor and the Experienced Researcher.This action will pursue the following objectives. Objective 1 aims to study the mechanisms stabilizing NUSC within a multiorbital microscopic model that includes the competition (or cooperation) between superconductivity and other electronic orders. Recently, it has been shown that the interplay of charge-density waves (CDW) with superconductivity can promote NUSC in a multiorbital system [2]. Objective 1 will take a step further by comparing the effect of various other electronic orders to shed light on the key mechanisms underlying NUSC stabilization. The study of the resulting band structures will also clarify the specific changes observed for Dirac materials and recently attributed to NUSC [3].Objective 2 is to identify the optimal conditions for the onset of NUSC in complex systems by employing and extending the concept of superconducting fitness [4] (SCFit). Introduced by A. Ramires a few years ago, this versatile diagnostic tool provides a quantitative measure for the compatibility between a specific SC pairing state and the underlying electronic structure. Despite the SCFit having already revealed important insights on NUSC [5], a systematic study of the electronic structures that better support such a state is still missing.   At the same time, Objective 2 aims to extend the SCFit framework to other electronic orders providing a new theoretical tool to study the onset of different non-SC states and complement Objective 1 in singling out the relevant electronic orders to consider. This objective will benefit from direct collaboration with A. Ramires.Objective 3 is to identify new decisive experimental criteria to detect NUSC in multiorbital systems. This aim will be achieved by studying the vortex matter physics in multiorbital nonunitary superconductors. The structure of vortices in nonunitary SC states is indeed experimentally accessible via scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and can provide a possible detection probe.  At the same time, Objective 3 is also to assess the finite-temperature phase diagram of the system by studying how these vortices nucleate and interact. This is particularly interesting since multiple intertwined orders with superconductivity can result in a rich and complex phase diagram, where the partial melting of different orders may give rise to new vestigial states [6] even above the SC transition. A paradigmatic example is fermion quadrupling condensates [7], which emerge from the proliferation of specific excitations of topological phases. The first experimental observation of a fermion quadrupling condensate with TRSB dates back only a year [8].The results of this action are expected to be of high impact.MultiNUSC will provide crucial insights into the microscopic origin of unconventional SC pairings from the intertwining of different electronic orders, shedding light on the stabilization and detection of NUSC in multiorbital systems. The extension of the concept of SCFit, with the introduction of a new diagnostic tool for different electronic orders, will have a high scientific impact due to the transversality of its applications, including other classes of unconventional superconductors. The study of the vortex matter will reveal new key fingerprints of NUSC in complex systems while unveiling possible new unconventional states of matter even above the SC critical temperature. Finally, the results expected from MultiNUSC will prompt new interest in the fields especially given the new technological advancements that can be unfolded from the study of the non-trivially polarised pairing function of nonunitary SC states.[1] J.

Non-Adiabatic Photonic Processes in Molecular Plasma,"For various applications in science and industry, there is a growing need for large amounts of data on molecular processes. Such data can partially be produced experimentally; however, the experimental approach is typically very laborious and expensive. This project is focused on the development of theoretical approaches to model the behavior of air molecules (mainly, oxygen - O2, nitrogen-N2, water-H2O, and to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide - CO2) in the presence of ionizing radiation. Among technological applications of the data to be produced are intense and/or ultraviolet laser propagation, semiconductor industry (plasma assisted etching and lithography), and remote sensing. The project will also contribute to training graduate and undergraduate students, with a focus on the development of critical analysis capabilities and preparation of future researchers in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UCF automatically provides a diverse pool of students. It is expected that about half of the students involved in the research will be from under-represented groups. Also, as another educational impact, the development of digital learning environments to teach undergraduate and graduate-level courses related to quantum technology will be continued, in collaboration with a colleague from Ecole CentraleSupelec (Orsay, France). The previously developed environment was a success and is being routinely used in the courses on quantum mechanics. The project is focused on the development of several theoretical and numerical methods to compute cross sections and branching ratios in photoionization of diatomic and triatomic molecules, accounting for electronic, vibrational, and -- if needed – the rotational structure of the molecules. The coupling between the ground and one or two excited electronic states of the molecular ion and the departing photoelectron will also be accounted for. The developed methods will be applied to study photoionization of air molecules: N2, O2, and H2O. The results will be benchmarked on available data on photoionization of O2 and N2. Photoionization spectra and branching ratios will be produced to help modelers to develop applications as well as to experimentalists and astronomers to interpret observed spectra. A theoretical first-principles approach able to describe photoionization of small molecules, accounting for vibronic coupling of the photoelectron with the molecular ion will be developed. The approach will combine several elements: the molecular multi-channel quantum defect theory, the UK R-matrix codes for electron-molecule scattering calculations and geometry-fixed transition dipole moments, the vibrational frame transformation, hyperspherical and normal mode coordinates for the triatomic molecule (H2O). As a continuation of the previous grant, the obtained results will be used to consider cavity-free lasing in the diatomic molecular ions. A time-dependent quantum defect approach, currently being developed in the group, will be implemented to study pump-probe schemes for O2 and N2.

Syzygies and Koszul Algebras,"This award supports research in commutative algebra – the study of the set of solutions of systems of multi-variate polynomial equations. Specifically, the project involves the study of free resolutions and Koszul algebras. Free resolutions are technical objects that allow us to approximate complicated algebraic objects by simpler ones. They can often be computed using computer algebra systems such as Macaulay2. Koszul algebras have particularly nice free resolutions and arise in a surprising number of contexts, especially in geometry and combinatorics. As part of this project, the PI seeks to classify certain Koszul algebras in several specific areas of interest. More broadly, the PI will supervise the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The PI will also begin work on a new textbook on commutative algebra with Macaulay2. A free resolution of a module over a commutative ring is an acyclic sequence of free modules whose zero-th homology equals the module. In the graded setting, resolutions are unique up to isomorphism and encode useful information about the module being resolved. Koszul algebras are graded algebras over a field such that the field has a linear free resolution over the algebra. The PI seeks to establish new classes Koszul algebras related to hyperplane arrangements (via Orlik-Solomon algebras), lattices and matroids (specifically Chow rings and graded Moebius algebras), toric rings (specifically matroid base rings, in connection to White’s Conjecture), and binomial edge ideals. Additionally, the PI will study the Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture in the normal setting, where it is still an open question.

Flows induced within planetary fluid layers through the interplay of thermal convection and orbital perturbations.,"In this project, we aim to conduct numerical investigations into the fluid dynamics within planetary fluid envelopes, driven by the combined effects of thermal convection and orbital perturbations, such as libations. Our goal is to comprehend the conditions under which these steering mechanisms either enhance or counteract one another and how these interactions impact heat transfer, chemical mixing, energy dissipation, and magnetic field generation.Over the past four decades, the scientific community has invested significant efforts in studying convection and orbitally driven flows independently, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of their linear and nonlinear dynamics in isolation. However, in many planetary bodies, including Earth but not limited to it, both convection and orbital perturbations operate simultaneously, creating complex dynamics that remain poorly understood. This problem is highly intricate, and conducting numerical simulations of combined convection and orbitally driven flows poses significant challenges. Currently, there is no systematic exploration of the parameter space in this context, limiting our analysis and comprehension of the underlying dynamics.Part of this project will be dedicated to constructing a database of numerical simulations for flows driven by the combined effects of convection and libration in longitude, a specific form of orbital forcing. To achieve this, we will utilize the state-of-the-art code Xshell, enabling us to explore an unprecedentedly wide range of parameters and create a stability diagram. Our aim is to determine how the interplay between the two steering mechanisms affects thermal and inertial instabilities and how this, in turn, modifies heat transfer, energy spectra, and the generation of zonal flow.Simultaneously, we will address more focused questions to unveil the mechanisms governing the interaction between convection and orbitally driven flows. Convection unfolds slowly compared to the planetary rotational period, resulting in predominantly zonal circulations and quasi-2D columnar structures. Conversely, orbitally driven flows operate on diurnal timescales, primarily generating 3D inertial modes and waves. We contend that the mutual interactions between these flows have been overlooked motivated by timescale separation and flow symmetry arguments.Using the high-performance and highly flexible code Dedalus, we will investigate how a prescribed differential rotation of the fluid cavity, such as a zonal circulation superimposed to a solid body rotation, modifies the linear dynamics of 3D inertial waves and inertial modes. This inquiry is of great interest to both the geophysical and astrophysical communities, particularly in the context of helioseismology, where inertial waves and modes offer unique insights into dynamics that are not accessible through classical acoustic waves.",277348,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; France,Switzerland,Space Sciences
RUI: PDE and Geometry in non-smooth spaces,"This award supports a project which investigates topics in the theory of partial differential equations in the setting of non-smooth spaces. Partial differential equations provide a powerful mathematical tool to gain insights about equilibrium states of complex physical systems which arise as solutions of certain equations. The properties of the solutions to these equations depend on a “background geometry” that models physical features such as the non-homogeneity of materials or the presence of constraints (such as the constraints inherent in the motion of a robotic arm). In many important physical applications, one encounters non-smooth geometries (for instance, fractals) which differ fundamentally from the familiar geometry of Euclidean space, so that standard notions from calculus must be reformulated from a broader perspective. One of the most ubiquitous instances of such “background geometry” is known as sub-Riemannian geometry, which models spaces in which motion is possible only along a given set of directions. This non-smooth geometry is widely useful in modeling physical phenomena, for example, in robotics, quantum mechanics, and neuroscience. This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on research projects arising from the proposed work. The PI will study sub-Riemannian analogues of the curve shortening flow; the regularity of solutions of certain degenerate elliptic parabolic PDE and non-local PDE in the general setting of certain metric spaces endowed with a doubling measure. The common thread between these investigations is the interplay between the non-smooth structure of the space and the behavior of solutions of equations describing critical points of interesting energy functionals. Some of the proposed research will provide a theoretical basis for implementing numerical simulations of real-world systems.

Magnetism in vanadium-based intercalation compounds of transition metal dichalcogenides,"Non-technical description: Exotic magnetic materials hold great promise for next-generation devices that leverage the spin of the electron to store information (so-called spintronic devices). Such devices hold the promise to possess higher storage densities, greater security to external probes, lower power consumption, and faster switching dynamics. Altermagnets are a recently identified class of magnetic material that display highly attractive functional properties that are more traditionally associated with ferromagnets such as iron. These novel materials offer advantages for electrical control and read-out compared to traditional antiferromagnets but still possess the properties that are desirable for ultra-compact, miniaturized devices. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of California Berkeley synthesize materials that have been proposed as potential altermagnets but not have not yet been realized. Prof. Bediako and his research group investigate these materials to understand how their solid-state structure and compositional variations dictate their magnetic and electronic properties. These research efforts are integrated with education and outreach initiatives that seek to broaden participation in STEM education and scientific research, in particular through the tutoring of incarcerated students at Mount Tamalpais College at San Quentin State Rehabilitation Center in mathematics, science, and computer science. Technical description: Intercalation compounds of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a highly tunable platform for designing the magnetic properties of materials for next-generation spintronics. In this class of solids, changing the transition metal dichalcogenide host lattice, the intercalant identity, and intercalation stoichiometry modulates emergent magnetic behavior. The magnetic properties of these intercalation compounds are also highly sensitive to the nature of defects/disorder within the intercalant lattice. Compared to studies of Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co intercalation in TMDs, there are very limited experimental data in the literature on TMD intercalation compounds of vanadium, despite a few recently having been theoretically proposed as a candidate altermagnetic material - a recently proposed magnetic phase classification that has distinctive electronic and spintronic properties that set it apart from conventional antiferromagnets. More broadly, for the family of V-intercalated TMDs, an understanding of how intercalant stoichiometry alters magnetic properties is completely lacking. This knowledge gap presents critical impediments for an intuitive, chemical understanding of how d-electron count, intercalant structure, and magnetic exchange dictate the varied magnetic properties in intercalated TMDs. In turn, this knowledge gap impedes the rational design of magnetic materials with desirable properties (higher operating temperatures, more efficient spin–charge conversion for spintronics, etc.). To address this challenge, researchers at the University of California Berkeley focus on the synthesis, structural characterization of V-intercalated TMDs and elucidation of connections between synthetic conditions, structure, and physical properties. They use a combination of solid-state synthesis, crystal growth, x-ray and electron diffraction, neutron scattering, magnetometry, and electronic transport measurements to unveil the fundamental knowledge needed to synthesize high purity materials and control exotic magnetic behavior. This work deepens the understanding of fundamental structure-property relationships in intercalation compounds and builds a framework for understanding how to manipulate magnetic and electronic phenomena through solid-state synthesis and materials chemistry principles.

Novel Approaches to Geometry of Moduli Spaces,"Algebraic geometry has long occupied a central role in mathematics, providing a sophisticated language to describe geometric shapes known as algebraic varieties - with applications ranging from configuration spaces in physics to parametric models in statistics. This versatile language is used throughout algebra and has fueled multiple recent advances, not only in algebraic geometry itself but also in representation theory, number theory, symplectic geometry and other fields. Algebraic varieties are typically endowed with additional structures, such as vector bundles. Local sections of vector bundles are mathematical abstractions of fields in physics, making algebraic geometry indispensable for the study of physical phenomena like mirror symmetry and other dualities. A recurring theme in moduli theory is the interplay between moduli spaces of vector bundles, which parametrize them geometrically and can be studied analytically, and the derived categories of algebraic varieties, which encode algebraic and homological properties of vector bundles. Derived categories provide a bridge from algebraic geometry to the emerging field of non-commutative geometry. Indeed, functors and equivalences between derived categories are deeply related to the birational (local) geometry of algebraic varieties. This project will further the study of derived categories. The PI will deliver graduate-level mini-courses and lectures at conferences, professional development events, and summer schools for graduate students. Many sub-projects are suitable as thesis topics for graduate students. Furthermore, several problems are designed specifically for undergraduate participants in the research and training program in algebraic geometry organized by the PI. In more detail, the proposed reserch is centered around two main themes. The first is the study of derived categories of moduli spaces and Fano varieties more broadly. The derived categories of Fano varieties, unlike Calabi-Yau or most canonically polarized varieties, admit semi-orthogonal decompositions; from the perspective of non-commutative geometry, Fano varieties are built from more elementary blocks. A beautiful picture emerges, where the decompositions of various Fano varieties, related by birational transformations, undergo rearrangements, which we call weaving patterns. Their construction is motivated by ideas of mirror symmetry, quantum cohomology, vanishing theorems of the minimal model program, and quantization. The PI will advance this program for a wide variety of spaces: moduli spaces of vector bundles, parabolic bundles and Higgs bundles on curves, toric varieties, flag varieties, moduli of sheaves with one-dimensional support on K3 surfaces, and fixed-point loci of anti-symplectic involutions on projective hyperkahler varieties. The second theme is to continue the study of the categorical Milnor fiber for deformations of singular algebraic varieties, describe its mirror symmetry interpretation, and find applications to moduli of algebraic surfaces of geometric genus zero, including Dolgachev surfaces and fake del Pezzo surfaces.

Quantum Materials: Harnessing Helicates and Radicals in Synergy,"This is a multidisciplinary project that combines original organic and inorganic chemical synthesis with advanced electronic resonance spectroscopy to produce the next generation of multifunctional molecular quantum processor prototypes. 
Quantum technologies will embody the second quantum revolution, bound to change dramatically the landscape of information processing, communications and nanotechnology, thereby bringing profound changes to society. This could be realized through the coherent manipulation of the electronic or nuclear spin degrees of freedom. In this context, the growing importance of spin-bearing molecules as the potential physical platform to realize quantum technologies demands the design and precise characterization of the required molecular components with the appropriate functions. The objective of this proposal is to generate molecular qubits bearing functional components for their implementation. These components will be, a) single ion magnets (SIMs) to engender a local magnetic field for individual qubit operation, b) spin crossover (SCO) centers to provide a mechanism for tuning the qubit quantum coherence using light, c) molecular units exhibiting magnetocaloric effect (MCE) to generate a local mechanism for qubit refrigeration, or d) ancillary qubits to realize multiqubit quantum gates within molecules. A first period at Windsor University (Canada) will be dedicated to the synthesis of hybrid main group radical/coordination chemistry compounds. A six-month secondment at the National High Magnetic Laboratory in Florida (USA) will allow deep characterization of the compounds prepared and quality training in pulsed EPR.

Modeling of proton RBE variations in patients,"In radio-oncology, as in many other fields of medicine, predictive algorithms are becoming established for estimating cancer cure rates or risks of complications, and will be increasingly ubiquitous in the years to come. A key aspect of accurately predicting treatment outcome is understanding the biological effects that radiation has on cancer cells and normal tissues that, despite our best efforts, still receive the dose due to their proximity to the treatment site. Today, for selected indications where dose constraints are particularly demanding, such as in the treatment of pediatric patients or for deep seated brain tumors, proton therapy can offer an alternative to conventional photon treatments. However, the improved precision of protons comes with an increased complexity in energy deposition, with implications for the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton dose. Historically, a fixed RBE of 1.1 has been chosen to scale the biological effectiveness of protons and to be able to transfer dose constraints between modalities. Although treatment protocols are standardized, not all patients react similarly to treatment. In clinical practice, cases in which causality between administered dose and radiation-induced complications cannot be established are not rare. In such cases, it is difficult to differentiate between the natural variability of radio-sensitivity between patients being the only cause, or whether this may due to limitations in our understanding of proton RBE. In this project proposal, therefore, we aim to test whether in vivo observations can be used to significantly improve our modelling of treatment response and shed light on complications and unexpected relapses reported in clinical operations. We hypothesize that (i) it is possible to improve our understanding of proton RBE from analysis of clinical outcomes, (ii) quantitative imaging can be used to resolve tumor specificity and (iii) a review of the biological effectiveness of proton dose will change the weight given to risk factors and dose constraints used in clinical treatments.Although the use of a fixed RBE is a pragmatic approximation, it is well documented that in-vitro biological efficacy varies with proton range and biophysical considerations. Due to the scarcity of clinical data from patients undergoing proton therapy however, biological effects of proton radiation are mostly modelled from irradiation of cell lines, thus potentially being biased by the absence of 'tissue effects' in the patient. Having delivered proton therapy treatments for over two decades, the Paul Scherrer Institute has reached the critical numbers to review proton RBE by analyzing past years of treatments for local toxicity and recurrence. Hence our determination to make the best use of the clinical data at our disposal and to expand our knowledge of the in vivo biological response to proton radiation. Local control and brain tissue toxicities as assessed from over 200 chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients treated at out institute will be pooled and processed with advanced data analysis methods to obtain the best fit models for our clinical observations. Predicting treatment efficacy against the likelihood of complication is key to optimal patient care, and modelling biological response to therapy underpins this goal. As proton therapy becomes an accessible option for patients in hospital settings, the progressive availability of clinical follow-up data makes the engineering of predictive models a key research field in the coming years. With this proposal, we are moving along these lines, focusing on specific aspects of validation and refinement of predictive technologies applied to proton therapy, while improving our knowledge of RBE in patients.",272170,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Toward a Spectral Foundation Model,"Stellar spectra are the primary way we learn about stars, including their composition, age, and special features like star spots or hidden companion stars. Although we can now observe millions of star spectra, our current methods aren't robust enough to fully explain what this starlight reveals about stars. This project aims to resolve this problem: how to connect the latest computer models of stars with the vast number of stellar spectra we've collected. The researchers will use new artificial intelligence (AI) methods to create AI models. They will then combine these models with detailed computer simulations to analyze star spectra more effectively. This research aligns with national priorities, using AI to accelerate research and training new experts who are knowledgeable in both scientific research and AI. The investigators will develop spectral foundational models—robust AI models pre-trained on vast numbers of simplified stellar spectral models. These models will be designed to capture the underlying atomic and plasma physics of stellar atmospheres through carefully crafted training tasks. While simplified one-dimensional physical models assuming spherical symmetry are easy to generate, they lack nuance. Conversely, detailed three-dimensional models with full non-hydrostatics, though accurate, are resource-intensive and can only be generated sparingly. To address this challenge, the researchers will harness the latest Transformer-based neural network models, establishing methods for pre-training these models with robust unsupervised tasks aimed at teaching the models to grapple with the underlying complex physics in stellar atmospheres. Building upon the AI foundational model, the team will integrate it with vertex frameworks and probability density estimators with neural networks. The research team will examine two specific science cases. First, they will elucidate star-spot distributions using spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Second, they will infer characteristics of stellar populations, including age, mass, and metallicity distributions, from galaxy spectra collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

MRI: Track 1 Acquisition of a Low Voltage Electron Microscope at the College of Charleston,"This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program. The College of Charleston is acquiring a low-voltage benchtop electron microscope to support the research of Professor Kate Mullaugh and colleagues Chris Freeman, Yu Gong and Antonio Ruotolo. This instrument has the capability to collect images on the micro- and nanoscales through both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, enhancing the research capabilities of the College of Charleston in materials and life sciences. On-campus access to this instrument will provide undergraduate students with hands-on experience with electron microscopy in both teaching and research labs across the departments of chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering. This acquisition also fills a regional need for access to electron microscopy and the instrument will be used in outreach activities. This award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It will greatly improve access to imaging capabilities related to materials science as electron microscopy is a cornerstone tool for research and innovation at the sub-micron scale. This low-voltage model will provide opportunities to characterize a range of materials and the ability to collect images in both scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) modes greatly increases the range of applications that this instrument will find among its users.

Effective Field Theories beyond NLO,"The goal of this project is to compute the 2-loop anomalous dimensions of Wilson coefficients of an Effective Field Theory up to dimension 6. An efficient algorithm, agnostic of the details of the Effective Field Theory in question will be established, and an open source implementation of it will be provided, along with results for many specific theories, including the SMEFT. Interfaces to various external codes for simulation, numerical solution of the renormalization group equations, and fitting will be supplied, facilitating the usage of our results by collaborations that translate experimental data to constraints for new physics models.

A variety of theoretical issues will be explored",270173,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Explorations in Quantum Gravity: Cosmological and Black Hole Spacetimes,"Though Einstein’s theory of General relativity is immensely successful in describing the evolution of our Universe from the moments after the Big Bang till the present epoch, it breaks down near the cosmological and black hole singularities. The fundamental questions about the resolution of singularities, initial conditions of the universe, and the emergence of space and time from the Big Bang have remained open for many decades. Answering these questions requires a union of gravity and quantum theory, which is one of the fundamental problems in theoretical physics. In recent years, progress in applying techniques of loop quantum gravity has allowed us to concretely answer these questions in various cosmological and black hole spacetimes. This award aims to explore quantum gravity effects in various spacetimes to understand how to resolve problems of singularities, how to extract new physics beyond Einstein’s General Relativity, and how to potentially test this new physics using cosmic microwave background experiments. Progress in answering these long-standing fundamental questions will not only benefit the wider community but also scientists engaged in research in classical and quantum aspects of gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics. Graduate students will be trained in solving complex problems using rigorous analytical and computational techniques. The main goal of this research is to explore new physics emerging from the quantization of gravity using non-perturbative techniques employed in loop quantum gravity. In the last decade, loop quantization of various cosmological and black hole spacetimes has provided important insights into the resolution of singularities and potential signatures in the cosmic microwave background. This award aims to answer multiple fundamental questions in this approach. The goals include: (i) Understanding the way quantum gravity effects affect the Mixmaster dynamics and singularities in anisotropic models and the fate of singularities in inhomogeneous spacetimes, such as Gowdy models; (ii) The way different regularization and quantization ambiguities affect the physics at the Planck scale, and how one can phenomenologically constrain these ambiguities; (iii) Exploring the consequences of polymer matter in loop quantized spacetimes; (iv) Loop quantization of black hole spacetimes; and (v) Addressing foundational issues in quantum cosmology such as quantum to classical transition and quantum probabilities. This research is expected to significantly broaden and advance our understanding of the physical implications of quantum gravity and lead to insights into the nature of spacetime beyond Einstein’s theory of General Relativity.

Many-Body Neutrino Quantum Kinetics,"The behavior of neutrinos in stellar supernova explosions and neutron star mergers determine the amount and composition of the matter that form subsequent generations of stars and planets, but it is yet unclear whether these events are able to explain the origin of all of the heaviest elements in the universe. Supernovae and mergers generate all three flavors (i.e., types) of neutrinos, but the ability of neutrinos to change their type is a fundamentally quantum mechanical process that has a strong impact on the synthesis of heavy elements. The complexity of quantum mechanics applied to a large number of entangled neutrinos is vastly too expensive to be included in even supercomputer simulations of astrophysical explosions. So a robust connection between the basic quantum mechanics and efficient modeling approximations needs to be drawn. The PI will perform the first multidimensional simulations of rapid neutrino flavor transformation processes under both levels of approximation. This apples-to-apples comparison will anchor our understanding of our origins in basic quantum mechanics. The PI will mentor undergraduate and graduate students engaged in the research and will host an international summer workshop week to make the state-of-the-art methods developed during the project globally accessible. The project seeks to establish a robust link between exact many-body and approximate mean-field calculations of the dominant neutrino flavor instabilities in core-collapse supernova and neutron star merger environments. These instabilities are inherently anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and the state-of-the-art simulations of mean-field flavor instabilities have no direct basis for comparison with many-body theory. The project involves developing a many-body neutrino simulation framework using tensor network methods that treats neutrinos as localized particles moving in three-dimensional space. The mean-field and many-body limits will be compared by tuning a single parameter (i.e., the bond dimension of the tensor network) that determines the amount of quantum entanglement that can build between neutrinos. This will enable the first comparison of 1D and 2D simulations of the Fast Flavor Instability under exactly identical assumptions in both limits, except for the amount of entanglement allowed. In situations where mean-field and many-body results agree, effective treatments of flavor transformation in dynamical supernova and merger simulations based on local simulations of flavor transformation will be justified. Enhancements to effective flavor transformation treatments will be proposed for situations where results diverge. This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.

Unravelling the Origin of the Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry in the Universe,"Even with the extraordinary success of the the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM), certain phenomena observed in the Universe that have profound consequences to life as we know it, such as the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the hierarchy problem, and the existence of dark matter and dark energy, remain unexplained. Therefore any physical description of such phenomena requires a theory that goes beyond the Standard Model (BSM), while at the same time encompassing the Standard Model and its predictions related to ordinary matter. A physical quantity potentially sensitive to the source responsible of the matter-antimatter asymmetry is the electric dipole moment (EDM) of particles such as the neutron and proton. The PI will study the impact of theories beyond the Standard Model to the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe by calculating the electric dipole moments of protons and neutrons induced by such theories. In addition to investigating the role played by theories beyond the Standard Model to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, which is one of the biggest unanswered questions in particle and nuclear physics, the PI will mentor a student engaged in this research. This project uses a new method, based on the so-called gradient flow, for the determination of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) component of key BSM matrix elements related to quark and strong theta-CP violations. This set of matrix elements impacts the understanding of electric dipole moments (EDMs) within nucleons and nuclei (a key signature of BSM physics), and their determination will lay the foundation for extraction of BSM observables from future low-energy, high-intensity experimental measurements. The use of the gradient flow will circumvent some of the big challenges posed by the determination of the above-mentioned matrix elements by introducing a new scale, the flow time, that will mitigate divergences present in the calculations. Additionally the gradient flow is perfectly suited to be adopted to QCD calculations on the lattice. Lattice QCD is, as today, the only robust and theoretically sound approach to non-perturbative QCD calculations. The new method the PI has developed is ideally suited for calculating all the CP-violating contributions to the EDM of nucleons and light nuclei. Most of the tools and technique developed in this project are alternative to traditional methods and can be easily applied to other matrix element calculations contributing to the study of dark matter candidates.

Unraveling the Structure of Dark Matter,"One of the most prominent and exciting challenges in fundamental physics is understanding the nature of dark matter, which accounts for 85% of all matter throughout the known Universe. Dark matter plays a crucial role in forming galaxies, galaxy clusters, and larger structures of matter through its gravitational effects on ordinary particles. A key question is whether or not dark matter experiences any forces beyond gravity. The PI's research program will tackle the dark matter problem at the intersection of cosmology and particle physics, using cosmological and astrophysical observations to study the microscopic properties of dark matter. Such observations have emerged as a powerful probe of dark matter, due to their increase in precision and sensitivity over recent years. The PI's research will provide foundational work for future dark matter analyses, in preparation for potential new discoveries as next-generation instruments and surveys begin operations in the upcoming decade. In conjunction with research, this program includes the mentoring and support of undergraduate women in physics. This research will study the impact of dark matter interactions with ordinary particles and dark matter self-interactions throughout cosmic time. These interactions can affect the formation and evolution of dark matter structures, thereby enabling the opportunity to search for new dark matter physics using current and future cosmological and astrophysical observations. This research will pursue new avenues to bridge theoretical models and observational techniques to study dark matter. It will involve the development of sophisticated tools to perform joint analyses using multiple datasets.

Exploring Dark Matter and other Physics Beyond the Standard Model,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Pearl Sandick at the University of Utah. It’s a profound fact that the nature of more than 80% of the matter content of the Universe is unknown. This so-called ""dark matter"" has thus far been observed only via its gravitational interactions, but a more comprehensive understanding of its identity, and any behaviors beyond gravitational attraction, is one of the most important outstanding challenges in modern physics. Professor Sandick seeks to understand the nature of dark matter as an avenue to potentially deep and revolutionary insights about the Universe we inhabit, the particles it contains, and how it came to be. This project supports her work on a suite of theoretical studies of dark matter and its impact on astrophysical and cosmological processes, as well as the development of practical tools that will increase efficiency and accuracy of studies searching for signals from dark matter in our galaxy. This work will improve our understanding of dark matter and could potentially lead to a major breakthrough. Furthermore, this project supports efforts to increase inclusivity, retention, and success of talented scientists; activities to educate and engage the public about the science pursued through this project; and the creation and maintenance of computational and community-based infrastructure to enhance prospects for discovery. This research advances the national interest through its potential for innovation and discovery, by increasing human knowledge regarding the composition and dynamics of our Universe, through the training of junior scientists and their workforce potential, and by furthering our world-leading reputation in the basic sciences. More technically, it’s well known that the landscape of observable phenomena that could be related to dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model is vast, probed by terrestrial and space-based experiments and by making use of the cosmos as laboratory. This project reflects that breadth. Professor Sandick will study the indirect detection of dark matter, the impact of dark matter on stellar evolution, and the interplay of dark matter and black holes. Our understanding of the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies continues to become more sophisticated thanks to investments in state-of-the-art observatories and important theoretical advances in understanding the implications of the data. Professor Sandick will leverage this increasing astrophysical knowledge to improve constraints on a wide variety of well-motivated dark matter models. She will pursue new improvements to the Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool (MADHAT), including extending the energy range of photons analyzed with data from different telescopes and integrating MADHAT into popular likelihood calculators for new physics models. Professor Sandick will also undertake a detailed study of the observable effects from early stars for which dark matter may have had a critical impact on their evolution. In a third direction, Professor Sandick will study the interplay of dark matter with black holes, particularly as related to black hole mergers, their dynamics, and observable astrophysical signals.

Representation Theory and Symplectic Geometry Inspired by Topological Field Theory,"Geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry are two subjects of central interest in current mathematics. They draw original inspiration from mathematical physics, often in the form of quantum field theory and specifically the study of its symmetries. This has been an historically fruitful direction guided by dualities that generalize Fourier theory. The research in this project involves a mix of pursuits, including the development of new tools and the solution of open problems. A common theme throughout is finding ways to think about intricate geometric systems in elementary combinatorial terms. The research also offers opportunities for students entering these subjects to make significant contributions by applying recent tools and exploring new approaches. Additional activities include educational and expository writing on related topics, new interactions between researchers in mathematics and physics, and continued investment in public engagement with mathematics. The specific projects take on central challenges in supersymmetric gauge theory, specifically about phase spaces of gauge fields, their two-dimensional sigma-models, and higher structures on their branes coming from four-dimensional field theory. The main themes are the cocenter of the affine Hecke category and elliptic character sheaves, local Langlands equivalences and relative Langlands duality, and the topology of Lagrangian skeleta of Weinstein manifolds. The primary goals of the project include an identification of the cocenter of the affine Hecke category with elliptic character sheaves as an instance of automorphic gluing, the application of cyclic symmetries of Langlands parameter spaces to categorical forms of the Langlands classification, and a comparison of polarized Weinstein manifolds with arboreal spaces.

Collaborative Research: Understanding and Manipulating Magnetism and Spin Dynamics in Intercalated van der Waals Magnets,"Non-technical Abstract: Magnets play an essential role in modern technologies such as information storage, energy harvesting, high-speed transportation, water purification, and biomedicine. Commercial devices typically utilize three-dimensional magnets, in the form of bulk crystals or nanostructures, to realize the desired applications. This project focuses on atomically thin layers of two-dimensional magnetic materials, which have remarkable advantages over conventional three-dimensional magnets because of their exotic low-dimensional properties and high sensitivity to external stimuli. The goal of the project is to understand and manipulate the magnetic properties of a novel class of two-dimensional magnets through a highly integrated collaborative effort of two principal investigators with complementary expertise. The fundamental understanding and dynamic control of two-dimensional magnetism is anticipated to pave the way towards the realization of novel ultra-compact devices for modern information technology and beyond. Through the research project, the principal investigators will further their ongoing effort of training students, especially underrepresented minorities, to enhance diversity in STEM research. Meanwhile, interactive outreach activities are planned to promote STEM education in disadvantaged rural or suburban schools and to attract high school students to quantum materials research. Technical Abstract: Two-dimensional magnets offer a unique platform for both the fundamental study of exotic magnetism and the innovation of ultra-compact devices for advanced technologies. The overarching goal of this collaborative research project is to accurately map the magnetic phase diagram and manipulate spin dynamics in a family of self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, chromium tellurides. The experimental activities include: 1) establish precisely controlled intercalation-magnetism relations and create a phase diagram; 2) tuning and determining the relative influence of charge carriers, magnetic moments of intercalants, and atomic lattice spacing on the magnetic properties; 3) probing and manipulating the magnetization and coherent spin dynamics with ultrafast demagnetization, ferromagnetic resonance, and terahertz phonon excitation. The project will create systematic and comprehensive knowledge about magnetism and spin dynamics in this intriguing family of two-dimensional magnets. As such, the research project will offer a new scientific paradigm to understand and engineer two-dimensional intercalated magnetic materials. Correlated with the research components are interactive outreach programs that aim to foster STEM education in disadvantaged rural or suburban schools and inspire high school students by connecting them to quantum research.

Silicon Carbide Qubits towards a Fab-Ready Technology - SiCqurTech,"Spin qubits associated to optically active solid-state defects are being explored as a platform for quantum networks. Recently, the silicon vacancy centre (VSi) in silicon carbide (SiC) was identified as a promising candidate for future scalability. Compared to currently leading platforms, such as the NV centre in diamond, the VSi offers improved potential for nano-photonic device integration and high operation temperatures (up to T=20 K). Additionally, SiC is an industrially mature semiconductor that has the potential for scalable integrated device fabrication.Initial experiments with the VSi centre by our consortium and others have demonstrated quantum control over electron- and nuclear-spin qubits, spin-controlled photon emission8, and excellent spin and optical coherences even after nanophotonic integration3. These experiments provide a promising starting point towards a future SiC quantum technology. Key open challenges are to develop device fabrication methods that are “fab-ready”, in the sense of transferring established CMOS fabrication to quantum device manufacturing or developing new processes that are compatible to clean room operation (i.e., scalable, reliable and without contamination issues). Today, it is unclear whether such processes can be made “quantum-grade”, i.e., permit high-fidelity multi-qubit control and photon-mediated entanglement.SiCqurTech will investigate material growth and fabrication processes to lay the foundation for such a fab-ready technology, and will explore its potential for quantum networks. To this end, we bring together an interdisciplinary European consortium that will: (1) explore the growth of novel quantum-grade SiC with controlled isotopic concentrations; (2) develop fab-compatible SiC-on-insulator technology and electrical control structures via high-throughput characterisation; (3) investigate charge passivating SiC surfaces with low-background fluorescence; (4) demonstrate multi-qubit-control (up to 10 qubits) and photon mediated entanglement. SiCqurTech’s results will create a comprehensive fundamental and practical understanding of the potential of the VSi centre in SiC as a scalable next-generation quantum network technology.",267620,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Netherlands; Sweden,Switzerland,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Unleashing the full potential of free-electron laser through laser-based beam manipulation at low and intermediate energies,"In free-electron laser facilities, such as SwissFEL at the Paul Scherrer Institute, arelativistic electron bunch with small transverse emittance, small energy spreadbut high beam current drives the FEL process in form of a collective instability,where energy from the electron bunch is transferred to coherent emission in theX-ray regime. While such high-brightness electron beams are mandatory fora good FEL performance they are also prone to the microbunching instabilityin the linear accelerator, where any ripple in the current profile is amplifiedby the multi-staged process of induced energy modulation and bunch compres-sion. While the basic Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) operationof SwissFEL is less sensitive to this effect, it will cause a severe degradation inthe planned seeded operation of the soft X-ray beamline Athos.The microbunching instability is damped by inducing an uncorrelated en-ergy spread in the electron beam early on in the machine via the interactionof the beam with a laser field propagating parallel to the beam (so-called laserheater). This type of laser-based beam manipulation can go beyond optimiz-ing the FEL performance of SwissFEL since it allows for a controlled way ofmanipulating the shape of individual pulses in SwissFEL in the context of dualbunch operation of SwissFEL keeping the performance of the other beamlineunaltered. By producing a train of attosecond pulses based on a beatwave in theenergy spread modulation it can overcome some limitations of other methods,such as the strong space charge forces for ESASE operation and the frequentspatial realignment of a tilted electron bunch for fresh-bunch schemes.The proposal will finance a Ph.D. student, who will study and mitigate theeffect of the microbunching instability by primarily using the laser heater andoptimizing the bunch compression configuration. In addition, the laser heaterwill be used for slicing the electron bunch and controlling the FEL pulse lengthin a non-invasive manner. It might serve as an alternative cost-efficient methodfor a multi-stage fresh bunch technique for the proposed second hard X-raybeamline Porthos.",263172,2024,2028,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Unmasking the Remnants of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of Gravitational Wave Astronomy,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. The era of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy started on 2017 August 17, when LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) discovered an event dubbed GW170817. This was the very first direct observation of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star in-spiral, which was accompanied by the detection of light at all wavelengths. The multi-messenger observations of GW170817 have crucially informed a large variety of fields including gravitational physics, nuclear physics, cosmology, and relativistic astrophysics. In spite of the spectacular progress, several questions remain open. A key one is whether the stellar object leftover from the merger is a short-lived neutron star, a long-lived neutron star, or a promptly formed black hole. This award supports searches of LIGO data for signatures aimed at uncovering the nature of the merger remnant. Studying how the nature of the remnant depends on the properties of the merging objects can unlock the fundamental physics of matter at densities much larger than those that can be probed in Earth-based laboratories and clarify the physics of some of the most exotic objects in the stellar graveyard. This project also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will constitute the next generation of scientists, and several outreach activities aimed at presenting LIGO results to the general public and K12 students. Specific intellectual goals are: (i) Unmasking the remnants of compact object mergers accompanied by gamma-ray bursts by carrying out searches for gravitational waves from newly formed neutron stars; (ii) Assessing the efficiency of the newly-developed Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA) in detecting the full zoo of possible gravitational wave signals from merger remnants, and its efficacy in post-detection parameter estimation; (iii) Quantifying the potential for discovery of gravitational waves from neutron stars formed in long gamma-ray bursts by future upgraded gravitational wave detectors. Broader impact goals are: (i) Bringing age-appropriate presentations and LIGO-related outreach activities to under-represented groups by leveraging the TTU Honors College-Bayless Elementary School mentoring program; (ii) Presenting a LIGO prize to the South Plains Regional Science Fair; (iii) Presenting LIGO results to the general public during the Astronight at TTU.

Collaborative Research: A Matter of Timing: Star Formation Suppression Over the Last Half of Cosmic History,"This research team will study galaxies that just recently shut down their last burst of star formation, transforming from youthful active galaxies like our own Milky Way into sedate galaxies that age in place. While this process normally takes billions of years, the team has developed methods to find galaxies that experienced a rapid cutoff in star formation. The project will further develop these methods and use a wide set of data from telescopes around the world to understand why galaxies do (or don't) rapidly quench star formation. The program will support research experiences for undergraduate students at both Texas A&M University and the University of Colorado Boulder. Using novel modeling methods, the team has developed for large ground-based spectroscopic surveys, hundreds of massive galaxies that quenched their star formation within the last billion years have been discovered. The team will use an extensive multi-wavelength dataset for about 50 of these post-starburst galaxies to measure dust and cold gas masses, assess the incidence of active galactic nuclei, and measure obscured star formation. The team will also extend the selection methods to identify galaxies that quenched on slower timescales, which become increasingly prevalent at low redshifts. In addition, the team will expand existing research support programs for undergraduate students to include community building and skill-sharing exercises.

Renormalization and Rescaling in Conformal Dynamics,"The theory of dynamical systems describes how mathematical structures change over time according to prescribed constraints and laws. Dynamical systems model a host of complex phenomena, ranging from celestial mechanics to financial systems to human social behavior. An important but difficult question is to understand when small perturbations of the initial state of a system will qualitatively change the long-term behavior. The stability problem is frequently investigated through a rigorous study of the classifying space of all relevant dynamical systems, known as moduli space. This project focuses on a broad class of one-dimensional dynamical systems satisfying a geometric constraint known as conformality, along with the associated moduli spaces. Tools from complex analysis, hyperbolic geometry, and arithmetic geometry will be combined to address longstanding conjectures and to open new directions for investigation. The project will generate research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and will facilitate collaboration among early-career researchers via the organization of seminars and workshops. The research will also result in visually compelling representations, including intricate fractal images and videos, which will be shared with the broader public. Three distinct but interrelated directions lie at the core of this research project. First, the investigator will use recently developed techniques for the study of degenerations of rational maps and a priori renormalization bounds to study boundedness questions in conformal dynamics. These methods suggest promising approaches to tackle longstanding conjectures about the boundaries of hyperbolic components for rational maps. Next, the investigator will extend the correspondence between rational maps and Kleinian groups. This extension yields novel hybrid dynamical systems combining rational maps and Kleinian groups, where renormalization and rescaling methods can be used to understand rigidity and the deformation spaces. Finally, the investigator will pursue a recently developed renormalization theory for infinite circle packings. These new techniques hold promise in solving various conjectures regarding the quasiconformal geometry of circle packings, thereby addressing some open questions about uniformization and offering insights into conjectures from geometric group theory.

"Orbital Torus Imaging: Using element abundances to measure structure, orbits, mass, and dark matter in the Milky Way","The Milky Way is currently the only galaxy resolvable on a star-by-star basis with large statistical samples, making it the perfect testbed for exploring the structure of galaxies. Some of the pivotal open questions that still remain unanswered regarding galactic structure are: how much mass and dark matter do galaxies contain, and how is it spatially distributed? Under the assumption of a simple and time-invariant potential, many galactic dynamics techniques (e.g., Jeans or Schwarzchild models) infer the Milky Way's mass and dark matter content and distribution from stellar kinematic observations. These methods typically rely on parameterised potential models of the Milky Way and must take into account non-trivial survey selection effects, because they are making use of the density of stars in phase space. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys now supply information beyond kinematics in the form of precise stellar label measurements (especially element abundances). These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants, and in many cases can be measured without detailed knowledge of the stellar selection function, therefore making element abundance gradients less sensitive to selection function effects. This proposal aims to: 1) synergise the vast amount of spectro-astro-photometric Milky Way data from the Gaia satellite mission and large-scale spectroscopic surveys; 2) build on the Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) framework that uses element abundance gradients in phase space, and construct a data-driven generative model to measure the spatial, orbital, and mass distribution in the Milky Way; 3) use OTI to measure the amount of dark matter across the Milky Way; 4) use OTI to measure the amount of disequilibrium in the Milky Way. The results from this research programme will place constraints on current galaxy formation models.",260600,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
High-energy short-wavelength infrared soliton dynamics and sub-cycle strong-field physics,"Few-cycle laser pulses are indispensable tools for the observation of attosecond domain processes, and for exploiting intense light-matter interactions in physics, chemistry, or life sciences. Today, few-cycle pulse generation in the sub-cycle regime is dominated by
near-infrared lasers at wavelengths of 0.8 um. However, there is a strong application-driven demand for energetic sub-cycle
waveforms at longer wavelengths, in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1.4-3 um). Harnessing the advantageous wavelength
scaling of light-matter interactions, such pulses will open new avenues in strong-field science, ranging from relativistic particle acceleration to the generation of unprecedently short soft X-ray attosecond pulses.
I propose to substantially advance the current capabilities in strong-field science by obtaining the most energetic sub-cycle SWIR pulses generated to date. This main objective will be addressed based on soliton dynamics in gas-filled capillaries. In this approach, the temporal compression to the sub-cycle regime is achieved by carefully balancing nonlinearity and dispersion in the
waveguide. A key advantage of energy scaling this methodology in the SWIR arises from the significant growth of the waveguide dispersion with longer wavelength, reducing the necessary capillary length to table-top dimensions. Based on this, I will realise the first table-top, >mJ-energy sub-cycle SWIR laser. The source will then be used to study the generation of soft X-ray attosecond supercontinua surface harmonics at so far inaccessible driving parameters.
Achieving the objectives will require me to develop skills in high-energy laser physics, advanced numerical modelling, and project organisation. It is a perfect opportunity to combine my experimental background with the simulation competences at the host institution. The fellowship will not only accelerate my academic career but establish a novel laser class for the next generation of strong-field and atto-science.",260600,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Quark Matter in Neutron Star Mergers,"The existence and location of a first order phase transition from nuclear to deconfined quark matter are one of particle physics's most
exciting unanswered questions. With the discovery of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in 2017 from the LIGO
and VIRGO detectors, entirely new ways of investigating dense matter have emerged. Future third-generation gravitational-wave
detectors like the planned Einstein Telescope (ET) in Europe will be able to not only measure the inspiral but the actual merger of the
stars. Only by improving the microscopic physics implemented in numerical simulations, we will be able to decode and constrain the
governing forces of particle physics imprinted in the merger signal and unlock ET's full potential. This includes a proper treatment of
the microscopic physics of chemical equilibration and deconfinement in quark matter. In previous works, the effects of the weak
interaction have been ignored, which dismisses important effects like bulk viscosity and phase conversion dissipation. The aim of
QUARKSTAR is to investigate, compute and provide all the necessary microscopic physics for the proper treatment of quark matter in
mergers. The main focus is to provide the results in a way that they can be used by the merger community and implemented in future
simulations. This might open a completely new pathway to the discovery of quark matter in dense matter.
As an expert on microscopic physics, transport, and weak interaction processes in neutron star mergers, Dr. Alexander Haber will join
forces with the numerical general relativity group of Prof. Nils Andersson in Southampton. This ideal placement allows Dr. Haber to
receive all relevant training for his future academic career while presenting the ideal combination of knowledge from microscopic
physics to general relativity necessary to tackle the question of quark matter and deconfinement in neutron star mergers.",260599,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
AMPLEPHY - All-optical multi-photon highly enantioselective photochemistry,"Molecular chirality plays an important role in chemical reactivity, has direct implications throughout the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and is rapidly becoming an important asset for nanotechnology. But our ability to trigger different chemical reactions in the left and right enantiomers of a chiral molecule using light is extremely limited. The goal of this proposal is to leverage modern light sources to achieve potentially disruptive breakthroughs as well as to improve our fundamental understanding of highly enantioselective photochemistry. Multiphoton coherent control promises a plausible route towards this goal and pioneering experiments using microwaves to drive rotational transitions have taken important steps in this direction. But rotational excitations do not lead to the nuclear rearrangement required for photochemistry and the method cannot be scaled to liquid samples, where applications are most relevant. Thus, photochemistry requires replacing rotational transitions by electronic transitions, which in turn requries bridging a monumental gap in terms of energy scales and complexity, going from ~0.0001 eV to ~10 eV and from rigid rotors to complex multielectron polyatomic systems. Recent results show that this transition is far from trivial and taking into account variations of the field as a function of position is crucial. The first general objective of this proposal is to provide a theoretical demonstration of all- optical highly enantioselective photochemistry using realistic fields. The second general objective of this proposal is to explore the possibilities offered by approaching enantioselective photochemistry from the time-domain perspective (enantioselective charge migration) taking advantage of intense and ultrashort X-ray sources (XFELs).",260598,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Chemical Sciences; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Fitting Masses of Milky Way Satellites with Milkyway@home,"About 85% of the mass in the Universe is thought to be dark matter. Dark matter is theoretically made up of particles that have mass, but can pass right through ordinary matter, like the Earth. These particles are thought to exist because they are needed to explain the motions of stars and galaxies. These visible objects are moving as if being tugged by gravitational forces of some unseen masses. However, dark matter has never been directly detected. The investigator will observe small galaxies that are close to our own Milky Way galaxy to learn how accurately the dark matter in these small galaxies can be measured. This project supports a graduate student who will lead activities for the Flying Cloud Institute for Young Women in Science (YWIS). YWIS offers after-school science club laboratories and a summer camp for middle school girls who are interested in science. The investigator leads the MilkyWay@home project. In this project thousands of people volunteer their computers to help MilkyWay@home do research, and these citizens also follow the research developments. In addition, this project funds summer research experiences for three undergraduate students. This project aims to quantify the systematic errors in measurements of the dark matter mass of dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way from observations of tidal streams. When a smaller galaxy falls into the Milky Way, our galaxy’s gravitational tidal forces pull it apart and its stars are spread along its orbit into a long “stream” of stars. The key goal is to understand the amount of dark matter in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the largest of the small galaxies that orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. Another goal is to figure out how well we can determine the amount of dark matter in a small galaxy that used to orbit around the Milky Way, but now has been ripped apart by our Galaxy’s gravity. Now, the stars from this small galaxy are spread out across the sky. While both of these measurements of dark matter mass are surprising, the systematic errors in these measurements are not well known. By studying the relationship between the assumptions made and the measurements obtained, the investigator will determine the range of dark matter masses of these Milky Way satellites that is consistent with currently available data.

"Developing an Open Source, GPU-enabled Code for Multi-messenger Compact Mergers","Gravitational wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration are driving a surge in astronomical understanding and the advancement of science. This progress relies on continued theoretical and numerical work studying the mergers of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) which connects underlying physical processes to gravitational, electromagnetic, and neutrino observables. This award supports studies of the high energy disruption of neutron stars in such mergers with state-of-the-art neutrino transport via the development of an open-source code that leverages the tremendous computational power of GPU computing. This effort seeks to advance multimessenger science by developing an open-source, GPU-enabled, general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamics code with neutrino transport and using it to study binary neutron star and black hole--neutron star mergers. The demands on numerical solutions increase as observations progress: higher phase accuracy, longer simulations, multi-scale physics with magnetic and neutrino effects, and wider exploration of the large parameter space. To satisfy such demands, this award works to develop an open-source, state-of-the-art code to model compact object mergers with the full panoply of physics that runs on the power-efficient, large GPU-enabled supercomputers being built today and designed for tomorrow. Studies of BNS and BH-NS mergers will help build wave templates, steer designs and upgrades of future gravitational wave detectors, and extract science from LVK observations and those of future detectors. Such models may help direct the best observational resources with concurrent and coordinated searches among multi-messenger detectors. The work will help: constrain the nuclear equation of state, constrain fundamental physics, elucidate details about the source of r-process elements and the conditions needed for a kilonova, and improve understanding of the engine underlying sGRBs. This work will help to understand some of the most energetic and intriguing processes in the universe attracting interest from the wider public. This work will promote the training of students in STEM, including high school and undergraduate students.

Theoretical study and method development to electron/photon-induced chemical reaction and selectivity,"Controlling chemical reactions and selectivity is an enduring pursuit within the field of chemistry. Recent experiments conducted in molecular junctions, scanning tunneling microscopes, and polariton chemistry have explored the potential to modify chemical reaction rates and selectivity by manipulating the physical environment of molecules. However, the physicochemical processes responsible for the electron/photon-induced changes in reaction rates remain largely elusive. An accurate and systematic theoretical study of electron/photon-induced chemical reactions and selectivity is crucial not only to elucidate a wealth of intriguing experimental phenomena but also to advance our fundamental understanding of molecular reactivity and reaction selectivity.Despite its importance, achieving this understanding poses a significant challenge for current simulation methods due to the necessity for precise descriptions of anharmonic characteristics, intricate interactions between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, and the pivotal role of quantum dynamical effects. Therefore, the project's primary objective is to develop a theoretical framework capable of accurately and efficiently describing electron/photon-induced reactions. This involves optimizing the hierarchical equations of motion method (HEOM) and its integration with the tree tensor network state (TTNS) approach, as well as developing mixed quantum-classical methods that combine the HEOM+TTNS method with a series of cutting-edge quasi-classical approaches for different degrees of freedom. The methods developed in this project will provide an efficient tool for simulating molecular dynamics of large-scale complex systems and related fields.With this consistent theoretical framework that combines several state-of-the-art techniques, the second goal of the project is to conduct a systematic model study of these reactions. This involves progressively increasing complexity to address fundamental questions about reaction mechanisms, environmental influences, collective effects, and achieving reaction selectivity. The studies are expected to yield a deeper and more insightful understanding of the basic reaction mechanisms underlying electron/photon-induced chemical reactions.",259016,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
"Electronic, transport and topological properties of frustrated magnets","NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research on understanding quantum materials and phenomena related to frustrated magnetism, which refers to magnetic materials that have competing tendencies to assume different and mutually exclusive magnetic orders that lead to different macroscopic magnetic behavior. Additional complexity due to magnetic frustration makes theoretical and computational study of such materials rather challenging, and many interesting questions remain unanswered. Yet, for the same reason magnetically frustrated materials feature novel physical properties, which are of both fundamental and potential technological interest. This project is aimed at achieving new advances in conceptual understanding of the microscopic physics of such materials through a combined effort of theoretical physics and computational materials science approaches. The theoretical and computational research will proceed in close collaboration with experimental groups studying the same materials. This award also supports the PI's educational activities aimed at training undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral research associate in computational materials science. This training is expected to offer the students and postdoc an excellent opportunity to acquire knowledge in advanced electronic structure methods, state-of-the-art materials modeling techniques, and high-performance computing, which are essential for their future employment in academia or industry. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical research on understanding quantum materials and phenomena related to frustrated magnetism. Magnetic frustration lies at the core of the notion of skyrmions and quantum spin liquids, and more often than not also triggers promising topological properties: Weyl and Dirac points, topological Hall effect, quantized anomalous Hall effect, controllable magneto-optics, and others. This project concentrates on electronic, transport and topological properties of frustrated magnets, using methods of theoretical physics and computational materials science. The goal of this project is to gain microscopic, materials-oriented insight into several novel classes of quantum materials with frustrated magnetism, providing a conceptual framework for design, discovery and application of relevant materials. Analytical modeling and both first principles (density functional theory and beyond) and second-principles (such as Monte-Carlo simulations utilizing first-principles-derived Hamiltonians) calculations will be employed. The research will approach the field of frustrated magnetism from both materials direction and physical effects direction. As such, the project has a potential to transform our understanding of the interplay between electronic structure, electronic topology, chemistry, crystallography and complex magnetic patterns, with an ultimate goal of providing a theoretical framework for synthesizing materials that can shape future technology and quantum information science through the emergent phenomena these materials harbor, applicable for spintronics, dissipationless electronics and quantum computing. This award also supports the PI's educational activities aimed at training undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral research associate in computational materials science. This training is expected to offer the students and postdoc an excellent opportunity to acquire knowledge in advanced electronic structure methods, state-of-the-art materials modeling techniques, and high-performance computing, which are essential for their future employment in academia or industry.

Analytic Langlands Correspondence,"This is a project in the field of algebraic geometry with connections to number theory and string theory. Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects defined by polynomial equations, and related mathematical structures. Three research projects will be undertaken. In the main project the PI will provide a generalization of the theory of automorphic forms, which is an important classical area with roots in number theory. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. In more detail, the main project will contribute to the analytic Langlands correspondence for curves over local fields. The goal is to study the action of Hecke operators on a space of Schwartz densities associated with the moduli stack of bundles on curves over local fields, and to relate the associated eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to objects equipped with an action of the corresponding Galois group. As part of this project, the PI will prove results on the behavior of Schwartz densities on the stack of bundles near points corresponding to stable and very stable bundles. A second project is related to the geometry of stable supercurves. The PI will develop a rigorous foundation for integrating the superstring supermeasure of the moduli space of supercurves. The third project is motivated by the homological mirror symmetry for symmetric powers of punctured spheres: the PI will construct the actions of various mapping class groups on categories associated with toric resolutions of certain toric hypersurface singularities and will find a relation of this picture to Ozsvath-Szabo's categorical knot invariants.

New Approaches to Modeling and Searching for Physics Beyond the Standard Model,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Joshua Berger at Colorado State University. Dark matter is a form of matter that makes up roughly one quarter of the total energy of the universe, yet its properties remain a mystery. Developing an understanding of its nature would help understand the basic laws of the universe and the history that lead to the world as we see it today. In his research, Professor Berger will develop new models of dark matter and study avenues to testing these models, with the goal of ultimately developing a complete picture of dark matter’s role in the universe. His research places a particular emphasis on the potential of current and upcoming neutrino experiments, such as the massive Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) with facilities in both Illinois and South Dakota, to extend their current program to a search for dark matter. Another exciting direction that his work will explore is the potential of high-precision measurements of the properties of atoms to detect dark matter. His research will have significant broader impacts. Professor Berger will work with graduate students, providing training in computing and problem-solving skills that have a long history of value to both academic and non-academic work. He will also give public lectures on his research results and support his students in gaining experience communicating with the scientific and non-scientific public. He has a history of incorporating results from his research into his courses and will continue to do so. More technically, he will study the production and detection of new dark sector particles at fixed-target neutrino experiments such as the Short-Baseline Neutrino Experiments and DUNE. The high intensity beams of these experiments have been shown to have leading sensitivity to models such as Higgs portal scalars and Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). Professor Berger will explore further signals of dark sectors and dark matter at such experiments. He will also explore astrophysical sources of dark matter signals, including scenarios with boosted dark matter and macroscopic dark matter scenarios, at the large volume far detectors at DUNE and other long-baseline neutrino experiments. Beyond the work on dark matter at neutrino experiments, Professor Berger will explore new models for dark matter detection in high-precision studies of atomic properties. Ultralight dark matter has been shown to lead to potentially observable deviations in atomic physics measurements. This work will focus on developing strategies to explore new models and to extend the scope of prior searches. It will be performed in collaboration with the atomic physics group at Colorado State University. Professor Berger’s research extends into probes of particle physics in cosmology, including signals of new physics in measurements of gravitational wave spectra and development of new mechanisms of baryogenesis in early universe phase transitions.

Unlocking Cosmic Mysteries Through Theoretical Particle Physics Studies,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Peisi Huang at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. There has never been a more exciting time for particle physics and cosmology. Ongoing and forthcoming experimental efforts are transforming our understanding of fundamental physics. Despite the remarkable success of modern physics, many mysteries of the Universe suggest there is an entire realm of “new physics” that lies beyond our current understanding. Professor Huang's research aims to utilize current and future experimental probes to advance our understanding of new physics through theoretical studies. Specifically, Professor Huang will study black holes, the imbalance between matter and antimatter, and possible changes in the history of the Universe. As such, Professor Huang's research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The proposed research will provide training opportunities for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students. Professor Huang also aims to increase participation in STEM by making a special effort to involve women, other underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students. More technically, Professor Huang will first propose new formation mechanisms and probes for primordial black holes, which are hypothetical black holes formed right after the Big Bang. She will study formation mechanisms through first-order phase transitions. Second, Professor Huang will investigate the imbalance between matter and antimatter by suggesting possible mechanisms, such as models with sub-GeV singlets, that could have created this imbalance and identifying ways to test these theories experimentally. Third, Professor Huang will study potential modifications to the history of the Universe and their implications, including the role of dark matter, though a novel scenario where a dark sector particle couples to a scalar undergoing a strong first-order PT through higher-dimensional operators. This might lead to periods of so-called “early matter domination”.

New Physics Signatures in Cosmological Observations,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Savvas M. Koushiappas at Brown University. Despite exciting experimental progress over the last two decades, several problems remain and new ones have appeared with the increased precision of cosmological experiments. The nature of dark matter and dark energy remain elusive, the distribution of dark matter in halos may hint to physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and the search for quantum gravity remains an open question. New physics is necessitated to address these questions. The award bridges the gap between cosmology, particle physics, and astrophysics, and is in line with the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. The projects in this award have also significant broader impacts. Professor Koushiappas will involve graduate students in his research and provide critical training for junior scientists in a STEM field. In addition, he will present public lectures on contemporary topics in cosmology as well as develop new courses that stem from the results of this research. Under this award, Professor Koushiappas will explore the effects of ultra-light dark matter in the accumulation of angular momentum in galactic systems. Angular momentum in dark matter halos is built-up in the linear and quasi-linear regime from the coupling between the mass distribution of the dark matter halo and the mass distribution of the neighboring density fluctuation field. Ultra-light dark matter has a different mass distribution compared to cold dark matter. This award will explore the effects of ultra-light dark matter in the angular momentum content of dark matter halos, with the goal of using current and future observables as constraints on the nature of dark matter. In addition, this award will investigate new possible interactions between dark matter and collision-less particles (stars and black holes) in dark matter dominated systems. Furthermore, work under this award will search for imprints quantum and/or modified gravity on cosmological observations through the growth of structure.

"NSF-BSF: Semigroup Operator Algebras - Representations, Boundaries and Dynamics","This project seeks to advance understanding of semigroups within the framework of operator algebras, an area of mathematical analysis. The mathematical field of operator algebras originated in the pioneering work of Murray and von Neumann in the 1930s to develop mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics and has grown into a vital subarea of modern analysis, with connections to many other mathematical fields, including geometry, topology, mathematical physics, and algebra. Operator algebras and the theory of semigroups have enjoyed a fruitful dialogue since the 1990s. Semigroups are algebraic structures in which (like the real numbers) elements can be combined using algebraic operations, but which (unlike the real numbers) generally lack inverse operations. Due to this algebraic structure, semigroups are often useful in modeling “irreversible” phenomena, such as the time evolution of some physical systems, and have proven to be an essential tool across the mathematical sciences. This project will develop new theories and methods to study semigroups and their associated operator algebras through their representations, boundaries and dynamics. The project will also foster international collaboration, enhance the research culture at New Mexico State University, and provide training of graduate and undergraduate students with an emphasis on including students from underrepresented groups. This is a project funded jointly by the National Science Foundation’s Division of Mathematical Sciences, in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (NSF-MPS-DMS), and the Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the NSF and the BSF. This project concerns the interrelationships among several classes of semigroup representations and associated operator algebras and dynamics. Unlike groups whose representations are always unitary, semigroups have richer classes of representations as operators on Hilbert spaces. The first goal of this project is to develop a general theory of dilation of isometric covariant representations to characterize boundary representations, and thereby calculate the C*-envelope of universal non-self-adjoint semigroup operator algebras. The focus is on the class of non-Nica-amenable semigroups, whose representations remain highly mysterious. The second goal of this project is to study semigroups from a dynamical perspective, seeking to understand the properties of semigroup operator algebras from the properties of the underlying dynamics. In particular, this project aims to build a general framework to study two-sided semigroup actions, which is motivated by mathematical physics. This project will also investigate the dynamics of self-similar actions, which exhibits new phenomena that generalize many group dynamics. Finally, this project will investigate the representation theory of Artin semigroups, which is a rich class of semigroups with deep connections to various areas of mathematics. In addition to providing concrete examples, the study of Artin semigroups will also contribute to multivariable operator theory and non-commutative geometry.

"Scalar Curvature, Optimal Transport, and Geometric Inequalities","This project focuses on questions at the intersection of differential geometry and the theory of partial differential equations. Differential geometry uses techniques from calculus to understand the shape and curvature of surfaces. These ideas can be generalized to higher-dimensional manifolds. In particular, they provide the mathematical framework for the Einstein equations in general relativity, which link the matter density to the curvature of space-time. A major theme in differential geometry has been to study the interplay between the curvature and the large-scale properties of a manifold. To study these questions, various techniques have been developed, many of them based on partial differential equations. Examples include the minimal surface equation and the partial differential equations governing optimal mass transport. This project is aimed at understanding these partial differential equations. This is of significance within mathematics. There are also connections with general relativity. Moreover, ideas from optimal transport have found important applications in statistics and computer science. The project also includes a variety of mentoring and outreach activities. An important topic in geometry is to understand the geometric meaning of the scalar curvature. The PI recently obtained a new rigidity theorem for metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature on polytopes. The PI plans to extend that result to the more general setting of initial data sets satisfying the dominant energy condition. In another direction, the PI plans to work on geometric inequalities and optimal mass transport. On the one hand, the PI plans to use ideas from differential geometry and partial differential equations to study the behavior of optimal maps. On the other hand, the PI hopes to use ideas from optimal transport to prove new geometric inequalities. Ideas from optimal transport can be used to give elegant proofs of many classical inequalities, including the isoperimetric inequality and the sharp version of the Sobolev inequality. Moreover, the recent proof of the sharp isoperimetric inequality for minimal surfaces is inspired by optimal transport.

Frontiers in gravitational wave astronomy (FRoGW),"Gravitational waves (GWs) have changed the way we explore the cosmo. They have uncovered new types of astrophysical objects (black hole binaries, black hole-neutron star binaries), which we had imagined but never seen. Thanks to GWs, we are closer than ever before to understanding the state of matter in the densest stars, the fundamental nature of gravity, the structure of our Universe.

These advances, made in less then a decade with only two detectors, show GW astronomy's unique potential: the ability to probe gravity at its extreme and, at the same time, large-scale astrophysics.

The goal of this project is to exploit both of GW astronomy's strengths, delivering data analysis tools, analytic results and practical
strategies. On the fundamental side, the project will address burning questions about the final stage of the merging of two black
holes (the ""ringdown""). Thanks to recent advances in perturbation theory, it is finally possible to understand - beyond leading order - how black holes settle down after a merger. This project will help fill-in one of the few missing blocks in the understanding of our century-old theory of gravity. This, together with practical strategies to distinguish new physics from old-fashioned astrophysics, will be essential to exploit near future (2023+) and future (2030s) GW observations.

As an MSCA fellow, the applicant will receive crucial training in the fundamental aspects of gravity at the Nottingham Centre of
Gravity (University of Nottingham). The Centre, whose expertise spans gravity, particle physics and cosmology, will be the ideal
environment for this interdisciplinary project. The project's approach draws also from the applicant's expertise in theoretical physics
and astrophysics, data analysis and numerical methods. An academic secondment at Caltech will complete the multifaceted training
necessary for cutting-edge GW research, and will ensure the project's impact on key stakeholders, including current GW detectors.",253552,2024,2025,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences; Particle and High Energy Physics
van der Waals Heterostructures for Next-generation Hot Carrier Photovoltaics,"In contrast to the bulk semiconductors, spatially confined van der Waals (vdWs) layered materials possess strong Coulomb interaction, high exciton binding energy, reduced charge screening and low electron-phonon coupling, leading to a slower hot carrier (HC) cooling. Efficient direct interlayer HC transfer has been observed in vdWs heterostructures without phonon emission due to momentum conservation at K-point. In a graphene-based vdWs heterostructure, considerably high optical absorbance leads to the enhanced photocarrier density, which invokes the hot-phonon bottleneck effect, leading to prolonged HC cooling in graphene. The aforementioned advantages of suitably designed vdWs heterostructures are certainly advantageous for fabrication of efficient HC solar cells (HCSCs), restricting the ultrafast thermalization of HCs and exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit. In this work, low bandgap (~1-1.5 eV) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of various layer thicknesses (transition metal: Mo, W; chalcogenide: S, Se, Te) with high optical absorbance will be grown and integrated with graphene having ultraclean interface for the fabrication of HCSCs. HC dynamics including the type of HC, temperature, HC lifetime, and carrier multiplication will be investigated by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe the solar light driven HC photovoltaic characteristics. Optimized graphene/TMD vdWs heterostructures will be integrated with proper energy selective contacts (ESCs) and metal electrodes with appropriate work functions for the efficient HCs collection in HCSCs. The thickness of the ESCs will be tuned for the maximum HCs tunneling to the metal electrodes through the ESCs. Demonstration of HC-driven photovoltaics will be carried out by current-voltage (I-V) measurements with various energetic laser illuminations. Large area HCSCs will be realized with wafer-scale growth of vdWs materials and I-V measurements under solar simulator (1-SUN AM1.5).",253550,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; South Korea,United Kingdom,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
HUMBLE: Holography and Quantum Black Holes,"Understanding the structure of gravity at small distances has remained a lasting challenge in physics. In the absence of colliders able to directly probe the Planck scale, the theoretical study of black holes can offer essential clues about quantum gravity. The aim of this project is to provide a deep and quantitative understanding of the quantum nature of black holes by incorporating holography, supersymmetric localization and techniques from analytic number theory, alongside constructing new anti de Sitter (AdS) black holes in string and M-theory. In particular, it will provide a precision counting of the microstates responsible for the huge entropy of black holes in AdS spacetimes, where we have a non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity through holography. At completion, this action will contribute towards resolving long standing puzzles surrounding black holes (such as the information paradox) via a unitary quantum field theory, and uncover hidden features of a consistent theory of quantum gravity. The project is multidisciplinary, at the frontier between high energy theoretical physics, general relativity and mathematics. As such, it could also have an important impact on mathematics, including enumerative geometry and the theory of mock modular forms.",253547,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Quantum-limited super-resolution imaging,"Enhancing the resolution in imaging is crucial for many fields in science and technology but is always hampered by the diffraction
limit. Treating light fields as quantum systems, quantum information theory show that it is possible to fundamentally break the
diffraction limit by demultiplexing the optical field into different spatial modes. However, the way to approach the quantum limit for
full imaging remains unclear and it is challenging to realize quantum-limited super-resolution for truly microscopic objects. To tackle
this problem, the proposed research aims to: (1) identify the quantum resolution limit for full imaging; (2) develop a practical and
universal imaging method towards the quantum limit; (3) realize the prototype of quantum-limited far-field microscope. Through
comprehensive training on both research and transferable skills, this action will diversify the applicant's competences for academic
leadership.
The research will integrate multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches, combining (1) quantum tomography and statistical
analysis with Fisher information formalism, (2) spatial mode manipulation and detection of light, and (3) nano-optics/microscopy to
establish quantum estimation theory of full imaging, develop novel detection techniques, perform microscopic imaging and evaluate
its advantages over conventional imaging.
The 3 research objectives correspond to 3 progressive research work packages to ensure the success of the fellowship, together with
a variety of dissemination/exploitation plans to maximize the impact of the action. The proposed objectives, if successful, will result in
a revolutionary imaging technology with a potential to change the faces of all fields of science and technology that involve optical
imaging, ranging over astronomy, biology, medicine and nanotechnology, as well as optomechanical industry.",253547,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
LEAPS-MPS: Toward Extracting the Scattering Phase Shift from Integrated Correlation Functions of Two-Nucleon Interaction in LQCD,"One of the most important processes in nuclear physics is the scattering of protons and neutrons (collectively nucleons) off each other. NN scattering has been studied for decades in laboratories, however there are many such scattering processes that are inaccessible in laboratories. Nucleon interactions in neutron stars, heavy ions, dense matter and many astrophysical areas can’t be probed in labs and thus theoretical calculations are critical. The most reliable calculations come from Lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD). Unfortunately, these calculations have significant challenges resulting from signal to noise issues to discrepancies using different methods. The PI proposes to use a new robust tool for calculating these processes as an alternative to the usual method. Undergraduate students will be recruited and engaged in numerical simulation, data analysis and LQCD calculations of the simple two-pion system. This project will catalyze a computational science research and education network at Dakota State, will involve a training program for K-12 science teachers, especially from tribal high schools, and will also pilot a broadening participation program with regional Indigenous communities. Reliable calculations of two-nucleon scattering in LQCD are crucial in nuclear physics. The current methods use a two-step Lucsher formula method for calculating phase shifts of two-nucleon systems. The PI proposes to find a new method for this calculation by extracting phase shifts from integrated finite volume correlation functions at small Euclidean times. They will establish a relativistic coupled channel formalism in LQCD, perform analytical and numerical tests on the developed formalism by perturbation theory and study of lattice artifacts in a controlled environment and in collaboration with George Washington University colleagues will study two-pion scattering as a test of the method’s effectiveness and robustness. Four undergraduate students will be recruited and will participate in numerical simulation, data analysis and the two-pion studies. In addition, the PI will offer a weeklong computational science research and training program for K-12 science teachers from tribal high schools, will initiate a strategic partnership with high school teachers to promote STEM education among Native American students and recruit four tribal high school students to work closely with the PI. This project is jointly funded by LEAPS-MPS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

Imaging and Controlling Electronic Dynamics in Matter: from Isolated Atoms to Nanostructures,"Photoelectron emission is a fundamental light-matter interaction process. It occurs when light with an appropriate wavelength and intensity strikes a material object, interacts with the electrons in it, and gives some of them enough energy to eventually leave the material altogether. These emitted photoelectrons carry information about the dynamics of the process and the electronic properties of the target material. For more than a century, the measurement and analysis of their energy and momentum distribution has been one of the most prolific methods for determining the electronic structure of matter, importantly promoting the development of laser and detection technologies as well as accurate quantum-mechanical theoretical methods. Traditional energy-domain spectra image the sample's time-averaged internal electronic dynamics during the photoemission process, but do not resolve the ultrafast time-dependent electronic dynamics during the photoelectron-release process. The PI and graduate student’s theoretical modeling of time-resolved photoelectron emission from solid surfaces and plasmonic nanoparticles is motivated by extraordinary progress in ultrafast laser technology that enabled the generation of ultrashort light pulses and their accurate control and synchronization. These pulses allow for investigations of the electronic dynamics in isolated atoms and condensed matter systems with temporal resolution at the natural timescale of the electronic motion in matter and with atomic spatial resolution. In the same way as making a movie of a fast-moving object, such as a bullet in flight, requires the stroboscopic assembly of many frames, each constituting a momentary image of the object, time-domain spectroscopy is about to provide “electronic movies”, capable of displaying the motion of electrons in and their emission from matter with atomic spatiotemporal resolution. Attosecond (1 as = 10-18 seconds) time-resolved spectroscopy has led to impressive time-domain studies of ionization processes on isolated (gaseous) atoms and is anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of electronic properties of layered-semiconductor structures and nanoparticles. However, the physical interpretation of time-resolved photoemission spectra faces significant conceptual challenges and necessitates comprehensive theoretical investigations, even for simple atomic systems. For complex systems, such as plasmonic nanoparticles and solid surfaces, additional severe technical difficulties in describing the transiently photoexcited electronic dynamics must be overcome. The PI and graduate student’s work addresses these challenges. It focuses on the numerical modeling of time- and spatially resolved emission of electrons and the generation of up-converted high-harmonic (HH) radiation from adsorbate-covered metal surfaces and nanoparticles. It proceeds by developing and applying complementary quantum-mechanical methods, including numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, and physically more transparent semi-classical methods. It will assess the fidelity with which time- and emission-angle-resolved photoelectron and HH spectra can reveal information on (a) electronic forces and dynamics in solids and (b) non-homogenous nano-plasmonic electric-field enhancements of incident light pulses. These investigations will advance our understanding of (i) single-electron and collective electronic excitations and (ii) the dynamics of electrons and fields in layered semiconductors, adsorbate-covered surfaces, and nanoparticles. It thus promotes emerging technologies, such as light-wave computing, nano-catalysis, and artificial photosynthesis, thereby contributing to the development of novel computers and catalytic devices for securing our energy supply and preserving our environment.

LEAPS-MPS: Second Generation Kitaev Magnets - Development and Preliminary Characterization,"Non-technical abstract The field of quantum computing is currently very active because of the need to solve complex problems in fields like finance, medicine and climate. Those complex problems involve an enormous number of parameters that present-day computers and algorithms cannot handle, but quantum computers may. The first step towards this is to create a qubit – the basic building block of a quantum computer. One route to creating a qubit exploits the minimum-energy state of a particular type of solid, called a quantum spin liquid. This project investigates a new family of compounds generically known as Kitaev magnets to realize such a qubit, which has the advantage of being error-free. In addition, the education and research activities in this project introduces Hispanic high school and undergraduate students in El Paso region of Texas to the field of experimental physics, thereby developing capabilities at a minority Hispanic serving institution. Technical abstract The Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice of spin-half entities predicts a spin liquid ground state and the possibility of topological quantum computation. First generation Kitaev magnets were 4d/5d honeycombs with spin-orbit coupling being operative, wherein the primary ingredient is a bond-centered magnetic exchange. However, real compounds show non-spin liquid phases due to additional isotropic exchanges and disorder. Following the hypothesis that alkali size, coordination and valency can tune the magnetic exchange via anion-mediated superexchange, this project examines second generation Kitaev systems in A2M2TeO6 family (A = Na, Ag; M = Ni, Cu). To understand the microscopic features of the crystal/magnetic structures and chemical coordination of the proposed compounds, X-ray and neutron scattering studies will be undertaken. Comprehensive magnetic field- and temperature-dependent magnetic phase diagrams of the second generation Kitaev magnets will be compiled from the measured physical properties.

LEAPS-MPS: Light-matter-heat interactions with ultrafast thermal-radiation spectroscopy,"Nontechnical Description Understanding how light, matter, and heat interact at ultrafast speeds is crucial for a wide array of applications, such as solar cells and heat management. However, ultrafast optical techniques provide only partial insight into these interactions. This project seeks to delve deeper into the dynamics of heat transport and temperature changes by focusing on thermal radiation. All materials above absolute zero emit electromagnetic waves, a process also known as black body radiation. The PI will analyze transient changes in thermal-radiation spectra induced by femtosecond laser pulses on both semiconductors and metals, thereby yielding new insights into ultrafast thermodynamics. Moreover, this research extends to exploring light emission immediately following laser excitation from hot carriers that have not yet reached thermal equilibrium. If this excess heat can be harnessed, there are prospects for more efficient devices such as hot solar cells. Research findings from this project will be integrated into physics courses at the University of North Texas, a minority-serving institution. This will provide invaluable learning and training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, including those from historically underrepresented groups in STEM. The team will also create engaging planetarium shows to communicate their discoveries to a broader audience. Technical Description The primary research goal of this project is to investigate ultrafast light-matter-heat interactions through the lens of thermal radiation. To achieve this goal, the team intends to develop an innovative system capable of measuring thermal-radiation spectra with femtosecond time resolution, facilitating direct observation of these interactions at unprecedented speeds. Expanding upon this technological advancement, this research delves into a diverse range of materials, including semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide, as well as metals like gold and aluminum. Through systematic experimentation, the team seeks to unravel the complex thermodynamics occurring within these materials after laser excitation. Additionally, the investigation extends to exploring light emission from hot carriers that remain nonthermalized shortly after excitation, shedding light on a phenomenon of significant scientific interest. This project integrates both experimental and theoretical approaches within the principal investigator's laboratory, leveraging a multidisciplinary framework to advance our understanding of ultrafast light-matter-heat interactions. Anticipated outcomes include the achievement of femtosecond-scale measurements of thermal-radiation spectra, the development of robust methodologies for extracting refractive index and temperature profiles from thermal-radiation spectra, and the generation of novel insights into the radiation emitted by nonthermal hot carriers. This research project is poised to represent a substantial leap forward in our fundamental understanding of ultrafast light-matter-heat interactions. By elucidating the energy balance within thermodynamic systems and uncovering the intricacies of radiation from nonthermal hot carriers, this project promises to yield transformative contributions to the field of ultrafast optics, materials science, and thermal physics.

LEAPS-MPS: Controllable Disorder as a Path to Many-Body Entanglement in Quantum Magnets,"Non-technical Description: Quantum information technologies rely on quantum entanglement, or the intrinsic linking of one quantum object to another. An important research objective is to gain a fundamental understanding of many-body quantum entanglement involving large numbers of quantum objects. Certain magnetic materials known as geometrically frustrated magnets provide a valuable platform for this topic of study because they may exhibit many-body entanglement at low temperature. This project advances the search for promising quantum-entangled frustrated magnets through a systematic investigation of the role of atomic-scale disorder in promoting or hindering many-body entanglement. The results illuminate strategies for utilizing disorder to promote quantum-entangled ground states and contribute to a deeper understanding of many-body quantum entanglement in general. These research activities are integrated into education and outreach efforts including intensive undergraduate mentoring, summer research internships for diverse students, and a new organization called the Physics Breakfast Club that supports regional high-school physics teachers by building community and providing teaching resources. Technical Description: Recent work suggests that disorder in certain types of frustrated magnets can stabilize entangled magnetic states such as a quantum spin liquid. This project explores that idea in the context of rare-earth pyrochlore compounds with mixed atomic species on the nonmagnetic metal/metalloid site. The level of random disorder can be controlled by the size mismatch of the different atomic species, allowing a systematic investigation of the influence of disorder on the formation of a quantum spin liquid or a related phase in disordered pyrochlore compounds. The goals are to develop guiding principles for utilizing disorder as a tool for stabilizing entangled magnetic states and evaluate the potential of disordered pyrochlores for achieving these states. The magnetic and structural properties of the materials are characterized by state-of-the-art techniques including x-ray and neutron total scattering, muon spin spectroscopy, and inelastic neutron scattering. This multi-modal methodological approach is ideally suited to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the local disorder and its effect on the magnetism in pyrochlore compounds, while also providing a template for similar studies on other materials in the future.

LEAPS-MPS: Unveiling the Ultra-High-Energy Universe with the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND),"Most of our knowledge about the Universe comes from the observation of photons, including microwaves, X-rays and gamma rays. However for very large energies the Universe is not transparent. In order to study the highest energy phenomena, one must look at ultra high energy (UHE) neutrinos. They can address important questions such as the nature of dark matter, the possibility of new particles and interactions at energy scales beyond the Large Hadron Collider and new fundamental symmetries. The PI will join the GRAND (Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) observatory which has been proposed to study UHE neutrinos. When these neutrinos enter the atmosphere, they will interact and produce large particle showers that will emit radio signals. GRAND will detect these emissions with the most extensive array of radio antennas ever assembled. There are several projects in the proposal that will each have significant student participation and will be accessible to undergraduates as well as Masters students at a Hispanic-serving institution. The proposal consists of three projects for the GRAND observatory. This observatory has the potential to make major contributions to multi-messenger astronomy. It will detect much-awaited cosmogenic neutrinos and distinguish the contributions of newborn pulsars, AGNs, afterglows of gamma-ray bursts and galaxy clusters. The three projects will make ample use of modern Machine Learning techniques to develop software and various statistical tools for the detection and analysis of UHE neutrinos. They will implement a fast and accurate model parameter regression framework for the reconstruction of air showers using modern optimization algorithms, efficient disentangle real radio signals from background noise by configuring and training a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder and will use modern Machine Learning methods to build a fast and accurate emulator for radio emissions from extensive air showers. The project will establish a GRAND team at SF State and provide opportunities for students to participate in numerical modeling and lear research computing techniques. They will create programming tutorials and enhance the MasterClass program led by the PI.

LEAPS-MPS: Microwave Spectroscopy of Engineered Triplet Superconductors,"Non-Technical Description Superconductors are commonly defined as materials which support the flow of electrons (i.e. a charge current) without any resistance. Electrons carry a magnetic moment – from their spin – as well as a charge, so it is natural to ask whether magnetization currents or waves might also flow unimpeded through a superconductor. In the majority of superconductors, the answer is negative, since the spins in the electron pairs responsible for superconductivity are anti-aligned and no net spin transport can occur. However, theory predicts that electrons could also pair up in “spin-symmetric” configurations, creating unusual new superconducting states with unique applications in spin transport, quantum memory and topologically-protected quantum logic. Spin-symmetric superconductivity is challenging to achieve (usually being quenched by disorder or static magnetic ordering) and hard to unambiguously distinguish from conventional pairing. The goal of this work is to explore new methods for stabilizing spin-symmetric pairing in a range of atomically thin multilayers comprising superconductors, heavy metallic elements and magnetic materials. New experimental apparatus – a low-temperature microwave transmission/absorption spectrometer – is being built to detect long-range spin transport in these materials and hence facilitate identification of the exact pairing symmetry. Students trained within this project are ideally qualified to join the local workforce for the new quantum computing TechHub recently established in the Mountain West. The principal investigator is also strengthening links with a local Tribal-serving community college in Wyoming, by offering four summer research internships which explicitly target Native American undergraduates. Technical Description: Superconductivity is mediated by electron pairs, which possess antisymmetric (singlet) spins in the vast majority of cases. There is no fundamental barrier to spin-symmetric (triplet) pairing, but the conditions for its emergence are rarely satisfied in bulk materials. However, there is a growing recognition that two phenomena more familiar to spintronics researchers – chiral magnetism and spin-orbit coupling – may hold the keys to developing artificial multilayers which host stable spin-symmetric pairs. Achieving such control over the superconducting order parameter opens the door to topological superconductivity and/or dissipationless spin transport, with hotly-anticipated applications in quantum and classical information. Motivated by these targets, this project explores three distinct approaches to modify the pairing symmetry of ultra-thin film superconducting heterostructures grown by electron-beam evaporation: (1) Generating odd-frequency s-wave triplet pairs from spin-mixing and rotation in superconductor/non-collinear magnet hybrid multilayers; (2) Inducing chiral p-wave pairing by synthetic spin-orbit and Zeeman fields from a proximate magnetic skyrmion lattice; (3) Creating odd-parity triplet pairs via Rashba spin-orbit coupling and broken spatial inversion symmetry at superconducting heterointerfaces. These unconventional pairing states are distinguishable via microwave spectroscopic techniques, with the construction of a unique new broadband transmission/absorption probe a priority for the project. Enhanced spin-pumping and macroscopic spin transport allow inference of the presence of triplet pairing, while nodal odd-parity order parameters can be detected from the temperature-dependent superfluid density. Demonstrating the emergence and resilience of these exotic pairing symmetries in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling can accelerate their adoption by quantum technologies, especially in material platforms for topological quantum computing.

LEAPS-MPS: Searching for an Extended Higgs Sector at the Large Hadron Collider,"The Standard Model of particle physics describes the fundamental constituents of the universe and their interactions. One of the greatest scientific triumphs of this century was the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. This made the Standard Model complete and self-consistent. However, there remain several phenomena that the Standard Model does not explain, including dark matter, the existence of matter instead of antimatter, the huge disparity between the strength of the non-gravitational forces and that of gravity, etc. Many of these phenomena can be explained by extending the Standard Model and popular extensions involve additional Higgs bosons. The PI proposes to search for these additional Higgs bosons at the Large Hadron Collider as part of the ATLAS Collaboration. He has identified a particular signature that has not been thoroughly studied and proposes to do a complete analysis of this signature. The project is accessible to undergraduates and the PI will recruit several students to work on the computational aspects and travel to CERN to work with others in the collaboration. An important aspect of this Collaboration is the Open Data project, which releases data, simulation and analysis tools to the public, and the PI will work with undergraduates as well as local high school teachers to develop this material. His institution, CSU Stanislaus, is a Hispanic-serving institution which is largely first-generation and low-income. Many extensions of the Standard Model involve additional singlet or doublet scalar fields which then predict the existence of new scalar bosons similar to the Higgs boson and which might mix with the Standard Model Higgs. The PI proposes to search for a class of these scalars using data from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, focusing on resonant scalar production in the highly sensitive 2-bottom quark, 2- tau final state. The search will include developing selection criteria to separate signal from background, estimating background processes using data-driven techniques and developing machine-learning methods to reconstruct and identify the 2-tau signature arising from a resonance of an unknown mass. There are several distinct projects, including a signal Monte Carlo Simulation, signal Topology, Trigger Efficiency, Missing Mass Calculator and Signal Selection. Undergraduates will be able to play an active role in all of these projects. Although a search has been studied by the CMS Collaboration, it has not yet been done by ATLAS which might provide stronger limits (or a discovery). The project will be performed primarily by undergraduate students in collaboration with other members of the ATLAS Collaboration.

Pebble growth and drift across gaps carved by giant planets,"The intricate processes governing the birth of planets take place inside gaseous protoplanetary discs around young stars. When planets grow beyond Neptune in mass, their gravitational influence perturbs the gas density in their vicinity, creating pressure bumps or shallow gaps that effectively halts the inward drift of millimetre to centimetre-sized dust aggregates, often referred to as pebbles, from the outer reaches of the disc. Consequently, pebbles accumulate at these pressure bumps, creating dust rings observable through observatories such as ALMA. Classical numerical simulations of planet formation frequently assume a monodisperse pebble size distribution, contrary to revelations from prototoplanetary disc observations, where pebbles come in various sizes and compositions, influencing the dynamics of planet formation. The PLANETDISKOS project aims to develop a comprehensive model that considers grain size evolution and pebble filtration by gas giants, while accounting for variations in pebble composition and porosity. A novel methodology is proposed to model self-consistent grain size evolution and pebble filtration by gas giants. This approach promises to enhance our understanding of the prevalence of Super-Earths in the presence of outer Jupiter-like planets and the heavy element content of gas giants. Synthetic exoplanet simulations will be conducted, integrating compositional properties, to compare with observed exoplanet populations. Early results from my numerical simulations of pebble filtration demonstrate the potential to achieve the goals of the project. Working with a team of experts in planet formation and cosmochemistry at StarPlan, I will acquire the needed skill set to execute the PLANETDISKOS project, opening new avenues for advancing the theoretical framework of (exo)planet formation.",249802,2025,2027,European Commission,Denmark,EU,Space Sciences
Beyond the hydrodynamics horizon in the evolution of small and large colliding systems at colliders,"A hot expanding environment is produced in heavy-ion (e.g., lead-lead or gold-gold) collisions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The produced system expands and cools down, turning from a phase with liberated quarks and gluons, called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), to hadrons, detectable in the detectors. The QGP behaves like a nearly perfect fluid that can be modeled via relativistic hydrodynamics with the smallest observed shear and bulk viscosity over entropy density. In the course of the collective expansion, the degrees-of-freedom interaction develops correlation, reflected in the correlation among final hadrons. Models based on hydrodynamics successfully describe the observed correlations in the experiments.
 
Observing a similar correlation among final hadrons emitted from much smaller collision systems, e.g., proton-proton and proton-lead, has triggered debates about the nature of the collectivity in such scenarios. Studies show that the models based on hydrodynamics become less predictive in smaller system collisions. In these systems, one does not expect a thermalized medium, and a framework beyond hydrodynamics is required to explain the true underlying mechanism in collective expansion. 
 
The main objective of the current project is to prepare a computational tool in the form of an event generator based on the kinetic theory with isotropization time approximation. Among an extensive list of heavy-ion collective models, this event generator will be unique in explaining small systems that behave particle-like and large systems that act fluid-like in a single framework. The model can bridge the experimental measurements and theoretical studies to quantitatively analyze the fluid-like/particle-like nature of large and small system collisions.",249801,2024,2026,European Commission,Denmark; Norway,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Constellation optimization for continuous variable QKD,"In today's highly interconnected world, secure communication between distant parties is paramount. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, rooted in quantum mechanics, offer a promising solution to this challenge by ensuring the generation of secure keys with high data exchange rates. This project objectives seek to advance the state of secure data exchange by optimizing quantum state transmission within QKD protocols. Focusing on Continuous Variable QKD (CV-QKD), we aim to pioneer novel algorithms that not only bolster security but also enhance cryptographic system efficiency. By shaping constellations and fortifying security proofs, COCoVaQ provides imperative contributions for secure communication, safeguarding sensitive digital information.
Currently, state-of-the-art CV-QKD protocols lack the sophisticated tools developed within the scope of optical communication systems, such as adaptive methods for optimal constellation optimization, which enable the transmission of secret keys at a high rate. Additionally, existing security analyses of CV QKD protocols with practical, discrete modulation often overlook critical symmetry aspects of the transmission algorithms that are imperative to establish security against arbitrary attacks.
In response, our project endeavors to devise groundbreaking algorithms for constellation shaping and introduce symmetry properties to CV-QKD protocols employing discrete modulation with provable security. Notably, discrete modulation typically results in a substantial penalty on the resilience against attacks. With the aid of constellation optimization, this project aims at mitigating this penalty by between 10 and 20 orders of magnitude, ensuring a theoretically secure exchange of secret keys of high rate at long distances. Finally, COCoVaQ will showcase practical demonstrations of the entire system, bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications.",249800,2025,2027,European Commission,Denmark,EU,"Information and Computing Sciences; Cybersecurity and Privacy; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
LEAPS-MPS: Ultracold Atoms for Quantum Science,"While simple quantum systems have long been studied, there is increasing interest in quantum many-body systems, which play an increasingly important role in applied science and technology and in fields ranging from chemistry to cosmology. These states, in which many degrees of freedom are entangled, are prohibitive to simulate on classical computers. Ultracold atoms provide a powerful tool for simulating quantum many-body systems because they can be isolated from their environment, tuned over wide ranges and probed with high resolution. This proposal is to develop a new experimental platform for creating new quantum simulation of many-body spin systems which will simulate quantum magnetism. This will help understand how entanglement spreads in many-body interacting systems with applications in quantum metrology and quantum computing. The PI will train students for careers in quantum information science with summer research programs, will develop 3-2 engineering partnerships with emerging Quantum Engineering degree programs and will join ongoing outreach at Lewis & Clark and the Portland community. Quantum many-body systems have been very important in applied science and technology. They generally cannot be simulated on classical computers. The PI proposes to use ultracold atoms as a platform for quantum simulation since they can be isolated from the environment, tuned over wide ranges, and probed with great resolution There is particular interest in systems far from equilibrium since spintronics, quantum-enhanced metrology and quantum computing all occur far from equilibrium. The PI will develop a new experimental platform for creating new non-equilibrium quantum simulations of many-body spin systems. They will explore extensions to the quantum Heisenberg Model which will inform models of quantum magnetism. The PI will use Lithium 6. This is a good choice since it is one of the first neutral atoms to be laser-cooled to quantum degeneracy, it is naturally abundant and is one of the few stable fermionic alkali isotopes. Also, atomic interactions can be easily tuned using magnetic Feshbach resonances. The two isotopes of lithium have similar resonant frequencies and thus a single apparatus can produce quantum simulations of either fermionic or bosonic systems. The PI will use undergraduate researchers to make preliminary measurements of the spin properties of many-body quantum systems. He will broaden STEM participation with a multi-pronged approach – through mentored summer research opportunities, cultivating dual-degree 3-2 partnerships emphasizing QIS careers and ongoing outreach, including middle-school lessons and summer camps.

LEAPS-MPS: Ergodic Jacobi Matrices,"The study of quantum systems is fundamental in modern mathematical physics. This project aims to study the long-time behavior of quantum systems by building new bridges between direct and inverse approaches. The direct approach asks one to describe the attributes of a given system, while the inverse approach asks what systems may exhibit specified attributes. The project plans to support education and diversity though a summer school in mathematical physics, the supervision of undergraduate research, and the writing and publication of a graduate textbook on ergodic Schrödinger operators aimed at introducing graduate students to this field. This project addresses the spectral analysis of Schrödinger, Jacobi, and Dirac operators with coefficients obtained by continuously sampling along the orbits of an ergodic topological dynamical system. This framework includes many models of interest, such as crystals, quasicrystals, and disordered media. The project will study open questions related to the quantum evolution for such models as well as the structure of the spectrum for pseudo-random models, periodic operators on graphs, and aperiodic tilings.

Unlocking Space-Time Curvature in Numerical Simulations,"The possibility of a curved Universe (space being uniformly curved like a three-sphere, for example) is one of the most intriguing consequences of general relativity. While observations tell us that the radius of curvature in our Universe must certainly be extremely large, there is variable evidence that suggests it might just be detectable by geometrical probes of extremely large scales. A new wealth of such probes is expected from the next generation of galaxy surveys that map out the far reaches of space, steadily approaching the cosmological horizon which defines the largest scale we will ever be able to observe. The analysis of the upcoming data will be extremely challenging, and large computer models are an essential tool that helps scientists navigate the complexities of this task. In this project I want to develop new cosmological simulations of structure formation that provide a consistent treatment of spatial curvature, including the non-Euclidean geometry. This is a significant step beyond the common approaches that focus on the dynamical impact of curvature on small scales and neglect the geometrical effect that appears on very large scales. The simulations will be developed from an existing numerical framework that is entirely based on the principles of general relativity. They will allow a detailed modelling of structure formation in the presence of curvature, but also account for the way the structure is observed on the past light cone in this nontrivial geometry, paving the way for a robust determination of the radius of curvature from upcoming cosmological data. Any discovery of curvature would have truly profound implications about the origin and the nature of our Universe. But even besides this ontological question, the interplay between curvature, structure formation and dark energy offers a rich phenomenology that remains to be explored further, promising a better understanding of how gravity shapes the Universe we live in.",247624,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
LEAPS-MPS: Superfluid investigation of topological superconductor candidates at low millikelvin with controlled disorders,"Non-technical description: Fault-tolerant topological quantum information technology promises a breakthrough in the fidelity issue in various nano-scale quantum devices, and the Majorana fluid plays a central role in this research effort. While the Majorana fluid emerging in the nanodevices can be used to realize topological quantum technology, the nature of observed signatures in such devices remains controversial. This LEAPS-MPS project focuses on (i) investigating the single-crystal topological superconductor that intrinsically harbors the Majorana surface fluid and (ii) incorporating relevant quantum materials research into various education activities. In particular, the project team is investigating the fundamental properties of topological superconductor candidates by measurements of London penetration depth and the superfluid density down to near absolute zero, which provides key information for the mechanism of topological superconductivity. The research topics are directly incorporated into education by offering research opportunities to undergraduate students and various outreach activities for K-12 students. The PI collaborates with Missouri S&T’s Kummer Center for STEM Education to host summer STEM events for area students in underrepresented groups. The PI also promotes quantum materials research to undergraduate students in the historically minority-serving Lincoln University of Missouri. The PI expands the existing partnership with minority-serving institutions and organizations in Missouri by incorporating quantum materials research and quantum computing science into various education activities. The LEAPS-MPS project grows the Missouri S&T's influence on underrepresented groups to encourage their entry into STEM education and careers. Technical description: The elusive Majorana fluid emerges on certain surfaces of a bulk topological superconductor, and the symmetry of its superconducting energy gap determines the Majorana-harboring surface. While there are a number of topological superconductor candidates, the gap symmetry in the proposed topological superconductors remains controversial. In this project, the research team will synthesize single crystals of various topological superconductor candidates and employ a low-millikelvin radio-frequency self-oscillator technique to investigate the superconducting energy gap in proposed topological superconductor candidates. The ultimate goal of this project is to confirm and identify the topological superconducting phase in the proposed materials. The rf-technique is implemented in a commercial dilution refrigerator and determines the temperature- and field-dependent London penetration depth at low-millikelvin temperature ranges, from which the superfluid density is subsequently determined. The possible symmetry of the superconducting energy gap is deduced from the measured penetration depth. Potential ambiguity in the gap symmetry due to the presence of disorder in as-grown single crystal samples is eliminated by introducing controlled disorders with various irradiation methods including gamma-ray and neutron. The irradiation is performed at the research reactor at Missouri S&T. Successful completion of this project enables highly efficient and focused investigation of the Majorana fluid.

DeConstruct Stars: revealing the enigmatic mixing process in the radiative-convective boundary of stars using cutting-edge 3D numerical simulations,"Stars like our Sun are complex systems in which hydrogen fusion occurs in the radiative core, and heat is transported by convection in the outer part. The two most important regions in Sun-like stars are the optical surface and the transition region between the radiative core and the convective envelop, called the tachocline. The tachocline, which is believed to be responsible for generating stellar global magnetic fields (also related to the 11-year solar cycle), is a complicated region where the effect of rotation, magnetic field, diffusion of elements, and convective overshoot interplays. In this project, we will carry out global convection simulations that range from radiative interior to the lower atmosphere for the Sun and a few F-type stars using the state-of-the-art DISPATCH code. Our ab initio simulations will include complex physical processes such as rotation and magnetic fields and are free from approximations typically adopted in previous works. Based on these simulations, the applicant will quantitively study the problem of overshooting and gravity wave excitation near the tachocline, which are crucial for a better understanding of the solar modeling problem, the anomalous abundance of lithium in the Sun, and the cosmological lithium problem.",245448,2025,2027,European Commission,Norway,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Nonlocal integrable equations: blow-up phenomena and beyond,"I will carry out this fellowship at the University of Oslo, under the supervision of Professor Kenneth Karlsen at the Department of Mathematics.

The project is devoted to study existence and blow-up properties of the solutions of initial value problems (IVPs) for nonlocal nonlinear integrable PDEs. Nonlocal integrable equations were introduced by M. Ablowitz and Z. Musslimani in 2013 and have become a hot topic in the theory of integrable systems. By applying inverse scattering transform (IST) method it was shown that soliton solutions of nonlocal equations blow-up in isolated points in x,t plane. Therefore the natural question is to study the existence and blow-up properties of the general IVPs for such equations. To this end we will use the mixture of the IST method and PDE techniques. The former will be used for predicting the presence and the form of the blow-up of the solution, while the PDE approaches will be used for describing the blow-up of the solution of the general IVP and for finding a suitable concept of a weak solution, which exists even after the collapse.

Also by the IST method it was shown that apart from zeros, which correspond to solitons, the associated to the initial data spectral functions have the new type of singularities. These singularities correspond to the winding of the argument of the spectral function and play a significant role in long-time asymptotic behavior of the solutions ? they are responsible for a transition between qualitatively different asymptotic zones in x,t plane. It is a challenging open problem to describe analytically the nonlinear effects corresponding to these new singularities and in the framework of the project we are going to investigate this phenomena numerically.

The fellowship will allow me to expand my skills in PDE methods, which is different, but related to my present expertise field. Also it will enable me to become an established interdisciplinary researcher,
who could pursue top academic positions.",245447,2024,2026,European Commission,Norway,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics
QED factorization for eXclusive semi-leptonic B-meson decays,"Exclusive semi-leptonic B decays provide an important laboratory for measuring fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM), or to search for yet unknown particles and interactions. Various tensions between experimental measurements and SM predictions have been guiding the theoretical efforts over the past years.

To draw reliable conclusions from the anticipated experimental high-precision data for such decays in the coming years, requires a rigorous study of sub-leading corrections that have been neglected so far. With the proposed action, the researcher aims to investigate the impact of so-called structure-dependent electromagnetic corrections to kinematic distributions in semi-leptonic B decays, using modern Effective Field Theory and factorization methods.  

A systematic study of QED corrections along these lines is a relatively new field of research, and in certain cases revealed surprising enhancement mechanisms not captured in a pointlike-meson description. An analysis of these effects in semi-leptonic transitions at the differential level is ambitious, and phenomenologically interesting. Photon couplings between the charged leptons and the meson constituents might lead to enhanced effects in rates or angular distributions. Uncertainties from novel hadronic parameters must be added to ‘clean’ ratios with reduced hadronic uncertainties.

Conceptually, factorization is achieved using of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory and Heavy-Quark Effective Theory. The analysis of these decay amplitudes require modern sub-leading power techniques to deal with technical difficulties such as endpoint singularities.

The action is subdivided into four work-packages (WP): Factorization theorems for charged and neutral-current semi-leptonic transitions are derived in WP1 and WP2, respectively. Novel concepts regarding the treatment of endpoint-singularities are developed in WP3, and WP4 aims at a collinear-photon inclusive 'jet-like' treatment of electronic channels.",245318,2024,2026,European Commission,Switzerland,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Quasimaps to Nakajima Varieties,"Counting curves in a given space is a fundamental problem of enumerative geometry. The origin of this problem can be traced back to quantum physics, and especially string theory, where the curve counting provides transition amplitudes for elementary particles. In this project the PI will study this problem for spaces that arise as Nakajima quiver varieties. These spaces are equipped with internal symmetries encoded in representations of quantum loop groups. Thanks to these symmetries, the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties is extremely rich and connected with many areas of mathematics. A better understanding of the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties will lead to new results in representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory, combinatorics and theoretical physics. Many open questions in this field are suitable for graduate research projects and will provide ideal opportunities for students' rapid introduction to many advanced areas of contemporary mathematics. More specifically, this project will investigate and compute the generating functions of quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties with various boundary conditions, uncover new dualities between these functions, and prove open conjectures inspired by 3D-mirror symmetry. The project will also reveal new arithmetic properties of the generating functions via the analysis of quantum differential equations over p-adic fields. The main technical tools to be used include the (algebraic) geometry of quasimap moduli spaces, equivariant elliptic cohomology, representation theory of quantum loop groups, and integral representations of solutions of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.

LEAPS-MPS: Massive Binary Stellar Evolution in Early Universe Analogs,"Massive binary stars form some of the brightest X-ray sources in the universe. Multiwavelength observations are crucial for understanding the complex process of massive binary stellar evolution. This project will use archival multiwavelength observations of nearby low metallicity dwarf galaxies, similar to galaxies in the early universe, to identify and characterize populations of massive stellar binaries comprised of a black hole or neutron star and a massive star (high mass X-ray binaries; HMXBs). The project will also develop a near-peer mentoring program that connects first and second year undergraduate and new transfer students with more experienced undergraduate physics majors and masters students. Peer mentors will also serve as research mentors for a new research skills course that will be created for students in their first two years on campus who do not have prior coursework in computer programming and/or scientific research experience. Understanding the contribution of isolated binary evolution to the production rates of gravitational wave events in the early universe hinges upon understanding of the complex process of massive binary stellar evolution at low metallicity. The project will use archival X-ray and optical/ultraviolet data to identify and characterize ~40 high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in nearby low metallicity dwarf galaxies, which serve as analogs to galaxies in the early universe. SED-fitting of multi-band photometry will derive physical properties of the companion star candidates including their effective temperatures, luminosities, and radii. The age distribution for the HMXB candidates will be measured by using spatially resolved recent star formation history maps of the galaxies in the sample. This project will lay the groundwork for future observing campaigns to obtain optical spectroscopy for HMXB companion star candidates in nearby low metallicity dwarf galaxies. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",244369,2024,2026,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
Structure of simple amenable C*-algebras,"This project is focused on structural and classification problems of amenable operator algebras. The theory of operator algebras began in the 1930s with the goal of creating a mathematically rigorous foundation for Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics. In Heisenberg's work, observable physical quantities are represented by certain linear operators on Hilbert space (roughly, infinite matrices of complex numbers). One of the most famous results of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that the momentum and position of a particle cannot be known simultaneously. The mathematically rigorous version of this statement is that the operators P and Q which measure position and momentum do not commute, i.e., PQ and QP are not equal (there is, however, a precise formula relating P and Q). Operator algebras is the study of algebraic relations between collections of operators. Amenable C*-algebras form a particularly important class of operator algebras. A large-scale effort over the last several decades has shown that, under relatively mild (though still somewhat mysterious) additional hypotheses, the simple (i.e., indecomposable) amenable C*-algebras can be completely classified. The main goals of this project are to further examine the extra conditions needed for classification, with a view toward more powerful classification results, and to study of the finer structure of the classifiable operator algebras, including their symmetries. The project will also enhance the mathematics workforce through research opportunities for graduate students, instructional workshops and seminars, and expository material on the main topics of research. Recent progress in Elliott's Program has shown that separable, simple, nuclear, Z-stable C*-algebras in the UCT class are classified up to isomorphism via their operator K-theory groups, their trace simplex, and the pairing between them. The Z-stability condition is known to be necessary and is currently the most difficult hypothesis to verify in practice. The Toms-Winter conjecture predicts that under the other hypothesis, Z-stability follows from an a priori weaker condition known as strict comparison. Part of the goal of the project is to examine this conjecture. It is a long-standing open question if every separable nuclear C*-algebra satisfies the UCT. While the UCT condition is usually easily verified in concrete examples (through a series of deep results in operator K-theory), the UCT continues to be a significant theoretical barrier. This project will examine the possibility of obtaining classification results without a UCT assumption, at the expense of augmenting the Elliott invariant with KK-theoretic data. Such classification results without the UCT will be crucial in advancing the structure and classification theory of non-simple nuclear C*-algebras and of group actions on (simple) nuclear C*-algebras. Indeed, all prior works in this direction suggests that variants of KK-theory accounting for the ideal structure and/or the group action on the C*-algebra will be necessary, and even in most concrete examples, there are no satisfactory analogues of the UCT which account for this extra structure on KK-theory. It will thus be necessary to work with KK-theory more directly than has been done previously in the (stably finite) classification theory. Progress in this direction will set the stage for the next stages in the structure and classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras and group actions on such C*-algebras. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",243580,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
iPMS - Impacts Probing Martian Subsurface,"Characterizing the shallow subsurface of Mars remains a challenge due to the existence of a sensing gap at the depths of meters. iPMS will close this gap by utilizing the fact that the surface of Mars is continuously bombarded by meteoroids which excavate material from those depths. The theoretical foundations of impact cratering indicate that the spatial distributions of ejecta are sensitive to the material properties. As over 1000 fresh impact craters and ejecta formed in the period of spacecraft observation were imaged with the highest resolution camera orbiting Mars (NASA MRO HiRISE), I propose to study these sites in theory and in reality in order to i) establish how ejecta spatial distributions vary with latitude, elevation and terrain types, ii) describe the theoretical dependency of these distributions on subsurface rheology and impact conditions, iii) constrain the subsurface rheology near selected impact sites, including human-made ones formed via controlled release of ballasts by spacecraft. This will be achieved by performing 1) analysis of ejecta in HiRISE images, 2) numerical impact experiments into a variety of layered subsurface targets with shock physics code iSALE. By combining the two approaches, I will tackle some key unanswered scientific questions in planetary science outlined by Decadal Survey 2023-2032. This project contributes to the bigger challenges of mapping water ice on Mars, is relevant for planetary protection, and will reinforce Europe's leadership and autonomy in space sciences.",243160,2025,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; United States,United Kingdom,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
TopROCS: Topologically protected chiral sensing,"Chiral molecules of opposite handedness are indistinguishable when they interact with a mirror-symmetric object, but have
dramatically different responses when they interact with another chiral object. Chiral sensing methods are of paramount importance
in fundamental science, from chemistry to biology and physics, as well as in industrial sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry.
Amongst these methods, all-optical ones like optical rotation are well established and easy to use, but are limited by very low signals
and are also affected by experimental noise.
In this project, I aim to develop the theory for new all-optical chiral sensing methods that are highly efficient, highly sensitive and
robust against noise. To achieve efficiency and sensitivity, I will use synthetic chiral light (SCL), a new type of light that produces
unprecedently strong enantiosensitive signals by encoding its handedness in the temporal evolution of the electric-field vector of the
light. To provide noise robustness, I will extend the concept of SCL and create chiral topological light (CTL), that is, SCL with a spatial
distribution of handedness with non-trivial topological properties. By transferring the CTL topology onto the molecular response, I
will enable the observation of novel chiral observables that are robust against noise owing to their topological nature. Additionally, I
will use SCL to modulate the coupling toward the environment of an ensemble of chiral molecules, inducing exceptional points (EPs)
and harnessing EP-related effects such as topological population transfer in an enantiosensitive way. Finally, I will devise a sensor for
chiral detection based on optical fibres that will be tuned to an EP and interact with a surrounding medium via SCL, paving the way
for a new generation of chiral sensors.",243160,2025,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Novel approaches for fundamental low energy neutrino physics in liquid scintillators,"Liquid scintillators have been a key technology in the field of neutrino physics for decades. They are especially well suited for the detection of low energy neutrinos due to their high light yield and proportional response particle energy, cost effectiveness, high purity, and volume versatility. However, liquid scintillator detectors have poorer position and energy vertex resolutions, and lower capabilities for particle identification, when compared with other technologies. In order to allow for new discoveries in neutrino physics, such as searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay or the measurement of low-energy solar neutrinos, it is imperative to evolve the liquid scintillator technology and find novel ways to deal with its current drawbacks. This proposal aims to advance the state-of-the-art of liquid scintillator detectors through the development of creative particle identification analysis methods and innovative liquid scintillator R&D. The developed methods will be used to improve and strengthen the low-energy neutrino analyses in SNO+, a leading liquid scintillator experiment located 2 km underground at SNOLAB, Canada. I will demonstrate an analysis framework capable of retrieving directional and particle type information from the scintillation light time profile, and use it to perform pioneering low-energy measurements of 8-B solar neutrinos. Secondly, I will lead liquid scintillator prototype work aimed at establishing higher isotope loadings as feasible options for future neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, including future phases of SNO+, while also exploring new and practical detector designs using simulations. With the proposed work, I will be able to devise a strategy to significantly advance the technological development of future liquid scintillator detectors, improving the sensitivity of instruments and opening up important new areas of application, providing a valuable guide for the future efforts of the neutrino physics community.",243160,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
QUIQ: Quantum information processed at attosecond timescale in double quantum-dot qubits,"In the realm of quantum information technology (QIT), scalable qubit platforms with long coherence times and high-fidelity gates are
essential for achieving quantum computational power. The project 'QUIQ' aims to explore the potential of double quantum dot
(DQD) qubits controlled at attosecond timescales by combining QD quantum information process modeling expertise with the
attosecond physics expertise of the attosecond quantum physics group at King's College London (KCL). By operating DQD qubits at
attosecond timescales, we can significantly reduce processing time and enhance performance in ultrafast QIT. The project focuses on
studying the coherence of DQD qubits through the implementation of Rabi oscillations triggered by ultrafast laser fields. We aim to
realize atto-qgates, representing the first attosecond quantum gates. The achievement of basic atto-qgates, including Pauli X, Y, Z,
and Hadamard gates, will provide a crucial stepping stone towards future attosecond quantum operations on DQD qubits.
Furthermore, we will investigate quantum circuit design and develop quantum error correction techniques to minimize errors in the
DQD qubit platform. The project combines theoretical investigations with the experimental capabilities of the KCL host group to
optimize system parameters, improve coherence times, and enhance control over the proposed DQD qubit platform. Additionally, we
will investigate quantum resources, such as entanglement and discord-like correlations, in bipartite DQD qubits. By proposing the use
of the quantum path interferometric technique based on High Harmonic Generation (HHG) for atto-qgate readout, this project
bridges the fields of attosecond physics and quantum technology, enabling significant advancements in attosecond quantum
information processing.",243160,2025,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; Italy,United Kingdom,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Classical spinning black holes from quantum spinning particles,"The first direct detection of Gravitational Waves generated by the encounter and merger of two black holes was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in 2015. Since this discovery, several other events which also include neutron stars have been observed. This opens a new path to explore the Universe and the limits of General Relativity.
The analysis of these events requires precise prediction for the waveform signal templates at the interferometer, which are obtained
by a combination of different methods to attain a good theoretical prediction of the three phases of a binary merger: the inspiral, merger, and ringdown.
In the past years, motivated by the discovery of Gravitational Waves, new efficient ways to produce predictions to model the binary inspiral have emerged. 
In contrast with traditional methods, these approaches are based on quantum field theory methods. 
The success of this effort borrows years of development in tools from precision physics for colliders. Such tools include new variables, multiloop calculations, and a formalism to obtain classical observables from quantum scattering amplitudes.
In this project, we aim to push the state-of-the-art in the description of spinning generic compact bodies (e.g. black holes and neutron stars), including non-conservative and absorption effects, in order to understand quantum-to-classical transitions with scattering amplitudes. 
We are going to progress in combining tools to efficiently go to higher-loop order in the conservative and nonconservative effects relevant to gravitational wave experiments. In this endeavor, we plan to explore relations and conjectures emerging from quantum-to-classical transitions.",243159,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Relativistic effects in Quantum Thermodynamics,"Quantum thermodynamics investigates the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, paving the way for innovative nanoscale thermal machines. Quantum thermal machines are poised to play an important role in the ""second quantum revolution"", which is brought about by the advent of quantum technologies that rely on the features of quantum superposition and entanglement. Developing thermal devices that harness quantum features to improve their performance beyond classical counterparts is one of the main objectives of quantum thermodynamics. Crucially, as the success of quantum technologies depends on our ability to monitor and control low-temperature systems, developing more precise low-temperature thermometry becomes important. On the other hand, at the fundamental level, our world is characterized not only by quantum features but also adheres to the principles of relativity. While relativistic effects, such as the motion of physical systems and spacetime curvature, have been shown to improve quantum information processes, their implications for quantum thermodynamics are largely unexplored. In the ReQuT project, we seek to leverage the principles of relativity and quantum thermodynamics to enhance the efficiency of quantum heat engines and develop high-precision quantum thermometers. Ultimately, ReQuT will generate foundational breakthrough progress in the development of a relativistic quantum thermodynamics theory, which so far remains a matter of controversy. To accomplish its ambitious goals, ReQuT adopts a highly interdisciplinary approach and has devised a well-rounded work plan, as well as detailed dissemination and communication strategies. The project will be integrated into the Quantum Matter Research Group at Newcastle University's School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, part of the Joint Quantum Centre Durham-Newcastle.",243159,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; Greece,United Kingdom,Quantum Physics
Invariants in derived analytic and noncommutative geometry.,"Recent work on the foundations of functional analysis has enabled the use of tools from homotopy theory to develop a unified approach towards derived and noncommutative geometry, expressing (derived) algebraic and analytic geometry as special cases. Derived geometry studies schemes and algebraic stacks in the algebraic case, and analytic spaces and stacks over a base Banach ring in the analytic setting. The way these geometric objects are often studied is through invariants of noncommutative algebras 
 or categories of such algebras) that are naturally associated to them. The most fundamental such noncommutative invariant is algebraic K-theory, which is the so-called universal localising invariant. Algebraic K-theory is however hard to compute as it lacks an important property called excision, and can therefore only be approximated by cyclic homology and its variants.

In this project, we will study K-theory and its approximations in the context of analytic and noncommutative geometry - both of which can be studied using the framework of bornologies, following the work of Ben-Bassat, Kremnizer and Meyer. More concretely, we will use the recently discovered continuous K-theory by Efimov to define a version of infinitesimal K-theory for bornological algebras and show that it measures the obstruction to excision in algebraic K-theory and negative cyclic homology, thereby extending a landmark result to the analytic setting.

Opposite to K-theory is periodic cyclic homology, which satisfies several desirable properties when one works over a base field of characteristic zero. In positive characteristic, however, periodic cyclic homology is badly behaved. A recently developed invariant called analytic cyclic homology corrects its defects. In the second part of the proposal, we will show that this theory coincides with periodic cyclic homology for suitable rigid analytic spaces and nonarchimedean completed group algebras for hyperbolic and reductive p-adic groups.",243159,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
SPACE: The Semiclassical Paradigm Applied In Cosmology And Black Hole Evaporation,"The proposed research project aims to provide a new theoretical framework for the interplay between quantum matter and gravity in
three physically interesting cases: black hole evaporation, the late time evolution of our Universe and the theory of cosmological
perturbations. The seminal work by Hawking showed that black holes are not perfectly absorbing, but can emit thermal radiation
when quantum matter is involved, thus losing mass over time. To date, a full model of evaporation is absent for four dimensional
spherically symmetric black holes.
In the cosmological scenario, it is expected that the evolution of the inflationary Universe was influenced by primordial quantum
fields. However, a formulation of cosmological perturbations which encompass the backreaction of the quantum fields on the
spacetime geometry have not been developed yet.
The goal of the project is to study these topics using the Semiclassical Einstein Equations and Quantum Energy Inequalities in the
realm of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes. The first part of the project aims to develop a new model of evaporation for
four dimensional, spherical black holes and massive, quantum scalar fields, with applications in physical models of gravitational
collapses (e.g., Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse). The second part of the project will investigate the form and the stability of global
solutions of the Semiclassical Einstein Equations in cosmological spacetimes, under the influence of a single massive scalar field (the
""inflaton field""). It will incorporate the backreaction of the quantised perturbations on cosmological spacetimes for the first time. The
mathematical expertise of the researcher in derivation of solutions of the Semiclassical Einstein Equations and the supervisor's in
Quantum Energy Inequalities is fundamental to the success of the project. Its completion will bring the most complete semiclassical
descriptions of black hole evaporation and cosmological perturbations known",243159,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Quantum Physics
SNSCHEs: Mathematical analysis of binary fluid mixtures,"A good understanding of fluid mechanics models is essential in many applied fields, ranging from aerodynamics to meteorology. In this project, we will concentrate on two mathematical models arising from the diffuse interface theory, and we will study their long-time behavior in a setting that should correspond better to physical reality than the results available in contemporary literature. 
 
The first model, called the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations (NSCHEs), describes more accurately the flow of two viscous incompressible Newtonian fluids with different densities and viscosities. The second model pertains to two-phase complex fluids with quadratic anchoring in Soft Matter Physics. It can be viewed as a generalization of the NSCHEs for an immiscible mixture of nematic liquid crystal fluid immersed in a viscous fluid matrix. 
 
Regarding the research proposed in this project, our focus is on the well-posedness and the existence of invariant measures and the large deviations principle for stochastic NSCHEs. These equations involve gradient-dependent noise and white noise affecting the NSEs and the CHEs separately. Particularly, we plan to study two concepts in the theory of randomly perturbed dynamical systems: the quasipotential and the action functional. These concepts play an important role in the theory of small perturbations of dynamical systems and in the analysis of transitions between equilibria. 
 
Moreover, this project primarily involves mathematical analysis for a model of two-phase complex fluids with quadratic anchoring proposed in this proposal, not in the numerical sense as in the literature. Therefore, our starting point for studying this model of two-phase complex fluids is to establish good solution theories both in the deterministic and the stochastic cases. Such theories will then enable us to explore various qualitative features of the solutions and will pave the way for studying other related equations that are currently beyond our grasp.",243159,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
FusMat - Tungsten-based high entropy alloys for fusion energy,"This project will develop advanced plasma-facing materials that may enable improvements in the efficiency and operating lifetime of future energy-producing fusion reactors. Such energy-demonstrating reactors may include the European Demonstration Power Plant (EU-DEMO) and the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (UK STEP). In all fusion tokamak configurations, the plasma-facing material (PFM) is exposed to an intense flux of particles of deuterium, tritium, helium and neutrons, which will degrade its performance. This leads to contamination of the reactor and consequently limit the reactor's operation. Baseline tungsten PFMs have already been identified for experimental (i.e. non-electricity producing) reactors, but the development of advanced tungsten-based alloys with improved thermal-mechanical performance and irradiation damage tolerance remains a vital concern for the future. 
In this research, I will develop a fundamental understanding of how W-based high entropy alloys (HEAs) degrade in extreme fusion reactor environments. Recently, these alloys have been proposed as having unrivalled resistance to neutron fluxes. However, to date their thermophysical properties and plasma-facing performance remain poorly understood. 
The goal of this work is the development of advanced tungsten-based HEAs via two interlinked work-packages: First, I will process new W-based HEAs and study their fundamental thermal and mechanical properties. Second, I will study their behaviour under fusion relevant plasma conditions including fluxes of heavy ions and hydrogen. By interlinking the microstructure, the fundamental materials properties, and the damage tolerance, my project will guide the development of materials with improved performance that are vital for commercial reactor operation.",243159,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Advancing the theory of electron excitation induced by atomic motion at surfaces.,"Adsorption of atoms and molecules on surfaces is of central importance to many processes in nature and industry, like cloud formation, heterogeneous catalysis, or thin-film growth. From a simple perspective, an incoming particle must transfer enough of its excess energy to the substrate or otherwise it will recoil. Experiments on hyperthermal H atom scattering from surfaces of the three major material classes - insulators, metals, and semiconductors - have been performed to study how much energy is transferred during the H atom's collision with the surface. It was found that the effectiveness of the energy transfer strongly depends on the nature of the underlying substrate. So far, the energy transfer between H atom and surface could only be modelled with frameworks that were specifically designed for the nature of the underlying material, but a universal method that is capable to describe the energy transfer between high-energetic atom with an arbitrary surface is yet lacking. 

The aim of this fellowship is to design a new simulation tool that can describe energy transfer between H atoms and the surfaces of the three major material classes. Combined with electronic structure methods and machine learning, we will extend a mixed quantum-classical surface hopping dynamics approach that has been used earlier for NO scattering from Au(111) to make it generally applicable to any material surface. Firstly, we will apply this new methodology to scattering dynamics on simple, analytic 1D-Hamiltonians describing different materials. Subsequently, we will develop a full-dimensional machine learning potential for H atoms at clean, H- and Li-covered Ge(111) to study the role of the electronic, and phononic effects as well as of the different surface binding sites on the energy transfer. The acquired knowledge will enable us to engineer surface modifications that control energy transfer processes, relevant to improve fusion reactor containment and radiation protection",243159,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Multifield tuning of spin crystal ferroelectrics,"Topological structures in ferroic materials have garnered immense interest in recent years for their richness in condensed-matter physics as well as potential applications for future low-power ultra-high density nanoelectronics. Ferromagnetic topological spin structures (e.g., vortices and skyrmions), driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), are promising for next-generation spintronic devices due to their small size as well as energy-efficient and current-driven behaviour. In comparison with ferromagnetics, ferroelectric materials are more structurally anisotropic and therefore should host smaller topological structures as indicated by the much smaller internal characteristic length scale (domain wall width being ~1/10 of that in ferromagnetics). However, complex ferroelectric topologies triggered by the electric DMI have not been discovered until recently in a spin crystal ferroelectric system-(SrRuO3)m/(PbTiO3)n/(SrRuO3)m. In order to further harness the potential of spin crystal ferroelectrics for next-generation nanoelectronics, the structural and polarization dynamics of the topological structures under external stimuli, e.g., electric, optical, and mechanical excitations, merit detailed studies. In this proposal, we plan to use time-resolved synchrotron x-ray diffraction in combination with scanning probe microscopy to examine how the unique ferroelectric topological structures will be perturbed by external excitations and the possible deterministic interconversion among different topological states. Additionally, with the help of theoretical calculations, we aim to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying physics. Such studies will provide further evidence for the potential of ferroelectric systems to mimic their magnetic counterpart, further extending their application prospects.",243159,2025,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Condensed Matter Physics
Non-Hermitian Physics in Ultracold Atoms and Photonics,"Quantum and optical technologies are emerging as two major research frontiers that could potentially revolutionize computing, communication, security, measurement, and sensing for modern science and engineering. A common foundation for these technologies is that part of the underlying quantum equation, the Hamiltonian, that governs the internal phases and dynamics of the physical system. A quantum Hamiltonian that describes the unitary time-evolution of real physical observables is said to be Hermitian (named after the mathematician Charles Hermite). This work explores the dynamics of systems described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in exploring non-Hermitian physics in classical photonic systems. Advances in classical systems naturally suggest extending the studies to quantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, which possess major ingredients that are lacking in classical photonics. This project investigates the non-Hermitian physics in both classical photonics and ultracold atoms and explores their device applications. The proposed research will not only pave the way for non-Hermitian control of photonic and ultracold atomic systems for many important applications, but also influence fundamental research in optical and cold atom physics. The project provides a diverse platform for both graduate and undergraduate students to explore theoretical cold atomic, optical and condensed matter physics. The scope of this project also includes specific outreach activities for K-12 students and involving students from under-represented groups, such as women and minority students, for broadening participation. The overall objective of the proposal is to investigate the non-Hermitian driven topological physics in classical photonics and non-Hermitian quantum physics in ultracold atoms. Specific projects include: i) construction and characterization of new topological photonic lattices (e.g., fractal and 3D higher-order topological insulator) through Hermitian and non-Hermitian control; ii) study of novel topological phases (e.g. coupled edge states facilitated topological photonic lattice) arising from unique continuous hyperbolic metamaterials; iii) generation and control of non-Hermitian ultracold atomic matters utilizing their quantum, interacting, or fermionic properties. A diverse set of physical problems and systems will be investigated using versatile analytic and numerical tools (e.g., mean field theory, non-Hermitian density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm, etc.). The proposed projects will not only lead to the experimental advances for exploring non-Hermitian matter, but also provide platforms for developing novel photonic and quantum technologies.

From Quantum Many-body Dynamics to Fluid Equations and Back,"The analysis, simulation, & applications of the nonlinear fluid equations like the Euler equations or the Navier-Stokes equations, is an important (if not a vital) part of many areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The research in this project concerns a variety of projects on the rigorous derivations of these macroscopic continuum equations from basic microscopic quantum particle models and elucidates how the macroscopic fluid-defining quantities like pressure or viscosity emerge from the averaging of microscopic quantities. Examples of the boson particles we study includes the nitrogen and oxygen molecules (99.03% volume of air) and 99.95% of the water molecules. The number of particles in these many-body systems is on the order of magnitude of the Avogadro constant, which make the microscopic simulation of such systems impossible. The mathematical justification of these macroscopic continuum limits for the many-body systems they are supposed to describe, is therefore an issue of fundamental scientific importance. The principal investigator is committed to introducing undergraduate and graduate students to experiments and cutting-edge mathematics, advising PhD students and mentoring postdoctoral researchers. The particular scope of this research project is to investigate several problems concerning the fine properties of solutions to the time-dependent many-body Schrödinger equation when the particle number tends to infinity and the Planck constant tends to zero. This research project encompasses three broad directions. The first direction concerns the proof of the classical incompressible Euler equations as a direct limit of quantum many-body dynamics and find the microscopic quantity corresponding to the macroscopic Mach number. The second direction is to rigorously extract the hierarchy structure for the compressible Euler equations induced by quantum many-body dynamics and identify the microscopic quantity which becomes the macroscopic Knudsen number. The third direction turns to the study of the optimal well/ill-posedness separation and the fine nonlinear structure of solutions regarding the important mesoscopic Boltzmann equations via new dispersive methods. The PI and collaborators use techniques from harmonic analysis, probability, and spectral theory to analyze these problems. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",242968,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Quantum Physics
Laser laboratory for nonlinear optical spectroscopy on ferroic materials  with amplified 120-fs pulses,"We study materials with ferroic, that is, spontaneous magnetic, electric, or newly proposed types of long-range order by nonlinear laser-spectroscopic methods. The simplest nonlinear optical process is frequency doubling, also termed 'second harmonic generation' (SHG). Each type of ferroic order changes the symmetry of a material in its individual way and is thus associated with specific contributions to SHG and other nonlinear optical processes. Because of this, we can investigate very different types of order, like magnetic and electric, with the same setup and in the same experiment. We thus access aspects of ferroic order that are difficult to reach with other experimental techniques, including ultrafast processes in antiferromagnets.The PA has developed nonlinear optics as a technique to study the formation, spatial distribution, and time-dependent evolution of ferroic states and domains by nonlinear optics. His expertise is underlined by the distinctions he received on the subject and the monograph he wrote about it, currently the only one in the research area. With-out exception, all the projects in the PA's group involve the optical characterization of ferroic materials by nonlinear laser-spectroscopic methods. Of the two laser laboratories that are in operation since 2007 and 2011, one is now beyond repair. The other one shows an increasing rate of failures. Since without a working laser laboratory virtually all the PA's research work will come to an end, purchase of a new, state-of-the-art laser laboratory is of utmost ur-gency. With the laboratory requested in this proposal, the PA plans to advance his nonlinear-optical approach to ferroics into new realms. In particular, he plans to open up the terahertz regime (1000? the wavelength of visible light), to strongly stimulant studies of ferroics.With regard to the activities planned for the requested laser laboratory, four exemplary chosen goals are presented. (1) In materials combining magnetic and electric order (called multiferroics) the magnetoelectric functionalities ex-pected from the domain walls are explored. (2) A multiferroic state is created by intense laser irradiation. The photo-excitation thus acts as a switch activating a transient magnetoelectric coupling. (3) Time-domain THz spectroscopy is used to investigate the coexistence and competition of exchange-driven magnetic ordering and spin-flip-scattering-induced formation of a heavy spin liquid. The result will advance the understanding of quantum-critical phenome-na. (4) Novel compensated magnetic states like spin-driven ferroaxiality or altermagnetism are explored to find out if they qualify as independent types of spontaneous long-range order.All these projects touch on highly topical issues in the field of ferroic order. Their investigation would not be possible without the use of nonlinear optical methods and the expertise of the PA in these. In projects of this type, his Labora-tory of Multifunctional Ferroic Materials acts as a node in research collaborations around the world that all depend on the outcome of this funding request, even if the PA is its sole applicant.",242471,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Driving Community Learning at Cosmic Scales: Defining Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxies & Radical Mentorship Methods,"Understanding the earliest moments of our Universe continues to be largely elusive, particularly with respect to dark matter and the formation of the first stars and galaxies. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) can help us answer some of these cosmic mysteries as they are believed to be the first galaxies to ever form. A researcher and her team at California State University, San Bernadino, has been awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Faculty Catalyst (AFC) Award to study UFDs in an effort to learn more about galaxy formation, galaxy evolution, and cosmology early in the history of the Universe. A related project will involve studies of stars in our own galaxy, the Milky Way (MW). For over a century, astronomers have used various distance measurement methods to construct a Cosmic Distance Ladder with RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the MW constituting the closest rung. Recent technological advances have created incredibly large data sets of RRL observations. RRL are not only used as distance indicators, but through their radial velocities, they can be tools to measure the MW’s mass. This Award will also enable the creation of a two-year mentorship education curriculum for the Cal-Bridge Program, a California state-wide STEM scholarship program. Numerous STEM-education based reports highlight the importance of mentorship in broadening the participation of students in historically underrepresented groups in STEM and an equal importance on mentors being educated in mentorship. Over the course of the AFC award, previously acquired spectroscopic data from five UFDs will be analyzed to measure metallicities and chemical abundances towards better understanding the scatter in the low stellar mass end of the Stellar Mass-to-Metallicity Relation. By combining the newest large observational datasets, the researchers also plan to create the largest, most accurate RRL 6-dimensional phase space coordinate data table with period-luminosity calibrated radial velocities. This will be employed in an effort to more accurately measure the mass of the Milky Way. In addition, the principal investigator will create and run a trial of a two-year long Cal-Bridge Mentorship Education curriculum consisting of two in-person workshops, and four virtual workshops.

Testing nuclear coalescence with nuclei-antinucleon / antinuclei-nucleon balance measurements at the Large Hadron Collider,"A hot topic at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the production of anti-nuclei. In ultra high-energy collisions at the LHC, nuclei with very low binding energies are not expected to survive the dense and hot final state environment. This project aims to investigate the nuclei and anti-nuclei production in relativistic hadronic collisions at the LHC to test the microscopic mechanism of their production, which is still under debate. In particular, this project would focus on the first experimental measurement of how quantum numbers (in particular baryon number) of produced deuterons are balanced by other hadrons in proton-proton (pp) collisions. One can in this way experimentally test the coalescence hypothesis of nuclei production, directly by measuring if the proton in the deuteron is balanced by an antiproton exactly the same way as for a free proton. If this is the case, then it indicates that the proton in the deuteron is formed in the same way as a free proton. The idea to perform these measurements is presented in this proposal for the first time and has never been performed before. The same measurements can also be compared with the predictions from the famous PYTHIA8 model whose development and maintenance are centered around the Lund University Theory group. The balance is expected to depend on transverse momentum and could depend on multiplicity as this controls the number of final state interactions. To make the highest precision differential measurements, the analysis will use 13.6 TeV pp collision datasets to be taken in Run 3 (2022-2025) with the recently upgraded ALICE detector that can handle rates that are 10-100 times larger than before the upgrade. The ability to perform the measurements takes advantage of the expertise of the fellow and the supervisor who both have a long association with ALICE collaboration at the LHC and has the necessary expertise and network to carry out the measurements.",241091,2025,2027,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Simulating non-Hermitian many-body topological phases with giant atoms,"Non-Hermitian many-body topological phases are drawing substantial attention due to their potential for novel quantum technology. In particular, these phases hold promise for large-scale quantum computations, a technology with substantial scientific and economic impact. However, due to computational difficulties, it remains a remarkable challenge to investigate these phases. Quantum simulation offers a path to overcome this challenge. Yet, efficient simulation of non-Hermitian many-body topological phases is absent. In this project, I will address this gap by theoretically designing novel protocols to simulate non-Hermitian many-body topological phases with giant atoms, a newly prominent quantum optics platform. Notably, giant atoms offer greater control over interactions compared to their smaller counterparts, thus making them versatile for quantum simulation. To achieve the project's goal, I will first design a novel protocol for quantum simulation within the simplest regime of 2 giant atoms, and subsequently generalize it to an advanced protocol for simulating a non-Hermitian topological spin chain. I will perform the theoretical analyses combining many-body methods and quantum simulation methods. This multidisciplinary approach will maximize the outcomes: i) a novel protocol for quantum simulation with giant atoms and ii) an efficient simulation of non-Hermitian many-body topological phases. Consequently, this research project will open up an interdisciplinary research field between non-Hermitian many-body physics and giant atoms, and pave the way toward the long-term goal of realizing large-scale quantum computations. My expertise in non-Hermitian many-body topology and my host's expertise in giant atoms are complementary for carrying out this project. I will establish a detailed dissemination plan to maximize the impact of this project, and a detailed training and transfer plan to benefit the host group and to promote my career to the next level.",241090,2024,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Quantum Physics
Collaborative Research: Local Gravity Disturbances and Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Astrophysics,"According to the National Academies’ 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics ""Gravitational wave astrophysics is one of the most exciting frontiers in science” and a next-generation gravitational-wave observatory in the US is “central to achieving the science vision laid out in the survey’s road map”. Current generation gravitational-wave detectors NSF's Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo have opened the era of gravitational wave astrophysics with the first gravitational wave detections from mergers of binary black hole, binary neutron star, and black hole-neutron star systems, and have triggered a broad range of studies including novel tests of General Relativity, understanding constraints on the interior of neutron stars, and new measurements of the Hubble constant describing the expansion of the universe. Cosmic Explorer, the next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatory in the US, will transform and accelerate the field of gravitational wave astrophysics, enabling investigations of the farthest reaches of our universe and opening new collaboration pathways. This work will help ensure Cosmic Explorer reaches design sensitivity at the lowest frequencies by reducing the impact of disturbances in the local gravitational field around the detectors. This low-frequency sensitivity improvement will enable Cosmic Explorer to observe interesting heavy astrophysical objects such as intermediate-mass black holes and increase early warning capabilities that enable electromagnetic telescopes to view the moment of mergers of compact binary objects. The award will also train students and postdocs in STEM areas. Gravitational wave detectors are responsive to the gravitational forces, as described by Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, induced by any mass that is in close proximity to the instrument. Fluctuations in mass density due to propagating seismic waves create a limit to the instrument’s sensitivity. This work will develop techniques for assessing local gravity disturbances based on simulations and analysis of future measurements of the environment at proposed locations of Cosmic Explorer observatories and will help determine the viability of these candidate locations. The team will develop techniques for measuring and mitigating Newtonian noise using a series of simulations of seismic and other vibrational noise. This work will feed into the conceptual design of the Cosmic Explorer facilities and the local topology surrounding them to minimize the local gravity disturbances near the detector. It will also provide designs of instrument arrays necessary for measuring and inferring Newtonian noise that will be capable of mitigating the influence of those disturbances on the gravitational-wave data stream, and provide preliminary cost estimates for Newtonian noise mitigation. These efforts will enable the 20 dB of seismic Rayleigh wave mitigation required to meet Cosmic Explorer’s low-frequency sensitivity target.

NSF-BSF: Universality Puzzles and Coherent Control of Efimov Physics with 7Li Atoms,"This project aims to advance the understanding of the nature of atomic multi-body interactions in the nearly resonant regime and will study various methods for control and manipulation of their quantum mechanical properties. While a theoretical description of few-atom systems is extremely challenging, requiring the development of highly efficient numerical and computational techniques, it provides a broad and rich range of opportunities to advance scientific knowledge and has potential technological impact. This project represents a theoretical and experimental collaboration via the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF). The combined theory and experimental effort will enable a deeper understanding of few-atom processes which may lead to various applications in atomic clocks, quantum information science, and the exploration of numerous novel phases of matter. Additionally, the educational impact of this research lies in training graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art theoretical and computational research techniques, providing them with valuable skills and knowledge. Recent experimental observations of Efimov physics with 7Li atoms have exhibited discrepancies compared to theoretical calculations, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the concept of universality and its relevance to this particular system. 7Li atoms possess unique properties that distinguish them from other commonly used atomic species in ultracold quantum gases, demanding a more detailed and rigorous analysis. Specifically, the interaction between 7Li atoms is strongly influenced by electronic-exchange interactions, even at significant distances comparable to the van der Waals length. Consequently, electronic-exchange interactions can have a greater impact on Efimov physics in 7Li than in any other atomic species currently under investigation. Addressing this question will enable the development of accurate theoretical models for achieving coherent control over few-body processes. Such control has the potential to stabilize strongly interacting gases by minimizing few-body losses, while also providing avenues to manipulate three-body interactions and create exotic dynamical regimes. Notably, the investigation of superposition states utilized in 7Li interferometric experiments holds particular interest. These experiments have demonstrated coherence times longer than the lifetime of Efimov states themselves, suggesting the existence of novel physical phenomena that current theory has yet to fully comprehend.

Engineering Quantum Fluctuation Phenomena in Nanoscale Quantum Optical Systems,"Nanoscale quantum optical systems enhance the efficacy of light-matter interactions by confining light in small regions. Such systems are integral to a myriad of emerging quantum technological applications: from building single-photon devices and storing and transmitting quantum information over long distances, to facilitating precision tests of fundamental physics. Thus, with growing efforts to miniaturize quantum systems, both with the fundamental motivation to explore quantum phenomena at nanoscales and also with the practical goal of developing modular on-chip architectures, atom-surface interactions at nanoscales become a central facet of developing novel quantum systems. However, when interfacing atoms at nanoscales from photonic structures, the ever-present quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field critically limit the ability to trap and control atoms. This work will develop ways to engineer such quantum fluctuation phenomena – forces, dissipation and decoherence – by leveraging the collective behavior of atomic systems and the ability to manipulate atoms with lasers. Overcoming these critical challenges in the design of nanoscale quantum systems will enable novel functionalities for quantum devices. In addition to the research goals, the PI will train a diverse undergraduate and graduate student workforce at the exciting intersection of Quantum Science and Engineering. As a part of the educational efforts, the PI will develop a multidisciplinary senior level course on Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, engaging students from a diverse array of Science and Engineering majors. This research will build a driven-dissipative Open Quantum Systems approach to engineering quantum fluctuation phenomena – Casimir-Polder forces, dissipation and decoherence – in collective atomic systems near surfaces with the goal to achieve better control and coherence of nanoscale quantum optical systems. The proposed program will build and advance new tools to control quantum fluctuation phenomena, with four main thrusts: (1) Realizing well-controlled and coherent atomic systems at distances of 10-100 nanometers from surfaces by developing near-surface trapping and cooling schemes; (2) Extending the framework of Casimir Physics and macroscopic QED to study fluctuation phenomena with objects that can be prepared in quantum superpositions, entangled or collective states and driven externally; (3) Guiding experiments on high-precision measurements of Casimir-Polder forces with atomic diffraction via nanogratings for creating repulsive drive induced Casimir-Polder forces and manipulating Casimir-Polder forces using collective effects; and (4) Mitigating fluctuation-induced decoherence in experiments with levitated dielectric nanospheres, to realize macroscopic quantum superpositions and correlated states of levitated nanoparticles.

Black Hole Probes of Beyond-Standard Model Particles and Fields,"Black holes are among the most exciting predictions of Einstein's General Relativity. Composed solely of spacetime fabric and described only by their mass, spin, and (electric) charge, they offer unique access to strong-field and nonlinear gravity. Black holes are now regularly observed via gravitational waves, radiation from accretion disks, the motion of stars around them, or black hole images. In this project, the PI's team will develop theoretical and numerical tools to advance our knowledge of gravity theory, black holes, and their interaction with fundamental fields, via gravitational wave observations. The project pursues three main research goals: 1) the study of the superradiant instability of black holes in a general class of cosmological spacetimes against massive scalar fields that represent axion-like particles or dark matter candidates, 2) the study of black holes in axi-dilaton gravity, in which two fundamental scalar fields are coupled to gravity and the simulation of the scalars' out-of-equilibrium dynamics around spinning black holes and determine their end-state. The team will simulate the scalars' evolution around a binary black hole, and determine their impact on the gravitational wave signal. Finally, 3) includes a simulation campaign of binary black holes in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity to create the first gravitational wave catalog in quadratic gravity. The PI's team will partner with the Grainger College of Engineering's Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE) program. The PI will offer six-week summer research experiences to Illinois high-school students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM. Students will be introduced to hands-on scientific research in gravitation and receive expert career counseling for college applications.

QCD at High Temperature and/or Density,"In the standard Big Bang model, the first few instants of the early universe were filled with quark-gluon plasma -- an incredibly high-temperature gas of the constituents of protons and neutrons. In the laboratory, tiny nucleus-sized droplets of quark-gluon plasma have been produced briefly by colliding large atomic nuclei at extremely high energy. The droplets live too briefly to study directly and must instead be studied from the high-energy signatures of the collisions. For instance, some collisions produce additional pairs of extremely high-energy constituents that lose energy by flying through the quark-gluon plasma droplet. So, one way to study properties of quark-gluon plasmas is from measurements related to the amount of such energy loss and its comparison to theoretical calculations. This project tests the validity and self-consistency of methods typically used in theoretical calculations by calculating how thoroughly quantum mechanical corrections influence the energy loss. In addition to studying the theory of probing quark-gluon plasmas, the PI will mentor students engaged in this research and will refine and make publicly available educational materials designed to excite advanced undergraduates and early graduate students into a first exploration of quantum field theory, a fundamental approach to theoretical particle physics. High-energy particles traveling through matter lose energy mainly by showering via splitting processes like bremsstrahlung and pair production, similar to a cosmic ray shower in the atmosphere. In the case here, typical splittings are induced by glancing collisions of the high-energy particle with the constituents of the quark-gluon plasma. In principle, each collision offers a chance for a high-energy particle to split. However, the quantum mechanical duration of that splitting, known as the formation time for the splitting, turns out to grow with energy. At high enough energies, it grows so much that multiple collisions with the plasma occur within the formation time. This causes a large suppression of the splitting rate known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, worked out in the 1950s for electromagnetic interactions (quantum electrodynamics, QED) and the 1990s for the strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics, QCD). This project will study whether formation times can become so large that there is also quantum interference between successive splittings of the shower. This question bears on whether such showers can really be modeled as a growing collection of well-defined numbers of high-energy particles -- a question the project addresses by improving and extending calculations of such quantum interference effects.

Collaborative Research: Stanford-Florida program in Support of LIGO on Coatings and Core Optics,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. The detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015 launched the field of gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational-wave detectors with a two-fold increase in sensitivity over Advanced LIGO would yield an order of magnitude increase in detection rate for black hole coalescences, and enable detection of fainter objects like binary neutron stars, greatly increasing their value for multi-messenger astronomy. All future detector upgrades and concepts rely on the development of new mirror coating materials to reduce thermal noise, which is the core research focus this collaborative project between Martin Fejer's group at Stanford University and Hai-Ping Cheng's group at the University of Florida. Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical loss in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with the mechanical and optical requirements for implementation in future generations of LIGO. Meeting this goal for room temperature detectors requires a solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: understanding the nature of and finding means to reduce the low-energy excitations in amorphous metal oxides. On a longer time-scale, the proposed 3G detectors' cryogenic operation broadens the possible choice of low-noise mirror materials to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The mid-band sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors is limited by thermal noise resulting from mechanical loss in the mirror coatings, and future upgrades including Advanced LIGO Plus will seek to reduce this source of noise by a factor of two or more. The Stanford-Florida partnership, alongside collaborators in the LSC Center for Coatings Research (CCR), has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films, giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide, based on electron and x-ray scattering atomic structure data, will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive-index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. Atomic modeling of coating elastic loss combined with simulations of the coating deposition process will provide guidance for the selection of candidate materials, assist in interpretation of experimental structure data, and will ultimately assist in the design of synthesis experiments. Another long-standing effort at Stanford has been measurements of the absorption of low-optical-loss materials at the sub-ppm/cm level, dating back to the down select between silica and sapphire for initial LIGO test masses. The groups will continue to use the interferometric tool developed for those studies to characterize cryogenic losses in single-crystal silicon samples to evaluate their suitability for implementation in the Voyager technology demonstrator and future cryogenic detectors.

Singularities and Long Time Dynamics in Models of Fluids and Reactive Processes,"This project is composed of two parts. The main objective is the study of mathematical models of fluid motions, and more specifically creation of small-scale structures and singularities in fluids. This is a question of great importance in mathematics as well as in physics and engineering, as it is related to fluid turbulence and also explores how well the theoretical models describe real world phenomena in extreme situations. The project will focus on singularity creation for motions of fluids in porous media (e.g. underground aquifers), in atmospheric science models, as well as for dynamics of fluids near walls and other boundaries. The second objective of the project is the study of propagation of reactive processes (e.g. forest fires) through combustive media. While the dynamics of such a process may intricately depend on small scale variations in the environment, the goal of this part of the project is to demonstrate that in many situations averaging of these variations over large regions results in a more regular and predictable large scale and long-term behavior of the process. This part will also involve the study of propagation of bacterial colonies through nutrient-rich environments, and the enhancement of its speed due to the phenomenon of bacterial chemotaxis. The proposal will provide opportunities for the involvement of students and junior researchers in the research projects. The primary focus of this project is the study of singularities and singular solutions for several nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that serve as models of incompressible fluid dynamics. This includes motion of fluids in porous media on domains with boundaries, such as aquifers sitting on top of impermeable rocky layers; atmospheric science models such as generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equations; as well as Euler equations, modeling motions of ideal fluids, on planar domains with irregular boundaries. In some of these models the relevant local well-posedness theories have not been found yet, so their development will also be an integral part of the project. A secondary focus of the project is a better understanding of large-scale behavior of reactive processes spreading through heterogeneous media, specifically development of a homogenization theory for the nonlinear reaction-diffusion PDE that models such processes occurring in multi-dimensional random media. The goal is to show that under fairly general hypotheses, large scale behavior of solutions to this model is governed by much simpler homogenized PDE that capture the effects of the random variations in the medium averaging out in the long term. In addition, effects of chemotaxis on the speed of propagation of bacterial colonies through nutrient-rich environments will also be studied.

LEAPS-MPS: Higher order partial differential equations in conformal and Riemannian geometry.,"The central idea in Differential Geometry is to study how much a space is curved and the connection with its topology, that is, the study of its shape. A significant example is the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem which links the Gaussian curvature of a surface with a topological invariant. Differential Geometry has many applications in diverse fields such as general relativity, mechanics, thermodynamics, imaging processing and computer science, to name a few. In this project, the PI will investigate geometric and analytic problems related to several higher order curvature quantities, which are natural generalizations of Gaussian curvature in a space of dimensions four and higher. The PI will use this award to train undergraduate and graduate students at Wichita State University in Differential Geometry. The PI will also organize events and outreach activities to attract more students, especially individuals from underrepresented groups, into STEM fields. There has been growing interest in studying higher order curvature quantities with similar properties as Gaussian and scalar curvatures. This project consists of two major objectives. First, the PI will study the Q-curvature Yamabe problem for manifolds with corners or with boundaries in dimensions four and higher. This involves solving a certain type of fourth-order partial differential equations with appropriately chosen geometric assumptions, in hope of finding better geometric characterizations of Q-curvature. Second, the PI will investigate geometric properties and fully nonlinear Sobolev-type inequalities for a larger class of scalar invariants, which arise as the gradient of a Riemannian functional. The proposed approach is to study the relationship of the invariants and the associated multilinear operators through Ovisenko-Redou operators. As an outcome, the PI will to develop better analytic tools for higher order nonlinear geometric analysis problems. This project is jointly funded by LEAPS-MPS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Transport, metastability, and neuromorphic applications in quantum networks","One challenge at the core of quantum technologies is the realization of coherent quantum dynamics at the mesoscopic scale. As the size of a device is scaled up, disorder and dissipation become increasingly relevant and tend to destroy quantum mechanical coherence. Most strategies for mitigating their detrimental effect on quantum operations become quickly inefficient when scaled up to larger numbers of qubits. The goal of TQNet is to provide concepts and methods for manipulating quantum information, where fault-tolerant performance is assisted or even boosted by noise and dissipation. For this purpose, TQNet will assess the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a fully connected networks in the presence and as a function of noise, with a specific focus on quantum transport and information scrambling, and identify protocols whose efficiency is robust against or even boosted by the environment. TQNet joins world-leading theory and experimental scientists with expertise including quantum optics, condensed matter, quantum information, and quantum thermodynamics. The proof-of-principle concepts will be tested on state-of-the-art experimental platforms consisting of (i) ultracold atoms in a high-finesse cavity that interact via a global potential and with tunable temperature, noise and dissipation, and (ii) superconducting quantum circuits that are coupled to on-chip mesoscopic heat baths. On these platforms we will test the role of noise and dissipation on quantum neuromorphic computation.

Atomistic reconstruction of large biomolecular systems from low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy data - RECKON,"The project's aim is to develop a ready-to-use technique for all-atom structure reconstruction of biomolecules using poorly resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. The objectives include developing an intelligent protocol for dealing with low-resolution cryo-EM density, developing a toolkit of scripts or software modules for facilitating the process, and producing all-atom structure of a bacteriophage from newly-acquired cryo-EM data. 
The problem is highly relevant because the amount of published cryo-EM data growth rapidly, especially of large biomolecular objects such as whole viruses. Methodologies of reconstructing molecular structures from these data lag far behind. This strongly limits scientific output of such elaborate and expensive experiments. The ultimate goal of a cryo-EM experiment is an atomistic model of the target that can form the basis for further biochemical research. Currently, the goal can only be achieved if the collected cryo-EM density has high enough resolution to apply the existing reconstruction algorithms. However, often large regions with low resolution are present due to either instrumental or fundamental limitations, making commonly used algorithms to fail.
Our methodology takes additional information on the target into account (chemical structure, biomolecular constraints, etc) in the reconstruction process. The intelligent algorithm to be developed will be able to deal with previously inaccessible regions of cryo-EM data and thus make it possible to reconstruct the target in its atomistic completeness. To test it, a cryo-EM measurement of a Qbeta bacteriophage will be done, which is an important biological target. The produced all-atom model of genome-loaded phage will be of high interest for virologists and molecular biologists, and the technique itself will attract attention of research groups specialising in cryo-EM, including industry.",236587,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; Ukraine,United Kingdom,Condensed Matter Physics
"SPDEQFT: Stochastic PDEs meet QFT: Large deviations, Uhlenbeck compactness, and Yang-Mills","The overarching goal of this proposal is 
(a) to develop novel tools in the field of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and 
(b) to apply them to mathematical quantum field theory (QFT), particularly quantum Yang-Mills (YM) theory. 
The YM measure in the physical 4D space-time describes how elementary particles interact at the subatomic level. Its rigorous mathematical construction, however, has so far eluded substantial progress, and accordingly made the list of famously difficult ""Millenium problems."" On the other hand, SPDE theory has witnessed a number of recent breakthroughs, notably Hairer's theory of regularity structures, which has allowed to make sense of previously ill-posed, singular equations. This proposal aims to develop new tools in SPDEs and regularity structures to analyse the 2D YM measure. The research programme is structured into three projects: 
1. We develop a solution theory for singular non-linear elliptic SPDEs. This significantly extends the scope of equations Hairer's theory allows to treat. At the same time, it provides the right framework to extend Uhlenbeck's compactness theorem to distributions. We use that generalisation to give a new gauge-fixed construction of the 2D YM measure, both on the optimal regularity space and with the natural gauge-invariant observables (Wilson loops) well-defined. 
2. We show that singular (elliptic and parabolic) SPDEs can be analysed using classical Kusuoka-Stroock theory. This contributes to our theoretical understanding of regularity structures and, in particular, allows to derive precise Laplace asymptotics for these equations. 
3. We prove precise Laplace asymptotics of the 2D YM measure in the low temperature limit. This is a novel insight into its qualitative behaviour and generalises a previous large deviation result, which has been obtained by completely different methods.",236587,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics
MHDSSP: Self-sustaining processes and edge states in magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to rotation and shear,"The project aims at investigating self-sustaining processes (SSPs) in astrophysical discs, using concepts and techniques developed in fluid mechanics to understand laminar-turbulent transition (LTT). The importance of SSPs in LTT of wall-bounded flows has long been recognised. These processes typically consist of an array of rolls that drive streamwise streaks, which destabilise and feed back on the rolls. Such processes are closely related to those encountered in dynamo problems of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows, where a poloidal magnetic field generates a toroidal magnetic field, which is unstable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and thus capable of re-generating the poloidal field. In contrast to the hydrodynamic case, little is known about the corresponding process in MHD. Specifically, key questions such as (1) the character of the feedback from the MRI-modes to the poloidal field under the influence of rotation, and (2) the nature of the self-sustaining states are unsolved. Meanwhile, there is a long-standing debate within astrophysics regarding (3) the effects of finite-size domains in numerical simulations on dynamo processes like the one outlined above. The project contains six work packages and seeks to address these open questions through a combination of both analytical and numerical methods. First, an asymptotic theory for SSPs in MHD will be derived that enables self-sustaining states at large Reynolds numbers to be predicted. Then, this theory will be validated and compared against numerically computed self-sustaining states on the verge between laminarity and turbulence. Finally, the influence of the domain size on such states will be studied. The proposed research is not only expected to significantly advance our understanding of the issues (1)-(3) and bring new knowledge to the onset of dynamos in rotating shear flows, but also serve to introduce recent ideas from the dynamical systems theory to the MHD and the astrophysics community.",236585,2024,2025,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Engineering; Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; Physical Sciences
Cosmological and Astrophysical Signatures of New Physics,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Andrew J. Long at Rice University. Whereas the Standard Model of the Elementary Particles has been unerringly successful at describing the properties of the known elementary particles and the forces by which they interact, a combination of cosmological and astrophysical observations furnish overwhelming evidence that New Physics is at play in the fundamental laws of nature. The phenomena of dark matter, cosmic inflation, and the excess of matter over antimatter cannot be explained within the framework of the Standard Model. Candidate theories include the well-studied axion and dark photon, which are being targeted by experimental campaigns in laboratories on Earth. At the same time, it is important to seek out these new particles and forces through their possible manifestations in the cosmos, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, for example. Under this grant award, Professor Long will use the tools of quantum field theory and particle physics to make robust predictions for cosmological and astrophysical signatures of axion, dark photon, and other hypothetical new physics to strengthen the connection with ongoing (and bold, new) experimental activities. This research will advance the national interest by expanding the scope of human knowledge in an effort to better understand the fundamental constituents of nature. This grant award will provide the financial support for graduate student researchers at Rice University where Professor Long will supervise the training of these early-career physicists. In addition, Professor Long will deliver lectures at local high schools and invite students to visit his university’s campus in order to promote science literacy among the general public and to encourage the next generation of physicists. Some specific examples of the work to be performed include: deriving predictions for cosmic microwave background birefringence arising from axion strings and assessing the compatibility with data, developing an analytical model for string network dynamics and assessing the observational implications (e.g., gravitational waves), deriving predictions for the isocurvature associated with gravitationally-produced dark matter to assess the signatures of light spectators during inflation, and evaluating the impact of dark photon dark matter on small-scale structure formation.

PROgramming Gauge-invariant Rydberg AtoM arrays,"Many strongly-correlated phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, from high-Tc superconductivity to quark confinement, can be described by lattice gauge theories (LGT), field theories invariant under local transformations. The immense computational complexity associated with solving LGT using classical computers hinders progress in these fields, where many questions remain open. Although quantum computers can address these questions more efficiently than classical devices, current quantum hardware is limited in the absence of error correction, complicating the reach of a practical quantum advantage in the near term.

Co-designing both quantum hardware and software tailored to simulate LGT, addressing non-trivial regimes while minimizing experimental resources, is therefore a challenging but timely task. Rydberg atoms in tweezer arrays, which have recently emerged as a powerful quantum simulation platform, offer unique capabilities that can be harnessed in this direction. On the one hand, the strong Rydberg interaction and the associated blockade mechanism naturally leads to emergent local symmetries. On the other hand, the possibility of controlling many internal atomic states as well as using fermionic atoms allows to locally encode and simulate non-abelian gauge fields and fermionic matter fields, respectively, minimizing resource overheads.

PROGRAM will investigate this hardware-efficient approach and develop quantum simulation protocols for LGT using Rydberg atom arrays, focusing on three main challenges: (i) simulating non-equilibrium LGT dynamics in 2D, and (ii) implementing non-abelian gauge symmetries, as well as (iii) fermionic matter fields, in a scalable manner. The Researcher will design these protocols using both analog, digital and variational near-term resources, benchmark them in the presence of experimental errors, and run some of them using existing quantum hardware.",234567,2024,2027,European Commission,Spain; United States,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Molecular Spin Interactions in Magnetic Fields of Superconducting Vortices,"Successful implementation of modern quantum technologies is strongly tied to the efficient realization of quantum bits - qubits that promise to revolutionize our current computational and information processing schemes. However, an outstanding challanges concerns the scalability with an expanding number of qubits, making the execution of complex algorithms problematic. In this respect, molecular spin systems are attractive candidates for a scalable qubit platform. The principal idea of the project is to study the behavior and quantum interactions of molecular spin systems exposed to the magnetic fields at the center of Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors (BSCCO, YBCO, NbSe2) using state-of-the-art scanning probe microscopy (SPM). This concept promises access to strongly localized magnetic fields of exceptional strength, offering novel perspectives for molecular qubit research, surface science, and material science. The findings will be further utilized to study magnetic ordering in exotic 2D materials (CrBr3, NiI2) exhibiting noncollinear magnetic ordering. The project's novelty lies both in the methodology and research objectives, which will be achieved via a unique synergy of host group expertise in superconducting substrates and preparation of exotic 2D material systems and researcher's know-how in molecular spin systems and magnetic sensing with functionalized SPM tips (metallocene molecules).",233307,2024,2026,European Commission,Finland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
"Quantum Sensing with Metal-Organic Frameworks: DFT, Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Exploration","Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are composed of metal ions coordinated with organic ligands to form porous structures with high surface areas, making them suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. For instance, MOFs exhibit sensitivity to various molecules and gases due to their high surface area and tailored pores. As such, they can be employed in gas sensors for detecting volatile organic compounds, environmental pollutants, and toxic gases, enabling important applications in environmental monitoring and industrial safety. Despite the incredible success of MOFs as a sensing strategy and sequestration agent, only macroscopic quantities of segregated compounds can be effectively sensed. My project SEnsing with QUantum OrganometallIc frAmeworks (SEQUOIA) will pave the way to the exploitation of quantum sensing for the detection of traces of gases/pollutants in air and water by exploring the potential of MOFs decorated with molecular quantum sensors. Quantum sensing is an emerging area of quantum information science that enables the measurement of physical properties using quantum objects (qubits). Quantum sensors are far more precise than their classical counterpart, potentially allowing them to probe a vast range of physical properties, from magnetic fields to gravity, with unprecedented sensitivity. In particular, molecular qubits represent one of the latest frontiers of spin-based quantum sensors, where long spin coherence times are combined with chemical versatility and the possibility to tailor molecular structures in order to tune the sensor’s properties and tailor sensor-target interactions. SEQUOIA will bring together a diverse set of advanced simulation techniques such as quantum chemistry, machine learning and ab initio spin relaxation theory to deliver an unprecedented computational characterization of the properties of MOFs in realistic environments and thus provide a blueprint for the realization of this cutting-edge technology.",233304,2024,2026,European Commission,Ireland,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Gated Twisted 2D Superconductor Devices for Quantum Technologies (G-TScon2D),"G-TScon2D delves into the exciting realm of superconducting (SC) twistronics, where the manipulation of the twist angle between the layers has opened up new avenues for investigating unconventional superconductivity, quantum transport, and emergent phenomena. A significant research gap exists in understanding and harnessing the unique properties of twisted 2D SC materials. G-TScon2D will bridge the scientific gap through a correlated experimental and simulation approach. Its technological advantage lies behind the inherent SC nature of the planned materials, which is expected to lead to higher operating temperature, a critical condition in quantum computing application. The primary objectives of G-TScon2D are to unravel the quantum phenomena and electronic states that arise from stacking and twisting SC layers at precise angles and to explore the SC-to-insulating switching properties by applying vertical gate field. G-TScon2D is a multidisciplinary project in nature and includes the development of 2D SC twisted device fabrication and carrier transport characterisation. G-TScon2D will benefit from close collaboration with a simulation team in the host, which will provide insight into the properties of twisted SC structures and the impact of gate field on those properties. Discoveries in 2D SC materials will accelerate the development of quantum technologies within the EU Quantum and Graphene flagships goal: “Turn Wonder into Action”. G-TScon2D contributes to expanding Europe’s leadership and excellence in this research area, to starting a competitive European industry in Quantum Technologies, and to making Europe a dynamic and attractive region for innovative research, business and investments in this field.

UltrAfast correLated Two-dimensional mOiré Superlattices,"As one of the most fascinating phenomena in physics, strong correlation exists across a wide range of scales from planet to electron. Researchers have been pursuing a thorough understanding of strong-correlation phenomena for decades. In addition to the equilibrium correlated states detected by electric methods, nonequilibrium correlated dynamics that reveals more fingerprints of many-body interaction at a transient timescale is also significant. The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices provides an excellent platform to probe localized nonequilibrium correlation phenomena by ultrafast laser excitation and spectroscopic detection with high resolution in both space and time. The combination of large moiré lattices in space and femtosecond-scale resolution in time will offer us a powerful tool to unravel the signature of unconventional dynamics of strong-correlated states, which not only deepens our understanding of complex quantum systems but also holds promise for the development of advanced technologies with transformative applications in fields like quantum computing and energy transmission.  This interdisciplinary training scheme aims to enhance Dr. Shang’s expertise in photonics, strengthening his skills and helping him establish a research career in Europe. The program covers component design and implementation, theoretical analysis and photonics experiments. To assist Shang in reaching professional maturity and increase his exposure to academic and industrial collaborations, he will receive training on intellectual property management, funding and proposal writing, commercialization, business and finance management, supervision, and teaching. Additionally, Shang will have the opportunity to establish cooperation with Prof. Abajo (ICFO, Spain) as part of an academic secondment.

Tracing the origin of volatile elements in Earth and Mars using nucleosynthetic compositions of potassium and zinc in meteorites.,"The Solar System has long been thought to represent the only habitable planetary system. The discovery that planets orbiting Sun-like stars are common in our Galaxy has fostered the concept of planetary habitability, which defines the conditions at the surface of a planet required for life to develop, including the presence of volatiles, energy, and organic chemistry. Elucidating the relationship between the formation pathways of rocky planets and their potential habitability is crucial in that regard.
One way to approach this is to determine the origin and composition of the building blocks of planets. Meteorites are witnesses of the earliest stages of planetary accretion and are ideal for this task. Nucleosynthetic anomalies (which are mass-independent variations of the isotope composition) measured in meteorites provide insights into the building blocks of planets. They are robust tracers because they are not affected by geodynamic and chemical differentiation of the planets. However, the determination of the building blocks of planets necessitates to consider a holistic approach considering constraints from elements with different volatility and cosmochemical behaviour in all extra-terrestrial materials. For instance, nucleosynthetic anomalies of refractory lithophile and siderophile elements do not provide precise constraints on the origin of volatile elements in planets.
The very recent identification of nucleosynthetic anomalies in moderately volatile elements K and Zn opens new avenues of research as robust proxies of more volatile elements. This project aims at determining the source of the nucleosynthetic anomalies of moderately volatile elements and defining the building blocks of Earth and Mars building blocks and the source of volatile elements. I will use next generation instrumentation combined with emerging technologies to carry out this project.",232656,2025,2026,European Commission,Denmark,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Elucidating the Structural Origin of NIR-Emission from Ag-DNA,"The interest in atomically precise metal cluster systems has grown over the last decades due to the physicochemical properties that emerge at the nanoscale compared to the bulk regime. Despite promising features, stability often hinders their use in real-life applications. Since stabilization is critical, DNA has been proven to be a functional and versatile scaffold for luminescent silver clusters. DNA oligomers are intrinsically biocompatible and are able to tune the emission color and promote high photoluminescence efficiencies.
Near-infrared emitting DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (NIR-emitting Ag-DNAs) are promising candidates for several potential applications, such as bioimaging and sensing, due to improved cell and tissue penetration of NIR light. The development of NIR emissive Ag-DNAs currently needs to be improved by three main challenges: extremely limited structural information (only one is available), absence of a rationale for designing NIR-emitting Ag-DNAs with high luminescence yield, and poor understanding of
This project aims to address these gaps by first synthesizing and screening a wealth of NIR-emitting Ag-DNAs and then employing state-of-the-art techniques, such as pair distribution function analysis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, to characterize the best-performing candidates structurally. 
Establishing a structure-luminescence rationale for NIR-emitting Ag-DNAs will be the ultimate goal of the project. Such findings are paramount to performing electronic structure calculations, and it is the needed input for machine learning algorithms to predict NIR-emitting Ag-DNAs with tailored optical properties. The results of this proposal will thus pave the way for a myriad of different applications.",232656,2024,2026,European Commission,Denmark,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Gravitational Wave Theory: Feynman Toolbox for Einstein Gravity,"Since the discovery of Gravitational Waves from a binary black hole merger in 2016, we have entered a new era in exploring the Universe. Binary black hole and neutron star mergers are the primary sources of gravitational waves. High-accuracy theoretical predictions for the motion of compact binary systems play a fundamental role in interpreting data and maximizing discovery potential for present and future observations, such as LIGO-Virgo-Kagra. I have played a pioneering role in the development of a new framework aiming at efficiently calculating gravitational-wave observables using modern theoretical tools initially invented for CERN’s LHC experiments. Using this framework, we have obtained the most precise theoretical predictions for the gravitational dynamics of binary inspirals to date.

This project aims to push the precision frontier for theoretical predictions for the gravitational observables of inspiralling binary systems. This will be achieved by innovating computational methods for classical gravitational dynamics using cutting-edge techniques from quantum field theory and modern mathematics, including Feynman integrals, effective field theory, special functions and applied algebraic geometry. We will derive a set of new precision corrections for the dynamics of inspiralling binaries, including spin and finite-size effects, beyond the current state of the art. These new results will be used to construct more accurate waveform models. The latter are crucial to understanding long-standing questions in fundamental physics and astronomy with next-generation gravitational-wave observations, such as the LISA and the Einstein Telescope in Europe, which in turn may provide fundamental insights into Einstein's theory of gravity.",232656,2024,2026,European Commission,Denmark,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Physical Sciences
Homology of labelled configuration spaces via spectral Lie algebra methods,"The goal of this project is to produce new computations of the mod p homology of labelled configuration spaces of a general manifold with labels in an arbitray spectrum. These computations have remained outstanding challenges for decades except in special cases. Recently developed techniques in stable homotopy theory, including spectral Lie algebras and synthetic homotopy theory, have proven to be useful in understanding the algebraic structure on the homology groups of labelled configuration spaces in universal cases, but are less attuned to the topology of the input manifolds. In this project, I plan to attack the problem by incorporating the homotopy-theoretic methods with approaches that take into account the geometry of labelled configuration spaces. New computations of these objects will have applications in a range of fields including stable homotopy theory, string topology, embedding calculus of manifolds, mathematical physics, and motion planning.

Fundaments of Black Hole Spectroscopy,"Gravitational Wave (GW) astronomy has emerged as a fundamental field, allowing us to probe gravity in its strongest regime. Black hole (BH) spectroscopy is a highly effective method for extracting spacetime information from observed GW signals. The late-time radiation of newly formed black holes is characterized by an exponentially damped, oscillating signal. Measuring the decaying scales and oscillating frequencies — the so-called quasinormal modes (QNMs) — offers insightful information about the black hole's background. Therefore, QNMs and BH spectroscopy are crucial in astrophysics, gravitational physics, and mathematical relativity.

The goal of this project is to combine mathematical relativity, numerical relativity, and astrophysics to advance the fundamental theory of BH spectroscopy. Theoretical predictions indicate that small perturbations around a black hole can drastically change its QNM spectra. Thus, in dirty environments, QNMs may deviate from the values expected for isolated BHs. Modern tools from differential geometry and high-accuracy numerical methods allow us to understand this QNM instability. This project will provide a solid theoretical foundation, which integrated into the efforts to measure QNMs, will optimise the scientific gains from BH spectroscopy in the upcoming era of high-accuracy GW astronomy.

The applicant has solid expertise in the mathematical fundaments of general relativity. With the MSCA fellowship, the applicant will enhance her knowledge of fundamental aspects of BH spectroscopy thanks to the expertise of the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI), University of Copenhagen. The Strong group at NBI is composed of leading researchers in the area, providing the perfect environment for this multidisciplinary project. An academic secondment at the University of Texas at Austin will consolidate the acquired knowledge and ensure the project’s impact on key stakeholders, such as the Ligo-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the Lisa Mission.",232655,2024,2026,European Commission,Denmark; United States,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Physical Sciences
Swimming Giants: Illuminating the super-massive-binary and gas interaction,"Nearly all galaxies in the universe harbor a super-massive black hole (SMBH)---with mass a million to a billion times that of our sun---in their core. When these galaxies merge, their super-massive black holes are brought together to form a super-massive black hole binary that interacts with the newly forming galaxy's stars and gas.  A cosmic population of these super-massive binaries is hypothesized as the source for the gravitational wave background (GWB) detected for the first time this June. The full evolution and ultimate fate of these binaries, however, remains one of the most enduring mysteries in astrophysics. A key element to revealing the destinies of these binaries and unlocking their multi-messenger observational prospects is to understand their late-stage interactions with ambient gas in the nascent galactic nucleus. In the proposed research program, I will deploy state-of-the-art hydrodynamics simulations of the mutual interaction between compact super-massive binaries and their gaseous environments to develop cutting-edge models of gas-driven binary evolution and its associated observational signatures. These models will be essential to current and forthcoming electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations as the GWB detection (and upcoming LISA mission) open the floodgates on the next-generation of multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology with super-massive binaries; just as the first LIGO detection did for their stellar-mass counterparts 8 years ago.
The Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen is the ideal location for me to pursue this research program because of their long-standing history and expertise in numerical hydrodynamics, astrophysical gas dynamics, and gravitational wave phenomena; and the Marie Curie Fellowship would enable substantial development of my skills as a researcher, educator, and communicator in order to achieve my goal of eventually leading an independent research group as a professor.",232654,2024,2026,European Commission,Denmark,EU,Astronomical Sciences
A quantum approach to symbolic dynamics,"This project in pure mathematics aims to solve problems in symbolic dynamics (a mature branch of dynamics with important connections to coding theory, information theory, and operator algebras) using tools from the modern theories of quantum information and quantum groups. The central challenge dating back to at least the 1970s is to classify symbolic dynamical systems. My proposal pioneers a highly interdisciplinary and novel approach using the uniquely quantum phenomena of ‘entanglement’ and ‘noncommutativity’ as they appear in quantum information/quantum groups. The main objective is therefore to establish a fruitful connection between symbolic dynamics, quantum information theory and quantum groups to the benefit of all three communities.
The proposal is based around two central open problems: how do we classify symbolic systems, and what are the symmetries of symbolic systems? A novel approach to these problems builds on the recent advances made in part by the supervisor that connect graph theory with quantum information/quantum groups. I introduce a new nonlocal game (the Conjugacy Game) that will define ‘quantum conjugacies’, and a notion of quantum automorphism that will define ‘quantum symmetries’ of symbolic systems. This marks the first interaction between quantum information/quantum groups and symbolic dynamics. The ideas are therefore very timely, will have high impact, and set a precedent for future uses of quantum mathematics in other domains and specifically other classes of dynamics (e.g. multidimensional subshifts and algebraic actions).
The fellowship will strengthen my academic career via the opportunity to learn new tools in quantum mathematics and apply them to solve important problems in dynamics. It will also allow me to establish new collaborations with leading experts in dynamics and quantum information/quantum groups that will play a key role in my goal of obtaining a permanent academic job and an investigator grant to build a research g",232654,2025,2027,European Commission,Denmark,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Pure Mathematics; Quantum Physics
Dynamics of Nonlinear Dispersive Equations,"Dispersive equations are ubiquitous in nature, arising in areas such as water waves, optics, lasers, ferromagnetism, particle physics, general relativity, nonlinear elasticity, and many others. Examples are nonlinear Schrödinger equations that govern Bose–Einstein condensates, a fascinating phenomenon predicted by quantum statistical mechanics, for which the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded following experimental verification. Solitons, or coherent solitary waves, are an extraordinary and still mysterious feature of solutions to dispersive equations. The project’s overarching goal is to establish (in)stability results for solitons, further study their dynamics even in the presence of (in)elastic collisions and blow-up phenomena and understand the soliton resolution conjecture for general solutions. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. Combining techniques from partial differential equations (PDE), harmonic analysis, asymptotic analysis, dynamical systems, and spectral theory, this project explores qualitative descriptions of the dynamics of dispersive waves from three distinct perspectives. The first objective is to understand the dynamics of multi-solitons in dispersive equations, focusing on their stability, uniqueness, and (in)elastic collisions. The second objective is to examine the asymptotic stability of (topological) solitons under the influence of long-range scattering and internal modes. The third objective is to utilize integrable structures to investigate the dynamics of physically important integrable systems and their perturbations.

LEAPS-MPS: Unveiling the Role of a Galaxy's Structure with Bespoke Numerical Models,"Galaxies come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and each has a subtly different rate at which it forms stars and depletes its gas supply. Spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way, act as great star formation engines of the Universe. Over their several billion-year histories they convert their gas reservoirs into stellar material. These stars then deliver energy and material back into the interstellar medium (ISM). The principal investigator will use computer simulations to gauge the role of the shape and dynamics of a given galaxy in determining how well it forms stars. By comparing six model galaxies, spanning a range of morphologies, connections can be made between structure and rate of star formation and inform interpretations of data from modern observational facilities. The project will employ two undergraduate researchers who will be tasked with constraining initial conditions of the simulations, testing new physics routines in the simulation code, and comparing results of simulations to observable data products. The PI will also develop a new undergraduate astrophysical research methods course to foster greater interest in astronomy and prepare students for higher level degrees in the field. The team will conduct hydrodynamical+gravitational numerical simulations of nearby systems to assess to what degree a galaxy’s structure and dynamics are a controlling factor in regulating its star forming activity. A complete picture of the star formation process is vital throughout astronomy, tying directly into the numbers of stars formed in a given location in a galaxy, their resulting elemental abundances, and conditions surrounding them. Currently, there is a lack of a suite of galactic simulations tailored to specific nearby galaxies in the field. This work will be the first of its kind and will formulate a tailored set of models that would act as a 1:1 comparison tool to test models of gaseous and stellar physics and their role in cloud creation and star formation. This will allow a detailed study of the impact of spiral arms and galactic bars inherent to these systems on the star formation process and in sculpting their dense gas. The project will use an array of metrics to test the model results against real observations, including resolved star formation relations, scale-heights of gas/stars, and structure/kinematics of gaseous disks.

"Liquid crystals, their suspensions, and extreme wave phenomena in photonic devices","This project has two scientific research threads: a) liquid crystals (and their suspensions), and b) extreme wave phenomena in photonic devices. Concerning a): Certain materials, often made up of rod-like or disc-like molecules, display a range of ""liquid crystalline phases"" at suitable temperature/concentration ranges; these phases lie between the traditional (disordered) liquid and (ordered) crystalline phase, and thus possess varying degrees of order. Liquid crystals and their suspensions have revolutionized the industry of ultra-thin display devices and are showing promise in a number of other applications such as drug delivery, active matter and the orientation of carbon nanotubes. Concerning b): The photonic devices studied in this project include certain novel kinds of resonators, waveguides, and antennas. Particular focus is on devices made from epsilon near zero materials: these are materials whose dielectric permittivity is close to zero at the frequency of device operation. These novel devices find applications in efforts to enhance light-matter interactions. Common to both scientific threads of the proposed research is that their mathematical modeling leads to unconventional questions in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations that require new analytical tools that this project will develop. The scientific broader impact of this research is that its findings are expected to shed valuable insights on specific models used in application areas. These insights are expected to explain the results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) when this is possible, and more importantly, provide qualitative and (sometimes) quantitative information when DNS becomes formidable or even prohibitive. The project will also include a significant component on human resource development: a number of the projects in this award will be carried out in collaboration with graduate students and postdocs at the University of Utah. The trainees will learn, use, and develop tools in the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory and homogenization theory. Concerning liquid crystals, at the heart of their role in the aforementioned applications are both their anisotropic properties leading to their ordered phases on the one hand, and the rich phase transitions they can undergo between phases displaying varying degrees of order. This project will elucidate these effects through mathematical modeling and analysis and explain how they robustly result in a description of the shapes of the phase boundaries between the ordered nematic and disordered isotropic phase. A different goal of the research thread on liquid crystals is the justification of the widely used ""electrostatic"" description of the many-particle interactions in out-of-equilibrium liquid crystal colloids. Such a description is invaluable, because without it the modeling of liquid crystal colloids consists of a highly nonconvex, nonlinear problem in a domain exterior to the colloidal particles (coupled with other multi-physics aspects of the specific application). Concerning photonic devices: The mathematical problems addressed will involve either the Maxwell system (in 3D) or the scalar Helmholtz equation (in 2D) but with piecewise constant, complex coefficients; often such systems interact in interesting ways with geometric features such as corners, producing resonance effects. This project is aimed at understanding these effects, and some novel shape optimization problems arising from these physical situations. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",230111,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Quantum Atom Light Interfaces in High Density Samples,"Light mediated dipole-dipole (DD) interactions in high density samples constitutes an interesting source of complex physical phenomena. Ultracold atomic systems provide a unique platform to study such fundamental phenomena. This project targets the systematic study of the light mediated DD interactions in Yb atoms, a two-electron atom. This remains a highly unexplored regime where even simulations for small atom numbers remain difficult. A profound knowledge of the DD coupling  mechanism can have severe implications in our understanding of atom-light quantum interactions in high density samples, and can open the way to new and exciting possibilities in quantum simulation or quantum metrology. 
We will study DD interactions in high spatial and optical density samples of Yb. Our main goal is to understand line shifts for near-resonance probing light in the usual weak drive regime, but also in the strong and pulsed operation regimes. The expected line shifts will inevitably affect the atomic population dynamics, which has implications in advanced metrological protocols (Rabi/Ramsey spectroscopy) currently used in state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. Understanding and harnessing DD interactions in such context can be a crucial step towards more precise and stable atomic sensors.",229215,2024,2025,European Commission,France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Isomers in Odd-Odd Nuclei,"This proposal delves into the science of nuclear isomers, complex quantum states with distinct energy levels and long lifetimes. Isomers hold untapped potential in nuclear physics and astrophysics, capable of revolutionizing energy production, impacting stellar evolution, enhancing timekeeping, and transforming medical imaging. Modelling isomers remains an ongoing challenge. With the global interest in isomer research growing, new models for the description of isomerism must be pursued. With this idea in mind, the proposal aims to develop an innovative theoretical framework unifying existing nuclear models, specifically, the algebraic interacting boson fermion-fermion model with constraints coming from shell model interactions, to bridge the theory gaps for resolving the mysteries of odd-odd isomers. This is in line with the mutual interests of the applicant and supervisor.

Odd-odd nuclei are very rich in the number of isomers, but their quantitative understanding is still amiss. Their isomer data will be analyzed to search for the global similarities and differences in spectroscopic properties across the nuclear landscape. The main goal is to quantify the decay properties, lifetimes, and structure of odd-odd isomers, particularly in shape-transitional regions, where the isomeric structure gets very complex and is not yet properly understood. The new theoretical tool will be generic in nature and can be used to study other nuclear physics phenomena, having a longer-term influence on nuclear physics research even after the fellowship. Interdisciplinary and broad-range nuclear physics applications, including Bose-Einstein Condensate, superheavy nuclei, and isomer experiments will be established, benefiting from the expertise of senior experimental collaborators at GANIL, Surrey, and London. The plan envisions cross-fertilisations between theoretical insights and experimental data, boosting the applicant's career, and inspiring the scientific awareness of the public.",229212,2024,2026,European Commission,France; France,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Approaching the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 2D materials by nanoengineering,"Nanoengineering techniques have been developed to reduce thermal conductivity (κ) and improve the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of materials. However, both these strategies have had their own limitations. Firstly, due to the nanopatterns only reducing the κ in a single direction, is difficult to reduce the total κ of thermal isotropic materials. Secondly, when nanoengineering the material to increase ZT by lowering its κ, the nanopatterned sample with large porosity (> 0.5) can greatly remove its volume and suppress the electron mean free path, which would also significantly reduce the electrical conductivity (σ) and resulted in a low increase of the ZT value. CARMEN will overcome these limitations by taking two advantages of emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially SnSe2: a high Seebeck coefficient of 500 μV/K at 298 K and a high anisotropic κ ratio of ~ 8.4. Therefore, nanoengineering 2D materials can reduce their κ to approach the maximum value of ZT with a limited reduction in σ. Additionally, the phonon drag of SnSe2 was first revealed by the applicant during a three-month research visit in the supervisor's group, which will be further investigated by CARMEN. To understand and exploit the thermoelectric properties of 2D materials, CARMEN will design, construct, measure, and explore nanopatterned SnSe2 to approach its maximum thermoelectric ZT value above room temperature and to manipulate the phonon drag in SnSe2 at low temperatures (1 - 273 K). The project is motivated in part by the urgent need for highly thermoelectric ZT materials to harvest waste heat from electronics, and in part by the fundamental quest toward understanding and manipulating the phonon-electron interaction in 2D materials. It represents an extraordinary training opportunity on complementary scientific and soft skills for the applicant and has transformational impact potential on flexible thermoelectric devices, thermal engineering, quantum technologies, and beyond.",229212,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Quantum Physics
Collective effect with ordered nanofiber-trapped atomic arrays as efficient light-matter interfaces,"Efficient interactions between photons and quantum emitters are at the heart of numerous quantum information devices, such as quantum memories, switches or gates. Using chains of individual cold atoms trapped close to an optical nanofiber, the goal of the proposed research is to exploit the enhanced linear and non-linear quantum interactions that can result from the unique features of such one-dimensional ordered arrays. Periodically arranged atomic structures indeed exhibit specific light scattering properties, i.e., Bragg reflection, super-, sub- and even selective radiance. The interaction of guided light with ordered arrays can lead to tailored functionalities unavailable in current light-matter interfaces. Novel and resource-efficient quantum memory and gate protocols will be targeted. This project will push this original light-atom array paradigm towards building blocks for future quantum technologies. The candidate, with a strong background in atomic physics, quantum optics, and nonlinear optics will exploit his expertise to develop the project while extending his skillset towards the implementation of quantum information networks and further developing his innovation and leadership abilities during the fellowship.",229212,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Detecting and Distinguishing Majorana Modes through Atomic Scale Shot Noise,"An exciting area of research in quantum condensed matter physics involves the exploration of Majorana bound states (MBS) to create topologically protected qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In the quest for experimental evidence of these quasiparticles, the most frequently observed indication of MBS is considered as a peak in the differential conductance spectra at zero bias voltage. While this observation could be easily detected in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy experiments, it does not serve as a piece of conclusive evidence for the Majorana nature of a state as other topologically trivial bound states, such as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, can also exhibit the same zero-bias conductance peak. In this direction, recent theoretical investigations have extensively examined how shot noise at atomic could serve as a distinctive tool to differentiate between MBS and trivial bound states in vortex matter and nanowires. However, experimental verification of these theories has not been feasible so far due to the underlying challenge of measuring shot noise with high enough sensitivity at a nanometer resolution. Although experimentally challenging, in this project we will combine atomically resolved differential conductance and shot noise together by using a home-built shot-noise scanning tunneling microscope (SN-STM). The unprecedented power of this technique will be exploited to measure shot noise which provides direct evidence to distinguish the MBS from any conventional in-gap mode. We propose to investigate a couple of different scenarios such as single atomic impurities and vortex cores in a variety of iron-based superconducting quantum material, magnetic nanostructure (1D chains) coupled to an s-wave superconductor.",229212,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics"
INTEgrating GaN nanowire heterostructures on 2D heteRogeneous plAtforms for photodetectION,"III-nitride semiconductors (GaN/AlGaN) are strategic materials for photodetection in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to far infrared. These domains can be addressed thanks to interband and intersubband transitions respectively, which cover wavelengths inaccessible to standard III-V semiconductors. Heterogeneous integration of III-N nanowires (NWs) on 2D materials at the same time opens new technological opportunities for advanced optoelectronics and presents fundamental interest to elucidate the physics of van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE). Available research on epitaxial growth of GaN NWs on 2D graphene has demonstrated its promise; however, the scope for improvement remains limited. A number of questions with fundamental significance e.g. the influence of the 2D material in NW growth, controlling factors for NW size/size-distribution, and generalized understanding of vdWE with experimental authentication remain open. INTEGRASION proposes to address these open questions and to achieve a general understanding of vdWE of nitrides on 2D materials for advanced optoelectronic devices. To reach this goal, GaN/AlGaN NWs will be grown on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (WS2) and comparative analysis will be performed with growth on graphene. The fundamentals of growth process will be assessed experimentally and theoretically emphasizing the impact of 2D materials on the NW growth which is pivotal for heterojunction formation. GaN/AlGaN heterojunctions in multi-quantum well structure will be grown on 2D platforms to demonstrate interband UV photodetection as well as intersubband photodetection in mid- and far-infrared domains. Besides, heterogeneous integration of GaN NWs on 2D platforms will facilitate the post-growth transfer of III-N NWs to flexible substrates where monolithic integration is not possible. INTEGRASION will address these three key aspects: (i) heterogenous growth, (ii) interband/intersubband photodetection and (iii) hybrid integration.",229212,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics
Reagentless Organic Synthesis,"""This project proposal, """"Reagent-less Organic Synthesis through Vibrational Strong Coupling,"""" addresses the pressing need in synthetic chemistry for sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical transformations. It aims to harness the power of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) to enable reagent-less, clean chemical reactions with maximum atom economy and minimal waste generation.
VSC involves selectively coupling a molecule's vibrational transition to the zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations of an optical cavity. This coupling, even in the absence of light, creates vibro-polaritonic states that can alter the ground-state reactivity landscape. VSC being a nascent field has shown promise in modifying some chemical reactions, however, many fundamental questions remain unanswered.
The research plan combines the fabrication and characterization of optical cavities, monitoring coupling strength and reaction kinetics using FT-IR spectroscopy, product characterization with GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy, and advanced spectroscopic techniques. Collaboration with experts in computational quantum physics will bridge the gap between theory and experiment.
This project's innovative aspects lie in its potential to achieve selectivity in chemical reactions that are challenging or impossible through conventional methods, eliminating the need for expensive catalysts, hazardous reagents, or harsh conditions. By exploring a range of reactions and studying the underlying principles, this project contributes to sustainable chemical synthesis, aligning with the goals of circular economy strategies and innovative energy-efficient practices.

Spintronics based on Ferroelectrics,"Current state of the art technologies demand high density and high performance electronic devices with reduced energy consumption. This stretches the performance limits of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) transistors technology. Among the many beyond CMOS approaches, one of the most promising routes is the spintronics ecosystem. In the framework of this project, we aim to investigate a beyond CMOS spintronics device recently proposed and called Ferroelectric Spin Orbit (FESO) device, where the spin polarized states of a Rashba interface are manipulated through its proximity with a ferroelectric material. The project’s innovation relies on the exploitation of this effect to transform spin to charge currents in a controllable manner through the reversing a ferroelectric’s polarization, to develop a new in memory computing technology. The FESO technology involves non-volatility, low operating voltage and much lower energy consumption compared to conventional CMOS and other spintronic devices. As a main scientific objective, the researcher will investigate and understand the effect of the ferroelectric layer to FESO devices performance in terms of materials choice, growth quality, dimensions and compatibility to Ferromagnetic materials. The main technological objective is to fabricate a prototype and characterize its operational performance with regards to cutting edge nanoelectronics standards. The results of the project and key performance of the FESO device will be tabulated in a roadmap. During this project the researcher will be trained in advanced Nanofabrication techniques and device characterization.

Tracing Dynamical Evolution of Dark Matter via Machine Learning,"""We plan to answer two pivotal questions of modern astrophysics: the nature of dark matter and its interaction with baryonic processes. Utilizing galaxy observations and cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations across a redshift range of z = 0.3-2.5, we will examine 3-10 Gyr of cosmic history. 

We propose to """"Trace the Dynamical Evolution of Dark Matter via Machine Learning""""- TraDE-DML, that pioneers an advanced methodology for assessing the dynamical masses of galaxies, aiming for unprecedented precision in the quantification of both baryonic and dark matter components. Unlike conventional velocity profile studies, TraDE-DML eliminates assumptions of symmetry and dynamical equilibrium, substantially reducing uncertainties in dark matter estimates. Our project aims to exploit existing and future survey data, preparing for expansive telescopic projects like ELT and SKA. Simple in concept but revolutionary in application, the machine learning techniques used in TraDE-DML are poised for transformative advances in dark matter studies, particularly in determining its central density slope. By synergistically integrating knowledge from observational astronomy, theoretical physics, machine learning, and statistics, TraDE-DML aims to make significant strides in unraveling the elusive nature of dark matter. 

As an expert in observational data analysis with privileged access to leading galaxy surveys like MAGPI and MIGHTEE, I possess the skills to efficiently extract and analyse pertinent data. The host, Dr. Benoit Famaey, excels in galaxy dynamics and alternative dark matter theories. Supported by a team versed in cosmological simulations and machine learning experts at the Inter-disciplinary Institute IRMIA++, we form a unique research synergy. Utilizing advanced machine learning frameworks and leveraging expansive survey data, TraDE-DML is well-positioned for immediate execution.

Affordable TAndem Cell Architecture by Multi-thin-epitaxy Approach,"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is essential to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We need more and better photovoltacis (PV) to drastically reduce the CO2 emissions. PV will need to be widely distributed to be able to replace the enormous (and growing) amounts of conventional electrical energy. Availability of surface areas allocated to PV, preferably close to the end use of the electricity, will become an issue. Reliability and a high energy yield per area will become important for the success of PV products. Europe presents higher complexity than other regions, because of its limited space and high-density population. 
Current Silicon technology is basically limited by its single junction (one semiconductor bandgap) to efficiencies below 30%. Multi-junctions/Tandems using more than one semiconductor diode (aiming at different energies in the spectrum) are the demonstrated path to overpass this limit and achieve efficiencies close to 40%, as done for three junctions (3J) on III-V and with 35% achievable by using a Si bottom junction (3J GaInP/GaAs/Si). Two tandems technologies have emerged as promising to upgrade the current Si technology: perovskites/Si and III-V/Si.  III-V/Si presents the highest efficiency and stability (20-30years) but two orders of magnitude higher cost. 
The ATACAMA project will develop the top junction for a III-V/Si tandem (AlGaAs/Si), with a drastic reduction in cost for the III-Vs by (1) ultra-thin absorbers using low-cost nanostructuring and (2) substrate multi-thin-epitaxial enable by a novel epitaxial lift-off process. Furthermore, the III-V/Si tandem has to attain a high efficiency (>30%)(3), that will ensure a cost-effective solution. Nevertheless, the tandem must ensure circularity (recyclable path) to split the Si from the III-V, by gluing with transparent polymers, with a melting point of 200°C, ensuring the possibility of easily recycling in the future the AlGaAs cell from the Si cell.",229211,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
"Challenging the state-of-the-art of low intensity noise, single frequency fiber lasers","The focus of this project is the development of state-of-the-art kW-class, low noise, single frequency (SF) fiber laser. SF lasers operate with a single longitudinal mode, emitting quasi-monochromatic light with kHz-class linewidth and low intensity noise. This class of lasers are in great demand for precision time/frequency metrology, atom cooling, coherent LIDAR, and laser spectroscopy. However, power scaling SF fiber lasers, while maintaining its low noise properties and high beam quality has been a challenge due to the onset of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and transverse modal instability (TMI) that disrupt the stable system operation beyond a certain power level (known as threshold). But high-power (> 500 W) low-intensity noise, SF lasers with high beam quality are quintessential for building next generation interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) and efficient neutral beam injector systems for fusion reactors. The current state-of-the-art for these systems is limited to ~ 400 W in an all-fiber architecture. We intend to challenge it by developing kW-class, low-noise SF fiber laser by using optimized laser design, novel ytterbium-doped fibers (commercial and customized) and efficient techniques to suppress the undesirable nonlinear and thermal effects. Such a system would also be valuable in understanding the dynamics and interplay between SBS and TMI and developing an accurate system model for optimized laser parameters and threshold levels. For this, we seek to combine the expertise of the applicant (Roopa Prakash), in building kW-class, narrow linewidth (~10 GHz), polarization-maintaining fiber lasers with the expertise of Giorgio Santarelli’s group in developing state-of-the-art low-intensity noise, SF lasers using specialty fibers. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will generate advances beyond the state-of-the-art not only in the fields involved in its development, but also in those where this laser can be applied.",229211,2024,2026,European Commission,France; France,EU,Classical Physics
Ab initio nucleaR Reactions in the Discovery perioD of exotic nuclei.,"A century after its discovery, the atomic nucleus remains a subtle organization of protons and neutrons interacting through QCD. Its properties are the driving mechanism of cataclysmic events in the cosmos like those leading to the synthesis of medium-to-heavy elements. Unfortunately, precise, fundamental nuclear data, which are essential both to the sustainability of our civilization through technological applications, and to our understanding of the universe, are still a considerable undertaking to measure or to compute. Our objective is to unlock the applicability of ab initio predictions of nuclear collisions, which have been, so far, lagging behind that of static properties of nuclei. To reach this goal we aim:
1) To develop perturbation theory to ab initio reaction modeling, and by this means to open up to reacting systems above the p-shell;
2) To exploit the aforementioned development in the context of strict effective field theory for nucleons.
We expect these achievements to allow us to contribute to the understanding of the detailed balance between nucleons that will be uncovered at the edges of nuclear stability at facilities like Spiral2 in France and FAIR in Germany.
The experience researcher (ER) will bring to the host group its know-how in perturbative methods, of which he has been a
practitioner in nuclear structure, and, in doing so, he will boost the applicability of the host ab initio reaction tools. In turn, he will benefit from the supervisor’s expertise in reaction theory and effective field theoretical tools thereby acquiring a strong and valuable portfolio aiming to perform nuclear evaluation of data and predictions for supporting both theoretical and experimental nuclear astrophysics needs. In conclusion, this project is mutually beneficial to the host group and the ER. It will increase the ER visibility both at the EU and international levels, ready his managerial and mentoring skills for future career opportunities in academia or industry.",229211,2024,2026,European Commission,France; United States,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Comprehensive Cartography of the Circum-galactic medium Using aBsorption and Emission lineS in 3D datasets,"Galaxies form, grow and evolve by exchanging gas with their environment. Information about gas flows in and out of galaxies is encoded in their circumgalactic medium (CGM). Studying the CGM is therefore crucial to understand galaxy formation and evolution. However the detection of the CGM is challenging because of its low density. Historically, the CGM has been detected using absorption lines techniques providing only local information about the gas distribution and limited to rare cases where a bright source is in the background. Until very recently, the 2D mapping of the CGM was only possible for rare and massive nearby galaxies or required the use of, often criticized, stacking methods. The arrival of 3D spectrographs have revolutionized the study of the CGM by enabling the detection of low surface brightness diffuse gas. By leveraging the exquisite MUSE deep fields data, the C3UBES project aims at providing a comprehensive 3D-mapping of the CGM for an unprecedented statistical sample of distant galaxies. By exploiting the complementarity between absorption and emission line studies in the MUSE deep cubes as well as the magnification power of gravitational lensing, my project will shed light on the CGM gas content, its morphology and the gas kinematics around galaxies. Connecting the CGM to the host galaxy properties will help us understand how the CGM regulates galaxy growth. The unprecedented C3UBES sample will allow me to statistically study the evolution of this relationship over almost half the history of the universe. The excellence of the research environment at CRAL (host institute) and the expertise of my supervisor will give me the best opportunities to enhance and expand my career possibilities. Finally, coming back to Europe and increasing my national and European visibility thanks to the MSCA fellowship appear like the next logical steps to pursue my career.",229211,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Two-loop renormalization of the SMEFT and the WET,"The matching of the SMEFT onto the WET, i.e. expressing the WET parameters in terms of the SMEFT Wilson coefficients, is known since recently up to the one-loop level. These matching conditions depend however on unphysical entities and can therefore not be used in a consistent phenomenological analysis. In order to remove this scheme dependence the two-loop renormalization of the WET parameters needs to be taken into account, since it cancels this scheme dependence and therefore makes the results physical again. One objective of the current research project is to compute the full two-loop renormalization of the WET Wilson coefficients and implement the results in the public code wilson.  A second objective of the research project is to conduct the full two-loop renormalization for the SMEFT parameters. Performing the two-loop renormalization is motivated by the fact that at this order many more SMEFT Wilson coefficients become phenomenologically accessible through running effects, which therefore allows for a broader and more precise NP search. Another goal of this computation is again to remove unphysical dependencies that are present in the matching conditions. Although the full one-loop matching from general BSM theories onto the SMEFT is currently unknown, it is, however, expected to be available in the very near future. Together with the proposed calculation these matching conditions can then be used to perform a consistent and completely general NLO analysis of SMEFT parameters.",228170,2024,2026,European Commission,Switzerland,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Higher Order Parton Showers and Resummation to meet the High Luminosity LHC's accuracy goal,"With the upcoming high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the high energy physics community is gearing up to explore the fundamental building blocks of our universe with unprecedented precision. Consequently, the demand for precise and widely available theoretical predictions is at its highest level. Resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms plays a crucial role in achieving accurate phenomenological predictions, in addition to higher-order fixed-order predictions.
During my fellowship, I will to work on the design, implementation, and application of tools dedicated to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NNLL) resummation, including novel applications, as well as the first complete dipole parton shower with validated NNLL accuracy. Both represent critical tasks to meet the accuracy needs of the next phase of the LHC and of future collider experiments.
As a first step, I intend to extend the established CAESAR formalism for NLL resummation to NNLL, inside a comprehensive framework within the Sherpa event generator, one of the major simulation tools used by the LHC experiments. The Sherpa-CAESAR framework will then be extended to accommodate hadron collider environments like the LHC. The integration of this baseline for NNLL resummation serves as a foundation for the following efforts. 
Subsequently, I plan to enhance the recently introduced Alaric parton shower with inclusion of established Next-To-Next-To-Leading Order (NLO) splitting functions. Ultimately, I will utilise the tools and methods developed in the initial phase to validate the NNLL accuracy of the enhanced Alaric parton shower.
By the project’s conclusion, not only will a significant enhancement in NNLL resummation have been realised, but novel novel strategies for NLO subtraction and parton shower matching will emerge. This project stands to make a substantial contribution to the advancement of particle physics and the successful execution of experiments at the LHC and beyond.",228170,2024,2026,European Commission,Switzerland; United Kingdom,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
NUclear sTructure Evolution with LAser Spectroscopy,"The study of exotic atomic nuclei with extreme proton to neutron asymmetry is one of the pillars of contemporary nuclear physics and the study of the evolution of fundamental nuclear properties across the nuclear chart is one of its key aspects. In the last decades, many experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to the study of the disappearance of shell closures, often accompanied by an increase of configuration mixing and collectivity, leading to the formation of islands of inversion, where ground-states are found to have a deformed structure. The experimental study of such regions is of crucial importance for our understanding of the low-lying mechanisms generating these drastic structural evolutions, which poses serious challenges to nuclear theories. 
Ground-state properties are known to be a very sensitive probes to the nuclear wave function and to provide stringent test to nuclear theories. The Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (CRIS) experiment is a cutting-edge experimental setup located at ISOLDE/CERN, that perform laser spectroscopy on radioactive atomes in order to extract ground state properties. The present project aims at pushing ground-state nuclear properties measurements into the region of the N=40 island of inversion and near 78Ni, in order to benchmark nuclear theories (shell model, density functional theory and ab-initio) and to shed light on the low-lying mechanism responsible for drastic structural evolutions. Among the objectives of the project is the implementation of a decay spectroscopy station at CRIS that will allow to combine decay and laser spectroscopy techniques. This will offer unique opportunities for nuclear structure studies in the 78Ni region and has the potential to lead to several crucial discoveries.",228168,2024,2026,European Commission,Switzerland,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Pulsed power supply for the muon EDM experiment at PSI,"The Standard Model of particle physics is incomplete and e.g. cannot account for the origins of matter, dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses. Electric dipole moments (EDMs) of fundamental particles, which violate time reversal and parity symmetry, are a good test field for the search for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. Up to date, searches on EDMs for neutrons, atoms, and molecules (sensitive to quarks and leptons of the first generation) have found only null results. Hints for BSM physics as e.g. minimal flavor violation recently comes from the lepton sector.Ultimately, a currently forming new collaboration of 15 institutions aims at measuring the muon EDM (or at least putting an upper limit) at PSI. In a first phase, this project asks for funding for a pulsed (magnetic field) power supply needed for a demonstration experiment for the so-called frozen-spin method. Most of the funding to realize the experiment is secured through an ERC consolidator grant of the applicant. Using the demonstrator, the sensitivity for the muon EDM shall already be pushed to 3E-21 e?cm.Therefore, the experiment will provide (i) a roughly three orders of magnitude improvement of the muon EDM, (ii) a complementary search for an EDM of a bare lepton; (iii ) a unique test of lepton-flavor symmetries; and (iv) a stringent limit for otherwise very poorly constrained model parameters.",227792,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Geometric Classification Theory and Invariants of 4-Manifolds,"Classification of four-dimensional shapes, known in mathematics as manifolds, is a fundamental problem in geometry with deep connections to physics. An approach to studying manifolds called surgery theory, which has proved to be very fruitful in higher dimensions, involves cutting and re-assembling them from smaller parts which are easier to understand. A breakthrough in the 1980s showed that this theory holds for a certain type of four-dimensional manifolds. One of the goals of this project is to examine its validity in full generality. The project also aims to study symmetries of four-dimensional spaces, and to develop new tools for distinguishing them. Broader impacts of the project include research opportunities for undergraduate students, mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and outreach activities for middle school students. The PI will consider an approach to the 4-dimensional topological surgery conjecture for free non-abelian fundamental groups using a novel framework for the embedding problem of a collection of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in 4-space. The project will investigate properties of an invariant defined using the notion of a derived link of a handlebody. The PI will also consider another aspect of geometric classification theory, using pseudo-isotopy methods to study mapping class groups of both topological and smooth 4-manifolds. Another focus of the project is to study topological applications of a collection of invariants developed by the PI, based on ideas in stable homotopy theory and in link homology.

New Probes of Dark Sectors,"The Standard Model of particle physics has successfully described a wide range of experimental data. Nonetheless, cosmological measurements have shown that the particles described by the Standard Model correspond to only about 5% of the energy density in our universe, with the remaining 95% corresponding to dark matter and dark energy. Despite making up most of the energy density in the universe, very little is known about the dark components of the universe and their dynamics. Professor Marques-Tavares' research focuses on developing new ways to search for particles and forces in this dark sector of the Universe, leveraging data coming from accelerators, astrophysical observations, and cosmology. This research aims to shed new light on two central questions related to dark sectors: whether they have non-gravitational forces; and whether the dark matter energy density is made of multiple species of particles or just one. This work advances the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science. In addition, the PI will mentor graduate students and postdocs involved in this research, which contributes to the development of the national STEM workforce. The possible non-gravitational interactions of dark sector particles can be divided into two categories, they can either couple dark sector particles to the standard model or they can be forces that are confined to the dark sector. The PI will conduct a meticulous investigation of new signatures coming from theoretically motivated mediators of forces between the dark sector and the standard model in astrophysical objects, such as gamma-ray emissions following core-collapse supernovae, due to the decay of these mediators, and in cosmology, from late decay of mediator particles produced in the early universe. In addition, the PI will also determine the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to scenarios in which these mediators have larger masses and decay invisibly. To search for forces confined in the dark sector, the PI will study the impact of interactions of dark matter with other dark sector components on the cosmic microwave background and in observations of the large-scale structure of the universe.

Quantum Field Theory for Topological Phases of Matter,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Shu-Heng Shao at Stony Brook University. Symmetry has proven, time and again, to be the fundamental guiding principle in theoretical physics. Applications range from the spacetime symmetry in Einstein's theory of special relativity to the rotational symmetry in the quantum-mechanical description of the hydrogen atom and to the classification of the different phases of matter. Symmetry is one of the few universally applicable tools in analyzing quantum systems with strong interactions, and it often leads to far-reaching dynamical consequences. In recent years, the notion of symmetry has been generalized in several different directions, with interdisciplinary applications in high-energy physics, condensed-matter physics, mathematics, and quantum information theory. Professor Shao aims to develop a modern theoretical framework to discuss these new symmetries and uncover hidden symmetries in a diverse set of physical systems. Research along this line advances the national interest by reinforcing fundamental research in the United States and addressing one of the most fundamental and basic issues in the sciences, namely the role of symmetries. This project is also expected to have signiicant broader impacts. Professor Shao will mentor postdoctoral researchers through collaborations on proposed research projects. He also plans to give public lectures and organize summer schools based on his research. More technically, Professor Shao will focus on the interplay between three major kinds of generalized global symmetries: subsystem symmetries, higher-form symmetries, and non-invertible symmetries. Subsystem and higher-form symmetries are novel symmetries that do not act uniformly on the whole physical system, while non-invertible symmetries are associated with symmetry transformations that cannot be undone. Professor Shao will investigate these symmetries within the context of quantum field theory and lattice models. Within the context of subsystem symmetries, he will apply these symmetries to a new quantum phase of matter, the so-called ""fracton"" phase, and extend the framework of quantum field theory to describe the continuum limit of fractons. He will also study new anomalies associated with these generalized symmetries and derive nontrivial constraints on renormalization-group flows.

"Effective Field Theories, Machine Learning and New Physics","This award funds the research activities of Professor Zhengkang Zhang at the University of Utah. Our understanding of Nature at the most fundamental level is based on effective field theory (EFT), a theoretical framework that combines quantum physics, relativity, and the fact that Nature is organized by scales (little things affect big things, which in turn affect even bigger things). Agreement between EFT predictions and experimental data underlies the success of elementary particle physics, and has done so over the past century. However, theoretical puzzles remain, and many of them are associated with small numbers. The Higgs boson, for example, has a mass that is much smaller than our expectations from EFT reasoning. Recent studies have also revealed many more small-number mysteries in the form of surprising cancellations in EFT calculations of particle physics models. Under this award, Professor Zhang will develop new theoretical tools to resolve some of these mysteries, and exploit recent developments in machine learning (ML) to advance EFT calculations. Professor Zhang will also perform new calculations to better evaluate the discovery potential of ongoing experiments searching for dark matter. This project advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of new theoretical principles and discovery of new physical laws. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Zhang will build novel connections between EFT and ML which will improve our understanding of ML and promote more responsible use of artificial intelligence in many aspects of society. He will also involve students and postdocs in his research, thereby providing critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He will also engage in outreach activities to share his research with the public and increase scientific literacy. More technically, Professor Zhang will develop new EFT tools, including geometric and functional methods, and seek to explain “magic zeroes” (surprising cancellations) in EFT calculations involving higher-dimensional operators in the Standard Model (SM). He will, in particular, use functional methods to systematically investigate the conditions under which magic zeroes arise, and further develop geometric frameworks in which EFT amplitudes are covariant under general field redefinitions. This research will at the very least expand the phenomenologist toolbox which will enable us to better understand the structures of SMEFT (Standard Model EFT) and make more efficient use of SMEFT for physics beyond the Standard Model. Optimistically, this might also lead to new insights into the hierarchy problem. Meanwhile, Professor Zhang will thoroughly explore a nascent correspondence between neural networks and field theories, and develop novel ML-inspired approaches for field theory simulations. Finally, he will extend sub-GeV dark matter direct-detection calculations in order to better quantify halo uncertainties and directional sensitivity in phonon-based experiments.

Quantum Field Theory beyond the Vacuum,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Luca Delacrétaz at the University of Chicago. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of fundamental physics, unifying high energy, condensed matter, and statistical physics. It is also the most precise description we have of nature. This project aims to deepen our understanding of QFT beyond the relativistic vacuum traditionally studied in particle physics. The research will explore the behaviors and properties of matter under extreme conditions, such as high density and temperature, which are difficult to describe by existing methods. By investigating these states, the project seeks to uncover new principles of physics that could lead to advancements in various fields, including condensed matter physics and cosmology. Additionally, the research will involve the training of graduate students, and participation in outreach activities in Chicago's historically underserved south side, thereby supporting education and diversity in the sciences. This work aligns with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance national prosperity and welfare. More technically, the project is structured around two main objectives: constraining finite density phases that can emerge from interacting QFTs, and understanding the high-energy spectrum of QFTs through the lens of thermalization, hydrodynamics, and chaos. For the first objective, the research will employ UV/IR constraints and effective field theory (EFT) techniques to map out the possible phases that conformal field theories (CFTs) can flow to at finite density, aiming to either rule out or confirm the existence of exotic phases such as non-Fermi liquids, pair density waves, etc. For the second objective, the project will develop precision tests of thermalization by extending EFTs to capture hydrodynamic behavior and chaotic dynamics in high-energy states. This comprehensive approach aims to bridge the gap between high-energy theoretical predictions and observable phenomena in many-body quantum systems. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",225000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Condensed Matter Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Mesoscopic light-matter entanglement in hybrid solid-state networks,"Hybrid quantum systems couple together multiple distinct physical degrees of freedom. They are essential to the quantum technological revolution as, for instance, the light-matter coupling provides a way to transfer information from electronic to optical systems or vice versa. They also allow studying fundamental physics of quantum information.

I propose a theoretical project involving hybrid quantum networks consisting of coupled photonic and electronic systems. It will lead to a state-of-the-art blueprint for a quantum simulator and a set of new tools for understanding quantum mechanical entanglement in practice.

Currently, there are efforts to build quantum computers and simulators. These systems are often based on superconducting circuits or trapped ions with one type of a system: a qubit which is a two-level system. However, simulating modes with multiple levels, optical or vibrational systems for example, is inefficient with qubits. This project aims to provide novel theoretical tools for a hybrid quantum network that would fare better because it already contains optical modes. The theoretical tools developed combine condensed matter physics and quantum optics including phase-space methods.

I tackle the scientific objective in the following way: First, I focus on specific light-matter interactions of quantum dots and microwave cavities. I look into the smallest possible network of a quantum dot coupled to two cavities. In this simple network, I characterize the non-classical and non-local correlations of the two cavities, their entanglement, by studying the cross-correlations of the photons emitted by the cavities. Second, I expand the network by connecting quantum dots to the two cavities. This allows seeing the propagation of entanglement from the cavities to the terminating quantum dots. Finally, I extend the investigations to large hybrid networks which I will use for quantum simulation and to find new effective descriptions of entanglement propagation.",223946,2024,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Spin-dependent string fragmentation,"The fragmentation process is one of the most intriguing and poorly understood phenomenon of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It belongs to the non-perturbative domain of QCD and is usually described by process-independent fragmentation functions (FFs). Traditionally, non-perturbative effects in the fragmentation process related to the quark-spin degree of freedom have been neglected and only recently their importance has been brought to light by the discovery of the Collins effect in transversely polarized quark jets. Such effect, described by a new spin-dependent FF, is a polarimeter for the transverse polarization of the quark initiating the jet and is presently used to access the partonic structure of nucleons. This project is dedicated to the study of the spin-dependence of the fragmentation process in the framework of the recent string+3P0 model, an extension of the Lund Model reproducing the Collins effect and other effects observed in fragmentation, to the development of the model, and to its implementation in the PYTHIA8 event generator for the simulation of the electron-positron annihilation process in hadrons. The end goal is the introduction of spin-effects in the polarized fragmentation of arbitrary string configurations originated from the parton showering process. The implementation of the string+3P0 model in the PYTHIA8 generator will be achieved by extending the StringSpinner package, which will be used for the phenomenological description of the spin-dependent observables measured in electron-positron annihilation. The proposed project will bring to new insights on the spin-dependence of the fragmentation process and to a practical open access MC event generator program acting as a theoretical laboratory for the study of this process. On a longer term, the project is expected to lay the foundation for the systematic introduction of spin effects in the PYTHIA8 generator for other collision processes as well.",223946,2024,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
The Geometry of Higher Symmetries,"Symmetry structures are key to organizing the complexity of physical systems. In systems described by quantum field theories (QFTs) symmetries group observables, classify phases, determine selection rules and give insight into strongly coupled dynamics. They are irreplaceable in the study of phenomena such as confinement or duality. Recently, the notion of ‘symmetry’ in quantum field theories was understood to admit a substantial generalization to higher categorical structures such as n-groups and non-invertible symmetries. These realize further non-perturbative data yielding new handles in the study of QFTs. The goal of this project is to analyze such symmetry structures in geometrically engineered QFTs. We initially focus on theories in 4d parametrized by spectral curves and/or special holonomy spaces and aim to geometrize the symmetry representations and fusion structures related to their higher symmetries, building on both past work of the researcher and supervisor. This approach, unlike recent field theoretic developments, does not rely on a Lagrangian description of the QFT and therefore offers insight into confining properties and phase structures of strongly coupled systems. The foremost research objective of this proposal lies in charting these structures for increasingly less supersymmetric theories, including theories with no supersymmetry. All current evidence suggests that such symmetry structures only depend on topological data of the spectral curves and special holonomy space which we aim to trace through supersymmetry breaking deformations. Further research objectives include the study of analogous symmetry structures for superconformal theories in 5d and 6d. Such theories are intrinsically strongly coupled and the geometric methods developed in 4d, guided by field theory, come into their own as there are now no weak-coupling limits to extrapolate from.",223946,2024,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Physical Sciences
Manganese Nitride based sub-THz Ultra High Frequency Spin Hall Nano Oscillators,"Spin Hall nano-oscillators(SHNOs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their high frequencies, nanoscale size, ultra-fast/wide frequency tunability, and potential to replace CMOS-based oscillators. Here, an input current with spin hall effect is used to generate oscillations in a magnetic material ranging from a few hundreds of MHz to tens of GHz. As many existing and future radio protocols and applications will use frequencies well above 50 GHz, pushing the SHNO operating frequencies much higher would be of tremendous value. One way to increase the operating frequencies of SHNOs is by replacing the magnetic materials from ferromagnets to ferrimagnets. The magnetic properties of ferrimagnets make it a perfect candidate to be used for high frequency SHNOs. MANGA aims to use the Manganese Nitride (Mn4N) family of ferrimagnetic materials made up of light, abundant, cheap and greener elements to realise different types of SHNOs. It will demonstrate sub-THz ultra high frequency SHNOs followed by high frequency exchange spring oscillators by coupling the Mn4N system with other ferromagnetic materials such as Ni/NiFe/CoFeB. The Mn4N system will be studied as the spin source layer to generate oscillations in other magnetic layers. The first objective in MANGA of sub-THz ultra high frequency oscillators will be done by nanofabrication of nanoscale SHNO devices in Mn4N system which will be studied with the help of advanced optical techniques such as Brillouin Light Scattering(BLS) microscopy. For the next objective SHNO devices will be fabricated after the deposition of other magnetic layers on Mn4N layer and studied with various magnetic characterization techniques and BLS microscopy. For the last objective a Copper layer will be inserted between the Mn4N layer another magnetic layer. The spin source properties will be studied with the help of rectangular bar devices and oscillations will be studied with the SHNO devices.",223946,2025,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Extreme Ultraviolet Ptychographic Microscopy,"This project “Extreme ultraviolet ptychographic microscopy” (XUVPM) aims at improving the robustness and resolution of multispectral extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ptychography by realizing novel types of high divergence structured illumination in XUV spectral range. In this microscope, two-color generation of high-order harmonics from an industrial grade femtosecond laser will be employed to create structured illumination with controllable degree of orbital angular momentum (OAM) to be combined with ptychography. The high-repetition rate and high-average power femtosecond laser source will be temporally compressed with pulse post-compression and then split into two beams, the weaker beam is used to generate the second harmonic in a nonlinear crystal. This forms a two-color interferometer where each arm contains a spatial light modulator (SLM) to individually imprint OAM into each beam. Both beams are directed and focused into a noble gas jet in a non-collinear scheme to obtain high-order harmonics with controllable OAM. The OAM-HHG beam consisting of multiple harmonic orders is focused onto the sample by two toroidal mirrors in Wolter configuration. The sample is scanned transversely and at each scan position a CCD camera records the diffraction pattern. The generated XUV radiation will be optimized for its divergence and spatial properties, where the OAM can be controlled by the settings of the individual SLMs for the two generating colors.

The fundamental research on the described illumination technique will offer a chance to investigate the resolution limit of tabletop XUV microscopy, which further can address imaging science challenges associated with, e.g., the fabrication, synthesis, and integration of next-generation quantum and semiconductor devices. The work is supported by two experienced supervisors from complementary fields, covering the whole spectrum of the proposed project.",223945,2024,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Quantum Physics
Ultrafast optical Antiferromagnetic Topological Spintronics,"Antiferromagnetic spintronics exploits the antiferromagnetic (AFM) staggered magnetization-Néel vector to manipulate spin dependent transport properties in structures containing antiferromagnetic components. In ATOPS, I plan to use sub 15 fs light pulses to facilitate Neel vector reorientation via optically induced Neel spin orbit torque in the room temperature Dirac Nodal line AFM material MnPd2. The Neel vector reorientation in this material is also associated with changes in Fermi surface topology, where the orientation of the Neel vector controls switching between the degenerate and gapped Dirac states. MnPd2 with its favourable symmetry to support Néel spin orbit torque and the presence of Dirac Nodal lines in a broad range of energies across the Fermi level makes it an ideal candidate for topological AFM spintronics applications.  I will employ optical methods that are interesting in the sense that they can control the magnetization dynamics in ultrashort time scales with high spatial resolution. I will use magneto optical (MO) effects that are quadratic in magnetization and magneto-optical Voigt effect (MOVE) has been proposed to be an effective method to identify the Neel vector reorientation in the system.  Pump probe technique will be used to measure the MOVE signal in the fully compensated AFM - MnPd2 . ATOPS will also utilise magnetotransport techniques to characterise the material and verify the magnetic ordering. ATOPS plans to establish experimentally that the AFM Dirac material MnPd2 is an ideal system to realise strong response of magneto-transport and optical properties to the magnetization dynamics near room temperature.",223945,2025,2027,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Harnessing the Giant Orbital Hall effect for mutual synchronization in nano-oscillators,"Since its initial prediction, the spin Hall effect (SHE) has played a major role in spintronics thanks to its intriguing physics and tremendous potential for applications via the spin currents generated from charge currents. In the last few years, another phenomenon, the so-called orbital Hall effect (OHE), has also emerged. The OHE is the generation of pure orbital currents from the charge current, ushering in the era of orbitronics. The magnitude of the OHE is predicted to be 1-2 orders higher than the SHE, and therefore, it is imperative to harness it for the development of spintronic devices, e.g., to use it to excite auto-oscillations at microwave frequencies. Therefore, the Giant Orbital Hall Effect (GOHE) project aims at using the OHE instead of the SHE in spintronic nano-oscillators, to create a paradigm shift in the designing of next-generation orbitronics-based devices. Here, I propose a systematic study of different combinations of non-magnetic (NM)/heavy metal (HM)/ferromagnetic (FM) based heterostructures to harness the OHE and utilize it for the mutual synchronization of the world’s first orbital Hall nano-oscillators (OHNOs), to serve as a bridge to the already known capacity of spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) by the host group. Moreover, in this project, I aim to reliably elucidate the explicit contribution of bulk and interfacial OHE, in analogy with its counterpart, SHE. I will also study and unravel the fundamental mechanism OHE by disentangling the intrinsic and extrinsic contribution of scattering from impurities in host, and develop its background in line with SHE.",223945,2025,2027,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Establishing Lensed Supernovae as Probes to Address the Hubble Tension,"Lensed supernovae offer promising tools for cosmology with the upcoming revolutionary LSST survey, however the current techniques to both find these systems and to properly use them to infer the Hubble constant (H0) are severely underdeveloped. In this fellowship, I propose PHOLOS (Probing H0 with Lensing Of Supernovae), a three-part project to make lasting contributions to all steps of this process. I will first solve the longstanding problem of finding and prioritising lensed supernovae,  by simultaneous exploitation of multiple datasets to find lensed supernova canidates without spectroscopic follow-up. I will then address the issue of the mass distribution of lensing galaxies (a recent systematic worry in all time-delay cosmography studies), by modelling population level characteristics of a large sample of lensed quasars. Finally I will combine the new lensed supernovae and mass model constraints in a cosmological inference pipeline that will scale to the hundreds of systems with heterogeneous data quality expected from LSST, yielding a precise and accurate measurement of H0. The timing of this project is ideal as LSST will start collecting data in mid-2023. By expanding my knowledge and (transferable) skills, this project will prepare me to be world-leading researcher thanks to new expertise on specific datasets like LSST and Gaia, on analysis techniques and machine learning methods, and on astrophysical phenomena like supernovae, gravitational lensing, and galaxy mass profiles.",223941,2024,2026,European Commission,Sweden,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Differential Equations and the Geometry of Manifolds,"An important motivation for the research of the PI is to understand the relationship between the geometry and the topology of a space. The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less appealing that the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy. This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects supported by this award are to define appropriate energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy. The PI is committed to integrating research and education and cultivating intellectual development on many levels, and plans to continue to be active in outreach and organization of conferences and other events in the mathematics community. In more technical terms, the research of the PI is, broadly speaking, to use solutions of partial differential equations which are geometric in origin to study properties of differentiable manifolds. The main areas of concentration of the PI's research are the classification of gravitational instantons in dimension four, understanding Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Einstein metrics in the collapsing case, and the study of higher-dimensional complete non-compact Calabi-Yau structures. The PI has contributed to the classification of gravitational instantons in dimension 4, and plans to further investigate the global structure of the moduli spaces of these metrics. The PI has also contributed to the classification of asymptotically Calabi Calabi-Yau structures, and plans to study other types of complete non-compact Calabi-Yau structures in higher dimensions. The PI has contributed to the understanding of Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Calabi-Yau metrics on compact manifolds, and plans to further study global properties of compactifications of such moduli spaces.

National Nuclear Physics Summer School,"The National Nuclear Physics Summer School, held annually since 1988, is an effort by the nuclear physics community to acquaint students with the forefront issues of the field and with the experimental and theoretical methods available to nuclear physics researchers. The intent is to broaden student appreciation for and interest in the field, while also strengthening them technically. Typically most of the field's major directions are represented in the lectures: hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions, astrophysics, and nuclear structure. Advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers are the target audience. School organizers are charged with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who are interested in the current status of nuclear physics. School organizers are assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society. The school is often the first opportunity for students to recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across subfields. As such, the National Nuclear Physics Summer School represents a community-building activity that provides students with excellent opportunities to interact with leading researchers in the field and to network with their peers. Students leave the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge of their chosen specialties. As the lectures are preserved in an on-line archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during their subsequent training and research. Students are given a chance to present talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience.

Collaborative Research: Characterizing Energy Release and Flare Heating with High-Resolution Imaging and Spectral Observations and Modeling: Early DKIST Science,"Solar flares are believed to be powered by magnetic energy released rapidly through magnetic reconnection. The total emission of a flare lasts for tens of minutes, evolving from the so-called impulsive rise phase through the gradual decay phase. Emission at the feet of each of the individual flare loops also often exhibit an impulsive rise followed by a prolonged decay. The goal of this project is to unravel the physical mechanisms that heat the solar atmosphere during flares. The project will combine numerical modeling with analysis of spatially and spectrally resolved observations to advance the understanding of flare heating mechanisms. Two graduate students will conduct the observational analysis and flare modeling, which will comprise a major part of their thesis projects. An improved understanding of flare physics will lead to advances in the accuracy of space weather forecasting. High-resolution observations reveal that a flare is a collection of energy release and heating-cooling events characterized by a multitude of flare loops in the corona and their foot-points in the chromosphere, which occur from the impulsive through the decay phase of the flare. To date the mechanisms heating the flaring atmosphere are not clear. This project takes advantage of several methodologies, leveraging the efficiency of the UFC 0D global modeling and the advanced capabilities of 1D numerical codes. The team will apply the UV Foot-point Calorimeter method (UFC) to modeling and analyzing multi-wavelength observations of flares, yielding the first-order heating rates in multiple flare loops. They will then use those heating rates to drive a one-dimensional radiative transfer model (RADYN) to simulate flaring atmosphere along the loop and test a few heating mechanisms in different phases of flare evolution. The results will be used to synthesize flare spectra observed in the chromosphere to be compared with high-resolution observations by IRIS and DKIST. This project will advance both models, enhancing their utility and efficiency to model flares and therefore maximize the science output of the large amount of flare data.

Constraining dense nuclear matter with the dynamical tides of neutron stars,"The discovery of a merging binary neutron star in 2017, GW170817, marked an historic moment in the field of astronomy. This ground-breaking observation, witnessed by both electromagnetic- and gravitational-wave instruments, unveiled a wealth of scientific insights while capturing worldwide public attention.

Neutron stars, with their extraordinarily dense interiors, are Nature's laboratory for dense nuclear matter, about which very little is currently known. While in the past, electromagnetic observatories have been the primary sources of neutron-star observations, the emergence of gravitational-wave astronomy, epitomised by GW170817, has introduced a novel dimension to the observational effort. The forthcoming generation of gravitational-wave interferometers will possess even greater sensitivities, but their scientific impact will rely on meticulous design choices, along with the development of advanced data-analysis methods and robust physical models. This proposal, DynTideEOS, will address these critical needs and contribute to the science capability of these instruments at a critical time for design decisions.

DynTideEOS considers the dynamical tide, which drives the oscillation modes of the neutron star when the binary is closely separated. This project will identify the dominant modes in the gravitational wave, extract valuable constraints on the nuclear-matter equation of state and pioneer a state-of-the-art gravitational-waveform model for the dynamical tide.

Dr Fabian Gittins, with his outstanding background in theoretical astrophysics, joins forces with Prof Chris van den Broeck, a world-leading expert in gravitational-wave observations at Utrecht University. DynTideEOS not only promises original contributions to neutron-star astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy, while setting the stage for rich insights into nuclear physics, but will also underscore Dr Gittins's research excellence with a strengthened connection to observational physics.",220244,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Formation and evolution of habitable planets with seasons and tides,"Project PlaneTS is focused on one of the big questions of science: are we alone in the Universe? At this moment, we are urgently in need of improved models of the planet formation process in order to make reliable theoretical predictions. The needed improvement comes from recent studies that argue that the evolution of life on Earth depended on the presence of seasons and ocean tides, which have so far not been taken into account in astronomy. As these phenomena are caused by the tilt of Earth's rotation axis and our Moon, it is time to include planetary spins and satellite systems to the planet formation model. This big step forwards towards realistic models of habitable planets has been a major challenge, but has recently become feasible with the publication of my unique N-body code TIDYMESS, which solves the orbit, spin and tidal evolution of chaotically interacting planets and moons. With a novel approach for combining direct and secular integration methods, I will be able to obtain complete evolutions of ensembles of planet-moon systems and quantify the likelihood for planetary systems to produce a habitable planet with seasons and tides, i.e. Earth-Moon analogues. Three capture mechanisms will be studied in detail: tidal capture, few-body interactions with in-situ formed moons, and dynamical friction with planetesimals. The demographics of the ensemble will provide new insights into the formation of Earth-Moon analogues, while also quantifying their expected cosmic number density. The results will be used to derive a novel statistical method that can be used by the community to include the effects of planetary spins and satellite systems in other large-scale planet formation models. In conclusion, project PlaneTS represents a large step forwards in our understanding of the habitability of worlds by scrutinising the role played by seasons and tides.",220242,2025,2027,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Space Sciences
Dynamical Low Rank Methods for Multiscale Kinetic Plasma Simulations,"Plasmas consist of many charged particles, such as electrons and ions. The Boltzmann equation is often regarded as the first-principle model for plasmas; however, its numerical simulation is prohibitively expensive even on today’s most powerful supercomputers. The challenges manifest as: 1) High-dimensionality. The Boltzmann equation resides in six-dimensional phase space. Hence, full 6D deterministic simulation requires excessive computing effort and memory. 2) Collision operator. Collisions between particles are described by nonlinear, nonlocal integral operators that are extremely difficult to approximate. Yet, they play a critical role in driving the system towards local thermodynamic equilibrium and must be included in the simulation, especially in transition and fluid regimes. 3) Multiple scales. Plasmas inherently exhibit multiscale physics. Different scaling can lead to different asymptotic models. How to conduct efficient kinetic simulations such that multiscale behaviors are properly captured is a long-standing problem. The overall objective of this project is to develop a set of ultra-efficient deterministic numerical methods for multiscale kinetic plasma simulations. The algorithms to be developed in this project have the potential to provide high-fidelity kinetic plasma simulations across a range of regimes at a manageable computational cost. The basic framework we will employ is the dynamical low-rank method (DLRM), a robust dimension reduction technique for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. In essence, DLRM can be viewed as a time-dependent singular value decomposition; instead of solving the 6D equation, it tracks the dynamics of low-rank factors of the solution, which depend on either the three-dimensional position variable or the three-dimensional velocity variable, thus drastically reducing the computational cost and memory footprint. Our focus will be on the nonlinear collisional kinetic equations for plasmas, allowing us to address a broader range of regimes beyond the collisionless ones. We will design an efficient low-rank ansatz inspired by various asymptotic limits of plasma kinetic equations such that the method only requires a few ranks in the limiting regime and is as efficient as solving the reduced fluid models. We will also study the uniform stability and longtime behavior of DLRM rigorously, justifying the method's robustness for treating multiscale problems. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",220000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Information and Computing Sciences; Applied Computing; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Variational methods in singular geometry,"Many physical phenomena can be described by the principle of least action. This involves studying minima of certain functionals, called Lagrangians, named after the French mathematician and astronomer J-L Lagrange (1736-1813), that describe the energy of the system under consideration. For example, it is possible to derive Newton's laws of classical mechanics from the principle of least action. The principle can be applied also to more complicated systems, even infinite dimensional configuration spaces. One famous such example is the case of geodesics, paths minimizing the distance between two points in a smooth space. Another, more involved example is the case of harmonic maps. Here the Lagrangian energy is the total stretch of a map between two smooth spaces. In this project the PI proposes to study analogous situations for more complicated Lagrangians that have important applications. The project has also an educational component where the PI is planning to supervise graduate students towards their Ph.D. theses, undergraduates through seminar courses, and write expository notes for a wider audience. In slightly more technical terms, harmonic maps are critical points of the L-2 norm of the gradient (Dirichlet integral) of a map between two Riemannian manifolds. The PI proposes to study the calculus of variations of functionals associated with other function space norms like the L-infinity and L-1 norms. Minimizing functionals associated to the L-infinity norm yield solutions of fully non-linear degenerate elliptic PDE’s with very challenging regularity properties. Similarly, solutions of the dual non-linear problem for functionals involving the L-1 norm are equally challenging. The singular sets of these solutions provide geometric realizations of topological objects, like geodesic foliations and laminations, studied in topology. The PI proposes to develop the analytic methods to study these topological objects as well as others studied in Thurston theory. Examples are earthquakes and cataclysms. There is very little known in the literature about the analytic underpinnings of the theory so the PI has to develop most of the techniques from scratch.

Splicing Summation Formulae and Triple Product L-Functions,"This award concerns the Langlands program which has been described as a grand unification theory within mathematics. In some sense the atoms of the theory are automorphic representations. The Langlands functoriality conjecture predicts that a collection of natural correspondences preserve these atoms. To even formulate this conjecture precisely, mathematical subjects as diverse as number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics are required. In turn, work on the conjecture has enriched these subjects, and in some cases completely reshaped them. One particularly important example of a correspondence that should preserve automorphic representations is the automorphic tensor product. It has been known for some time that in order to establish this particular case of Langlands functoriality it suffices to prove that certain functions known as L-functions are analytically well-behaved. More recently, Braverman and Kazhdan, Ngo, Lafforgue and Sakellaridis have explained that the expected properties of these L-functions would follow if one could obtain certain generalized Poisson summation formulae. The PI has isolated a particular family of known Poisson summation formulae and proposes to splice them together to obtain the Poisson summation formulae relevant for establishing the automorphic tensor product.

"Sectional Curvature, Isotropic Curvature, and Curvature Operators","Curvature serves as a fundamental concept in geometry. Intuitively, it measures the amount by which a space deviates from being flat. A central topic in geometry is to investigate how various positivity conditions on the curvature tensor restrict the shape of the underlying space. This project delves into a variety of curvature conditions under different geometric settings, aiming to deepen our understanding of the topological implications. Additionally, the project extends its impact beyond research by fostering engagement with K12 students through Math Circle and AMC (American Math Competition) 8 activities in Wichita region in Kansas, alongside mentorship programs for undergraduate and graduate students. This project unfolds through three research objectives. The first one is an in-depth investigation of the curvature operator of the second kind, which gained attention following the recent resolution of Nishikawa’s 1986 conjecture by Cao-Gursky-Tran and the PI. The goal is to classify Riemannian and Kahler manifolds with k-positive curvature operator of the second kind. The second explores Ricci flows with positive isotropic curvature, aiming toward a classification of compact manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. The third objective entails an investigation of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons and Einstein four-manifolds with positive sectional curvature, aiming to make progress toward two folklore conjectures. Primary strategies include finding new Ricci flow invariant cones, studying the evolution of various curvature under Ricci flow, analyzing partial differential equations satisfied by various geometric quantities, and understanding the relationship between various notions of curvature via tensor algebra and Lie algebra. This project is jointly funded by Topology and Geometric Analysis Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

The theory of surfaces in geometry and relativity,"This project utilizes powerful geometric concepts, known as classical surface theories, to unlock the mysteries of spacetime. This research will deepen our understanding of gravity, black holes, and the very fabric of spacetime. The project's findings can complement experimental data on phenomena like gravitational waves, currently heavily reliant on numerical simulations. Novel methods developed during this research might find applications in other areas of mathematics and physics. The research in this project will also promote interests in mathematics among undergraduate and graduate students and young researchers in the mathematical community. This project leverages the power of classical surface theories, including techniques like isometric embedding and the Gauss map, to investigate complex problems in differential geometry and general relativity. By focusing on the non-linear nature of spacetime, the research aims to:1.Evaluate the quasi-local mass of binary black holes: Develop a more precise method for calculating the combined mass and individual masses of these fascinating objects.2.Define angular momentum in general relativity: Establish a rigorous definition of angular momentum applicable to global solutions of Einstein's equations.3.Prove existence and regularity of a geometric flow: Mathematically demonstrate the existence and well-behaved nature of a specific type of geometric evolution. 4. Demonstrate duality in string theory: Reveal an underlying connection between two seemingly disparate equations within string theory, potentially leading to new avenues of exploration. These advancements promise to significantly contribute to our understanding of the universe and the power of mathematics in unraveling its mysteries.

"Foams, Categorification, and Link Homology","Topology and geometry in low dimensions differ significantly from those in the stable, high-dimensional, range. One feature of low dimensions is the existence of deep structures known as TQFTs (Topological Quantum Field Theories), many originating in quantum physics and having applications to condensed matter, statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The Prinicipal Investigator will be studying such topological theories of more general type, where the theory is known on topological objects without boundary (closed objects) and extended canonically to objects with boundary. These constructions proved fruitful for explicit combinatorial construction of link homology theories, where topological objects are foam-like two-dimensional structures embedded in 3-space. The author has recently shown that a semi-linear version of this construction in dimension one extends so-called finite state automata and regular languages, which is a classical subject in computer science. This opens possibility of many generalizations, including exploring connections between more general languages and topological theories and possible relations between two-dimensional theories and cellular automata. Further studies of topological theories and related topics of foams and link homology should lead to fruitful discoveries in low-dimensional topology and related fields. More specifically, the project has three major goals. The first major goal is to further develop the theory of foams, their evaluations and applications in link homology and categorification. Foams are two-dimensional CW-complexes with generic singularities. They have proved instrumental in combinatorial approaches to GL(N) link homology theories and boast tantalizing connections to instanton Floer homology for orbifolds. The PI will further develop topological theories related to foams, with an eye towards technically difficult problems, such as computation of Kronheimer-Mrowka homology of embedded trivalent graphs and finding combinatorial counterpart of that homology. The second goal is to find approaches to several link homology theories, including Cautis, Webster and Qi-Sussan homologies, to establish their functoriality and extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. A number of important link homology theories, including triply-graded HOMFLYPT homology, Webster, Cautis, and Qi-Sussan homology, are missing a functorial extension to tangle cobordisms and, in most cases, a related extensions to tangles. The PI will develop new approaches to these homology theories to redefine them, repair functoriality where necessary, and extend them to link cobordisms. The third goal is to understand universal theories in low dimensions. The PI will continue studying universal construction of topological theories, motivated by recent successes such as the interpretation of finite state automata and regular languages via one-dimensional topological theories with defects and taking values in the Boolean semiring B, where a regular language and a circular regular language give rise to a rigid symmetric monoidal B-linear category.

Investigating Quantum Phases at Extreme Charge Doping Limit by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy,"Tailoring electronic properties of quantum matter is of immense current interest in the condensed matter physics community. The ability to control quantum states benefits both fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and the advancement of next-generation quantum techniques. Recently, ionic gating has emerged as a powerful tool in manipulating electronic states by achieving ultra-high doping levels. However, this technique has not been applied to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies, which are crucial in accessing the local density of electronic states and exploring correlated phases. 

I will establish a new STM technique that integrates ionic gating (SIG-STM) to manipulate quantum states through ultra-high carrier density doping. SIG-STM will open a completely new window to study highly doped correlated materials at the atomic level. 1. I will fabricate the nano-devices that can reach ultra-high doping levels through ionic gating and are compatible with low-temperature STM. 2. I will carry out STM studies on the devices to demonstrate the technique of SIG-STM. 3. I will combine SIG-STM and molecular beam epitaxy to study versatile and low-dimension materials. 

This project combines the strengths of both the experienced researcher and the host group. Our new SIG-STM technique combines our expertise in the fabrication of high-quality devices (from myself) and STM measurements (from the host group). SIG-STM will be a breakthrough in condensed matter physics that can contribute to long-lasting problems such as the origin of high-temperature superconductivity. In addition, SIG-STM has great potential to expand understanding of new functional materials such as dissipationless materials and advanced electronics in quantum technologies with strong societal and potentially economic impact.",216158,2025,2026,European Commission,Finland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Sub-Nanoscale Observation of Magnetic Monopole Noise,"The magnetic version of the electron, the Dirac magnetic monopole, although predicted to exist, has yet to be discovered. Recently, the search for emergent magnetic monopoles in quantum materials has focused on spin-ice compounds, which host magnetic monopoles as emergent quasiparticles. Even though emergent monopoles have been studied using the toolbox of quantum matter research, the long awaited monopole detection is still lacking because of the limited low spatial resolution probes and temperature range of the experiments. In this proposal, I present a plan to develop a novel concept called Scanned Spin-Noise Microscope (SSNM) and provide a cutting-edge instrument for realising a Sub-Nanoscale Observation of MAgnetic monopole Noise (SNOMAN). The SSNM will be designed to operate in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator to slow down the monopole dynamics and realise the long-awaited single monopole detection. I aim to undertake this project under the supervision of Prof. Seamus Davis at University College Cork, where all the necessary facilities and expertise are available to achieve the objectives described in this proposal.",216158,2024,2026,European Commission,Ireland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Quantum lock-in amplifier phonon detectors,"The precise measurement of phononic properties of materials is crucial for the emerging physics and next-generation technologies. With the ever-growing study of phononic many-body physics, the need for precise phonon measurement has become increasingly important. Quantum lock-in measurement techniques offer a promising avenue for future phonon detection, boasting significant advantages such as ultra-high resolution, heightened sensitivity, and the capability for concurrent measurement of amplitude, frequency, and phase.
In this project, I propose innovative quantum lock-in amplifier phonon detector (Q-LAMP) for phonon detection for the first time and plan to experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness in simultaneously measuring phonon phase, frequency, and amplitude. I plan to use Q-LAMP to measure topological localized states in phononic crystals and can also be employed for detecting weak microwaves. The quantum lock-in amplifier developed in this project will pushing both phononics physics and wireless communication to new stage.

Understanding kilonova diversity using radiative transfer simulations with realistic binary neutron star merger ejecta,"The merging of binary neutron stars produces an explosive kilonova transient, recently confirmed by the first ever detection of a kilonova, AT2017gfo, coincident with a gravitational wave signal, GW170817. The wealth of observations provided by AT2017gfo offers the opportunity to probe the fundamental physics of binary neutron star mergers, including the incompletely known Equation of State of dense nuclear matter and rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process), which produces half of all elements heavier than iron in the Universe. With the detection of AT2017gfo and the new gravitational wave observing run of LIGO, VIRGO and KAGRA (O4) the demand for kilonova simulations has never been so great.

The aim of this research is to produce sophisticated, three-dimensional kilonova radiative transfer simulations from binary neutron star merger ejecta with detailed r-process calculations, allowing simulations to be directly compared to observations. I am uniquely placed to combine these complex simulations to self-consistently model kilonovae, enabling powerful constraints to be placed on the underlying physics through interpreting kilonova observations. I will carry out the first three-dimensional kilonova parameter space study based on realistic hydrodynamical neutron star merger simulations with a range of neutron star masses and Equations of State. The simulations will predict spectra using a state of the art line-by-line opacity treatment for millions of line transitions of r-process elements, which allows spectral features to be directly associated with the ions responsible for forming the features.

This multi-disciplinary approach will constrain and improve hydrodynamical neutron star merger modelling, kilonova radiative transfer simulations, the high density Equation of State and r-process nucleosynthesis, which are critical to move our knowledge of kilonovae and their role in producing heavy elements in the Universe beyond the state of the art.",216157,2024,2026,European Commission,Ireland,EU,Astronomical Sciences
"Boltzmann models for polyatomic gases and mixtures: analysis, macroscopic limits and entropy methods","BAME is a project in applied mathematics tackling problems in kinetic theory of gases. We will focus on the system of Boltzmann-like equations that describes gas mixtures composed of monatomic and polyatomic gases. Experience has shown that kinetic models accurately describe strong nonequilibrium processes in gas flows. However, most of the mathematical theory is limited to the oversimplified case of a single monatomic gas. Our aim is to contribute in filling this gap between study of more intrigant gases suitable for applications and the current state of the art in mathematical theory of kinetic equations. Objectives are to study regularizing effects of the Boltzmann operator, integrability, smoothness and strict positivity of solutions, with the ultimate goal of encoding large time behavior using entropy methods. The project will bring together the researcher with distinguished expertise in modelling and analysis of polyatomic gases and mixtures at the mesoscopic level and the host with ground-breaking work on entropy methods for macroscopic systems. The two levels of descriptions will be bridged formally through hydrodynamic limits at the secondment, leading to the redesign of entropy production program to the system of interest. The fellowship will enable the researcher to gain new analytical skills and greatly improve transferable skills through the reach training offer at the host University of Graz. Moreover, it will significantly extend her research network and facilitate participation in leading events in the field, leading to the capability to launch her own research group in the future and to enhance the career perspectives in academia.",215886,2025,2027,European Commission,Austria; Portugal,EU,Classical Physics
Quantum many-body optics in structured low-dimensional systems,"Understanding the propagation of light and how it interacts with matter is important in many areas of science and technology. While photons are ideal carriers of information due to their lack of mutual interactions, the ability to induce large optical non-linearities in optical media opens up exciting perspectives for fundamental research and quantum information applications. Interfacing light with individual quantum emitters has made it possible to reach remarkably strong non-linearities on the level of individual photons, which can generate correlated quantum states of light. Structured systems of regularly arranged emitters offer a unique platform with enhanced coherent light-matter coupling and highly suppressed photon losses. However, recent work has so far mostly been limited to the study of linear optics. 

QuLowD will explore the quantum nonlinear optics of structured emitter arrays in two complementary systems: arrays of ultracold atoms in optical lattices and arrays of long-lived excitons in twisted multi-layer structures of quantum materials. The ambition of QuLowD is to contribute to our theoretical understanding of emergent photon interactions in such novel optical interfaces from the regime of few interacting photons to the many-body physics under strong optical driving. Through close collaborations between two research group led by Thomas Pohl at TU Wien, and associated groups at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (ITP) and the Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology (VCQ),  QuLowD seek to combine concepts from quantum optics and atomic physics as well as theoretical solid-state physics to advance the understanding of both of these systems. In particular, I will investigate few-body physics of exciton arrays in 2D quantum materials, develop methods to explore the many-body physics of atomic arrays and investigate strongly interacting polaritons in twisted multi-layer structures.

Beyond the scope of the fellowship, QuLowD will contribute to the advancement of future quantum information applications based on light-matter interfaces.",215885,2024,2026,European Commission,Austria,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Old anD Young Star clusterS tracing Evolution and assemblY,"In the standard framework of galaxy evolution, galaxies form in a two-phase scenario that comprises a quasi-monolithic formation of an in-situ population, followed by the accretion of of lower-mass galaxies. As these merger processes significantly alter the morphology and kinematic state of a galaxy, reconstructing the assembly history of galaxies is a challenging but fundamental task to understand galaxy evolution. In that context, dense star clusters such as globular clusters, young massive clusters, and nuclear star clusters, that still contain  information of their birthplace and subsequent evolution imprinted in their stellar population are potentially powerful tracers of galaxy assembly. While ancient globular clusters are fossil records of early star formation and galaxy accretion, young massive star clusters trace recent star formation episodes and interactions, and nuclear star clusters provide an unique window into the evolution of a galaxy's central region. The ODYSSEY action aims to fully unlock the potential of these star clusters as tracers of galaxy evolution by employing a comprehensive framework that combines for the first time the insights provided by globular clusters, young massive clusters and nuclear clusters. To achieve this, ODYSSEY has two main objectives: 1) exploring the complex interplay between galaxies and the star clusters they host and b) constructing a flexible semi-analytical model that constrains the assembly history of individual galaxies from their star clusters. The proposed research programme will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that shape star clusters and of how they are connected to the evolution of their host galaxies, while at the same time providing a new methodology of how galaxy evolution can be studied.",215885,2024,2026,European Commission,Austria,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Unveiling the structural architecture of skin layers through cryo-electron microscopy,"The skin is the largest organ of the human body. It has a variety of functions and it is organized in three different layers, the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, all three of which have a different anatomy and function. The epidermis itself is also composed of several layers divided from the inside to the outside and these layers illustrate the various stages of keratinocyte differentiation, which is the process by which the basal layer proliferates and produces new cells that will differentiate towards the skin’s surface. Skin integrity is maintained by the relationship between keratinocytes and the specialized matrix of lipids they are embedded in. This project will use state-of-the-art cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy lift-out milling and cryo-electron tomography of natively preserved skin tissue to obtain insights into the ultrastructural organization of the epidermis. More specifically we aim to describe and quantify how the keratin microfilaments network is arranged throughout the skin layers and contributes to skin resilience and strength, and in what way this organization is correlated to the lipid formation and delivery. Our initial results reveal new insights into the architecture of the outermost skin layers, specifically their intermediate filaments organization and lipid layer organization to provide strength and separation between different cell layers, respectively. ISTA is the ideal research institute for this project, due to the abundant access to high-end electron microscopes necessary for this project achievement. The outcome of this will be a high resolution in situ structure architecture that will allow a better understanding of skin homeostasis. Results will be disseminated through key research conferences and high-impact open-access publications. Communication activities will be achieved through 3D rendered visual scientific illustrations targeting social media platforms and institute-organized public outreach events.",215885,2024,2026,European Commission,Austria,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Theory of Atoms,"Algebraic varieties are shapes defined by solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. A fundamental problem in geometry is the classification of algebraic varieties, as it helps us gain a better understanding of the structures and relations between them. The first step in classification is called birational classification, i.e. two algebraic varieties are called birational if they are equal outside some lower-dimensional loci. In this proposal, the PI will investigate new birational invariants, atoms, based on foundations coming from theoretical physics. The theory of atoms has its origin in conformal field theory and homological mirror symmetry. This project will also support training of early-career mathematicians and dissemination events through the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of Americas in the University of Miami. More specifically, the PI’s approach in birational geometry is based on developing a new singularity theory of Landau-Ginzburg models and a non-commutative refinement of the notion of an eigenspectrum of quantum multiplication operators. These new non-commutative spectra provide natural obstructions to rationality and equivariant rationality of Fano varieties. This could lead to even stronger birational invariants as well as to new unexpected bridges, including: a new connection between Steenbrink spectra of the LG models and asymptotics of quantum differential equations; new birational applications of atoms to the cases of singular varieties and the case of varieties over algebraically non closed fields; and a new relation between non-Kahler manifolds, their Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) and their atoms.

New Perspectives in Heegaard Floer Homology,"A fundamental question in topology is whether we can deform one shape into another while preserving certain intrinsic properties. By adding a time dimension, it is natural to think of the deformation as being a 4-dimensional object which has one object at one end, and the other shape at the other end. A fundamental question in low-dimensional topology is whether we can build a 4-dimensional space which connects two given 3-dimensional objects. Heegaard Floer homology is an important tool for studying such questions. It gives topologists a way of knowing that two 3-dimensional spaces cannot be related by a 4-dimensional space. Heegaard Floer homology involves the counts of complicated solutions to differential equations and has deep connections to Seiberg-Witten theory, Yang-Mills theory, and mathematical physics. This project aims to develop new tools for computing Heegaard Floer homology. A main focus of this project is to develop a new minus version of bordered Heegaard Floer homology for 3-dimensional spaces with torus boundary components. This theory is based on the link surgery formula of Manolescu and Ozsváth. The project aims to use this theory to study the lattice homology conjecture of Némethi. Additionally, the project aims to study symmetries in this theory and in the link surgery formula. With these tools, the PI hopes to give computable invariants of homology cobordism. In addition, the PI endeavors to mentor graduate students and undergraduates, as well as organize events to disperse knowledge.

RadioForegrounds+: Unveiling the complexity of radio foregrounds for the detectability of the CMB polarization B-mode,"One of the main challenges in Cosmology is the detection of the primordial B-mode of CMB polarization, which would constitute a confirmation of the inflationary period of the Universe. However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions. RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources. It will also provide an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This goal can only be achieved by combining the ESA’s Planck satellite maps (30-857GHz) with the unique low frequency experiments considered in this proposal: QUIJOTE (10-40 GHz), C-BASS (5 GHz) and S-PASS (2.3 GHz), by counting within the consortium with experts on the previous data sets (including the teams responsible for QUIJOTE and C-BASS) and by using the most advanced analysis techniques. The combination of these datasets will provide highlevel data products, that will range from more complete radio catalogues, including fainter sources and additional frequency coverage, to new component separated maps in wider regions of the sky. These new data products and models will be made available to the scientific community through widely-used platforms, increasing the scientific return and the impact of the project. We will also provide forecasts of the impact of radio foregrounds on the detectability of the B-mode of polarization for future CMB experiments. The resulting analyses will play a key role in preparing and supporting future international CMB missions as LiteBIRD or ground-based efforts as CMB-S4.",212528,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Dynamics and REplica Analysis of Monitored Systems,"The DREAMS (Dynamics and REplica Analysis of Monitored Systems) project aims to understand the physics of monitored quantum systems, i.e., many-body systems that periodically undergo a series of repeated 
local measurements. The competition between the monitoring and the unitary dynamics, which respectively favor and hinder the building up of non-local quantum correlations, can give rise to a measurement-induced 
phase transition. Such a transition can be detected, for example, by looking at the growth of the entanglement of a subsystem or the purification time-scale of an initially mixed state.
As entanglement is a central quantity in quantum information, a complete understanding of the dynamics of monitored systems and their critical behavior would have significant consequences both at the theoretical 
level and in the development of quantum technologies—such as error correction and quantum control via feedback. To this end, a replica approach has been recently proposed. This has the advantage of framing the 
evolution of the system in terms of linear equations, at the price of introducing the need for an analytic continuation of our results.
DREAMS is divided into three parts. First, the dynamics of some fully-connected models will be investigated through the replica formalism. As the physics of these models is dominated by mean-field effects, it is 
possible to derive exact analytic solutions and understand the conditions under which critical behavior could emerge. Then, more realistic, finite-range interacting systems will be taken into account to probe the 
validity of our predictions in the presence of a spatial modulation of the coupling. An extensive numerical activity will be carried out to test our prediction. Finally, these results will be reinterpreted in light of 
the existing theoretical frameworks for monitored systems, trying to extract general predictions.",212066,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
"Non-Lorentzian Geometry in Gravity, String Theory and Holography","In this project, I will develop modern theoretical tools for non-Lorentzian geometry to advance our understanding of gravity and holography. Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravity in terms of the curvature of a Lorentzian spacetime geometry. A similar geometric description of non-relativistic Newtonian gravity has been known for a long time. However, we have only recently figured out how the dynamics of such Newton-Cartan geometry can be extracted from a systematic expansion of general relativity. This gives a new and exciting approach to extracting predictions from general relativity using a geometric interpolation.
I have done fundamental work on such geometric expansions of general relativity, both in the Newton-Cartan and in the opposite Carroll limit, which similarly leads to solvable subsectors. In this project, I will develop an initial-value formulation for the resulting actions and I will show that the associated initial-value problem is well-posed, opening a path to numerical simulations. Using similar limits in string theory, I will establish new solvable sectors of string theory on negatively curved spacetime that are relevant to top-down models of the holographic correspondence.
On the other hand, in the astrophysically relevant setting of approximately flat spacetime, holography is much less understood, in part because of the null structure on its boundary. The supervisor (Prof. Marios Petropoulos) and myself have developed complementary approaches to constructing Carroll field theories on such null boundaries. Building on this, I will construct concrete dual field theory models, which will allow me to make contact with the celestial holography program of which Prof. Puhm is a world expert. The Centre de Physique Théorique at École Polytechnique is therefore the perfect place for me to unify these approaches to flat space holography and to work towards explicit constructions of top-down string theory models.",212066,2024,2026,European Commission,France; France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Fireball Luminosity Applied to probe the Meteoroid Environment,"With thousands of new asteroids and comets discovered each year, the study addresses the consequences of their disintegration due to rotational fission, collisions, and cometary activity. These processes yield meteoroids, which, upon entering Earth's atmosphere, create a range of phenomena called meteors or fireballs (in the case of large impacts). As the number of space missions grows, the threat posed by meteoroid impacts increases. The objective of this research is directly relevant to safeguarding our current and future space-based infrastructure, aligning the project with European science priorities in the realm of cosmic exploration and Earth surveillance.
During this project we will investigate the fireballs detected by modern digital camera networks such as FRIPON, to estimate the risk of impact according to the meteoroid size given an area and a time interval. This endeavor has started during my PhD, working on a small data set, calibrating measurements obtained by the network in Romania, and devising new techniques in analyzing this type of data. 
This work will shed light on the size of meteoroids which are able to generate fireballs by measuring the pre-entry mass, and accounting for observational bias. Thus, the results will improve the estimates of mass accreted by the Earth, better assess the space probes risk of colliding with different meteoroid populations, leading to proper protection. FLAME will also include a meteoroid mass forecast assigned to each meteor shower, available as an open web-based service on the Paris Observatory, IMCCE website.
Moreover, the research's findings will fine-tune interdisciplinary methods like infrasound and seismic analyses to be cross-calibrated from the data obtained in this project, in order to estimate the meteoroid impact energy. Ultimately, by advancing our understanding of the meteoroid population, this study will provide the data for a more effective space navigation and development.",212066,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Earth Sciences; Geology; Space Sciences
from Generalised hydrodynamics to new Effective descriptions of NonEquilibrium quantum SYStems,"Understanding the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems is one of the main challenges of the Physics of the 21st century. Despite the complexity of the field, significant steps forward have been achieved thanks to the parallel development of advanced theoretical tools, numerical methods and experimental verifications made with ultracold atoms and ions. In this context, Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) represented a fundamental breakthrough which permitted the use of new integrability-based techniques to include previously untreatable experimental effects such as spatial inhomogeneities and temperature gradients. But from this milestone, new questions inevitably arise for which the proposed action stands as a targeted plan of investigation. On the one hand, a known weakness of any hydrodynamic approach is the loss of long-range quantum fluctuations. Although a few attempts to include quantum effects in the formulation of GHD are present, a definitive answer to this problem is still far. On the other hand, the advent of GHD indirectly revived the interest in diffusive models, with the ultimate goal of developing a quantum analogue of the celebrated Macroscopic Fluctuations Theory. In detail, by combining analytical and numerical methods,  the proposal aims the fulfilment of three objectives within this landscape, consisting of research and training activities dedicated to i) investigating the quantum corrections of GHD and clarifying the connections among the available theories, aiming at a single description of quantum ballistic transport ii) exploit the developments in quantum ballistic transport to describe currently feasible measures of the correlations of quantum gases out-of-equilibrium iii) connect ballistic to diffusive quantum transport, starting from simple settings. Altogether, these packages represent a fundamental step in the understanding of the emergent hydrodynamic descriptions of non-equilibrium quantum systems.",212066,2024,2026,European Commission,France; France; France; United Kingdom; France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Random Matrix and Integrable Systems,"The main topic of this proposal is the study of the Statistical Mechanics of Integrable systems, a particular class of dynamical systems for which the behaviour is fully predictable from the initial data. All relevant information about the dynamics is encoded in a particular matrix L, called Lax matrix. We want to compute the maximum amplitude for the solution of the Ablowitz-Laddik lattice, and the correlation functions for the Volterra lattice, and the Exponential Toda one. The first quantity is instrumental to study the phenomenon of rouge waves formations, and the second one to compute transport coefficients of specific lattices. To compute these quantities, we need to obtain the distribution and the fluctuations of the eigenvalues of the Lax matrix when the initial data are sample according to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble, thus the Lax matrix becomes a random matrix. To study these objects, we use Large Deviations principles. Furthermore, we also considered the focusing Ablowitz--Laddik lattice, the focusing Schur flow, and the family of Itoh--Narita--Bogoyavleskii lattices. The eigenvalues of the Lax matrices of these systems, when the initial data is sample according to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble, lay on the complex plane. We plan to compute the density of states, and the joint eigenvalues distribution of the random Lax matrices by using the Inverse Scattering Transform, that is a canonical transformation between the physical variables and the spectral variables of the Lax matrices, the Hermitization technique and the Brown measure characterization. In the end, thanks to this analysis, we will be able to define some new random matrix ensembles on the complex plane, for which it is possible to compute the eigenvalues’ distribution, and the joint eigenvalues’ density explicitly. So, we will define some new beta-ensembles.",212066,2024,2026,European Commission,France; France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics
Tayloring Decoherence in Large Molecules,"Large molecules, i.e. molecules with more than 10 or even 20 atoms, have a huge potential to provide new data for the elaboration of new physics, from probing dark matter models, variations of fundamental constants or testing the Standard Model beyond what can be achieved by high-energy experiments conducted at large and very costly facilities. However, these large molecules can suffer from very complex couplings, making high-precision measurements almost impossible once a certain number of atoms, and thus of molecular complexity, is reached. When probing vibrations of the molecule (spectroscopically, in the IR frequency domain), couplings between different vibrational modes of the same molecule can induce large linewidths, and decoherence of the vibrational states. These vibrational couplings are called intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) in the physical chemistry litterature, and are known since more than 40 years, but a detailed understanding of these processes is still lacking. Progress in that field is thus of paramount importance for the development of new experiments involving large molecules for the advancement of physics, and for the understanding of how vibrational energy is stored and can flow in a molecule.

The project will explore experimentally IVR in large molecules with cutting-edge spectroscopic tools, to progress in removing this major blockade in the use of large molecules to look for new physics. Probing IVR in a very detailed way is enabled by recent advances in the production of cold molecules and ultra-high-resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy. These new techniques will allow me to develop and demonstrate a new methodology to study IVR at an unprecendented precision. The main output will be a recipe to tailor IVR in molecules, from the molecular structure point-of-view, as well as the demonstration of unparalleled spectroscopic resolution on molecules with more than 20 atoms.",212066,2025,2026,European Commission,France; France,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Single Photon Emission Enhancement by Deterministic Bottom Up Manufacturing of Plasmonic nanoStructures,"Quantum information represents a paradigm-shift in the way we exchange information, with the EU and the US investing substantial economic resources on basic research and technological developments. Propelled by these efforts, the research community intensely worked on physical sources of quantum bits, qubits, the quantum information basic units. In particular, Single Photon Sources (SPS) offer the perspective of modular quantum information circuitry elements. In this framework, transition from fundamental research to technology is a necessary step towards their use in a broader and application-oriented use.
SPEEDBUMPS will develop plasmonic-enhanced tapered optical nanofibers (ONF), a highly reliable SPS generation and collection system exploiting on-waveguide localized plasmon surface resonances to generate periodic flows of single photons on a ready-for-integration waveguide with enhanced optical properties.
To do this it will pursue three main objectives to surpass the current state-of-art of fiber-based SPS: 
1. Exploiting SPS typically requires bulky optical setups, limiting the translation in applicative frameworks where no strong expertise in optical systems is required. SPEEDBUMPS will demonstrate the integration of SPS with other optical systems, coupling them with the strong evanescent field confined at the surface of a ONF.
2. SPS-ONF coupling alone fails at obtaining collection efficiencies higher than the 10% of the photons emitted by the SPS. To increase the system efficiency SPEEDBUMPS will realize an optical cavity deterministically fabricated on the ONF with unconventional nanofabrication approaches.
3. To further increase the efficiency, in SPEEDBUMPS the isotropic radiation field will be modified through complex nanostructuring of the ONF to realize field-redirecting elements.
Due to the ONF’s nature (suspended, dielectric, curved, nanometric) these results will be unprecedented, paving the way to novel applications in the field of quantum optics.",212066,2024,2026,European Commission,France; Italy,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Disorder in ultrafast phase transitions,"""DISRUPT, which stands for """"DISorder in Ultrafast Phase Transitions,"""" represents a theoretical physics initiative with the primary aim of harnessing both static and time-dependent disorder to gain full control over ultrafast phase transitions occurring in quantum materials.
A key aspiration within the realm of nonequilibrium physics is to attain the ability to manipulate the properties of quantum materials over time, offering numerous potential applications in high-impact technologies such as ultrafast electronics, probabilistic computing, and quantum computing. However, in experiments where a pump-probe approach is employed, disorder is often viewed as an unwelcome factor that threatens to undermine the vision of achieving complete control over the dynamics of quantum many-body systems through the use of light. Our objective is to challenge this conventional perspective and demonstrate that disorder serves two fundamental purposes: Firstly, it enables us to place the system in nonthermal states that would be otherwise inaccessible under equilibrium conditions (as seen in ultrafast inhomogeneous disordering). Secondly, it allows us to theoretically devise robust mechanisms for preventing the thermalization of quantum systems, with direct implications for quantum memory technology. This dual objective lies at the core of our proposal.
To accomplish these objectives, we plan to implement, for the first time according to our knowledge, an out-of-equilibrium extension of real-space Dynamical Mean Field Theory. This will enable us to investigate both the (absence of) thermalization in correlated electron systems experiencing static quenched disorder (Many-Body Localization) and the ultrafast inhomogeneous disordered transition in vanadium dioxide involving annealed time-dependent disorder.""",212066,2025,2027,European Commission,France,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
"Categorical, Homological, and Non-commutative methods in Geometry","This proposal is primarily interested in algebraic geometry, a field that underpins geometric intuition with the precision brought about by calculation from algebra. The algebraic information of an algebraic variety - the set of common zeros of polynomial equations – is packaged in sheaves and organized in categories, which makes it possible to study these objects by importing the tools of homological and (non-)commutative algebra. This categorical approach is natural for many of the current leading questions in mirror symmetry, birational geometry, representation theory, and theoretical physics because it serves as a bridge between the geometric and algebraic language.  It is also fundamental, as many properties and even classification results are not possible without it. 
 
The proposal is deeply interdisciplinary, and it connects broad areas of algebra and geometry. It naturally splits into three parts. 

The first aims to investigate one of the most fundamental properties of curves, namely contractibility, with non-commutative deformation theory. It will generalize classical results using modern language, at the same time producing many new explicit examples of rational curves in threefolds. 
Linking contractibility and non-commutative algebra will bring deep consequences for the birational and enumerative geometry of Calabi-Yau varieties, advancing areas of string theory.

The second part studies surfaces with mild positive curvature (Fano, but with ineffective anticanonical bundle). The main objective is to prove a mirror theorem, packaging physical information with tools of homological algebra. The new heuristics, definitions, and techniques will open up an avenue to investigate higher dimensional settings.

The third part involves reconstructing varieties from associated categorical data. I will tackle some hard open cases, developing new tools and combining them with classical methods.",212066,2025,2027,European Commission,France,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
High-order harmonic generation triggered by elliptically polarized laser pulses,"High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear phenomenon arising from the propagation of a laser pulse throughout a medium. HHG is used to generate tabletop sources of attosecond light pulses, essential for probing ultrafast phenomena in matter at the natural scales of the electrons. The shape of the generated light pulses can be changed by changing the intensity or the frequency of the incident light. However, these parameters cannot be continuously changed in experiments, in contrast to the ellipticity which is moreover simple to adjust and acts as a control knob. While polarization of the incident light is very promising for controlling the shape of the generated attosecond light pulses, up to date, HHG is limited to a narrow range of ellipticities only. 
The project EPHHG aims to control continuously the shape of generated attosecond light pulses from incident elliptically polarized lights in the full range of laser ellipticities. I propose a theoretical and numerical investigation adapted for this purpose. It includes the development of both theoretical models and sophisticated numerical methods in order to simulate and understand the self-consistent light-matter interactions occurring during light propagation.",212065,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Quantum Physics
Hyperforce correlations in ionic soft matter,"Developing a comprehensive microscopic understanding of electrolytes is relevant for a wide range of physical, chemical and biological problems, including battery technology, adsorption of pollutants in soils and the topical area of iontronics, where ions are used for signalling. Characteristic electrolytic behaviour arises from the response of both ions and solvent molecules to the presence of external electrical fields. Fundamental physical description can be based on analysing the equilibrium and dynamical fluctuations that occur in a given system. Relevant fluctuating observables include the particle concentration, the charge, and the electrical current, all of which directly relate to experimentally accessible observables. The concept of forces, despite being fundamental for physical model building, has received far less attention in statistical mechanics. Here we intend to introduce a systematic correlation framework based on the forces and hyperforces, which correlate forces with further physical observables, in ionic systems. Hyperion combines analytical theory with simulation work and it comprises three main tasks: (i) We will first develop and validate the static and dynamic force and hyperforce correlations in bulk, thereby investigating how these relate to number and charge fluctuations. (ii) We will study the influence of external confinement on the electrical fluctuations measured in finite observation volumes as is relevant for transport through channels and nanopores. (iii) We will consider the nonequilibrium correlations that occur during transport induced either by shear flow or by an external electric field with the aim to rationalize the emerging electrophoretic phenomena and the nonequilibrium ion kinetics. As understanding the electrolyte sheds light on the kinetics of individual ions, Hyperion aims to provide a new point of view for ionic structure and the associated nonequilibrium transport in complex environments.",212065,2024,2026,European Commission,France,EU,Engineering; Classical Physics
Levitated Quantum Engine,"To meet the global demand for sustainable energy, new forms of clean energy sources based on heat to work conversion need to
be developed. To that end, the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics aims at devising nanoscale heat engines to exploit
quantum resources and represents a promising vector to industrialize quantum technologies. However, it is still a great challenge to
design and control nanoscale heat engines in the quantum regime.
     The proposed project employs the optomechanical platform of levitated nanoparticles to harvest thermal fluctuations in the
regime where quantum effects are relevant. In particular, it will elucidate the role of inertia in thermodynamic heat engine cycles,
exploit bath engineering techniques and explore the emergence of a quantum speed limit. The project combines the exquisite
optomechanical control of levitated nanoparticles for fast potential change and cooling methods with optimal control theory
including shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques.
     The project benefits from the experienced researcher (ER) extensive skills in stochastic thermodynamics, optomechanics and
quantum optics, the supervisor track record in nano-optics, optical tweezers and stochastic thermodynamics, and the theoretical
support with experts in optimal control theory, both in the classical and quantum regimes. The project will therefore offer a critically

gaLAxies duriNg The Epoch of ReionizatioN,"Our understanding of the first billion years of the Universe, specifically the initial 500 million years, remains quite limited. Until last year (prior to the James Webb Space Telescope launch), only one galaxy had been detected during this period. Since then, the number of candidates from these epochs has surged. This newfound abundance of candidates offers an unprecedented opportunity to delve into a crucial phase known as the epoch of reionization (EoR) marking the Universe's last major gas-phase transition in cosmic history when all the neutral hydrogen gas between galaxies produced by the Big Bang became fully ionized. 

The actors of this transitional period, the mechanisms underlying its emergence, and the physical properties of galaxies during this period are still mainly unknown. Thus, my research aims to probe the fundamental physics governing these galaxies (particularly their density, luminosity, and stellar mass) and investigate if these properties align with our theoretical framework and hydrodynamic simulations. Preliminary studies, including mine, indicate an excess of bright galaxies compared to the models. I aim to unambiguously quantify the excess of bright galaxies during the EoR, characterize their properties, and investigate the underlying physical phenomena that have driven these galaxies to acquire such properties. In particular, I aim to unveil the emergence of dust during the EoR. The core of this research revolves around leveraging the complementarity between the JWST through the COSMOS-Web program – the largest JWST program designed for detecting these galaxies and for which I am one of the architects - and the Euclid telescope.

The outstanding research environment at AIM (host institute) along with my supervisor's expertise offer optimal conditions to enhance my career prospects.

"SEarChing REcent CrYomagmatism in Ceres and Europa, astrobiological targets","""The motivation of this project is to contribute to the search and characterization for potentially habitable planetary environments. During the two last decades, missions to the outer solar system, such as Galileo to the Jupiter system, Cassini-Huygens to the Saturn system and Dawn to the main protoplanets of the asteroid belt, have discovered several """"ocean worlds"""". Jupiter’s moon Europa, Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres, show signs that indicate the presence of liquid water in their interiors, potentially interacting with organic compounds and hot rocks. These """"ocean worlds"""" are now considered as prime astrobiological targets by the major space agencies ESA and NASA. 
This project proposes a strategy to identify freshly erupted materials at the surface of these icy bodies and provide informations on their composition and on the subsurface source.  Specifically, it is focused on Europa and Ceres, the most accessible targets for in-situ landing missions. For this purpose, we will experimentally study the processes that aqueous solutions of diverse compositions undergo from their emplacement in the interior of the crust at medium-high pressure and relatively low temperature, to their subsequent arrival at the surface at high vacuum and much lower temperature. 
Infrared and Raman spectroscopies and mass spectrometry instruments will be used to characterize the different processes from the source conditions to the surface emplacement and subsequent alteration. These techniques are within the science payload of past, current and future missions. Therefore, the data obtained in the laboratory will be used as public databases to assist in the interpretation of spectra taken on space missions.

Concrete K-theory operations for topological physics,"Detecting and measuring the stability of waves, be they sound waves, wave patterns of electrons or light, is a critical task in modern physics. Specifically, stable waves, bound to a position, are a central topic in the study of quantum materials. Low-power transistors and small lasers are some of the devices that can be designed from quantum materials. The critical mathematical tool for detecting these stable waves is called K-theory, a topic that cuts across many of the main subject areas of mathematics. Using tools from operator algebras, a subfield of mathematical analysis, a form of K-theory has recently been discovered to be useful in the development of mathematical probes of computer models of materials. Loring’s group will be developing the subject of K-theory for operator algebras, with particular emphasis on new mathematical techniques that can be implemented in software used by physicists. This project will also create opportunities for students at the University of New Mexico and Florida A&M University to do research and participate in internships at Sandia National Laboratories. The mathematics to be developed in this project will focus on multivariable spectrum for noncommuting operators and associated invariants in real and complex K-theory. These invariants can be applied to detect local topology in a variety of quantum materials. These invariants depend on a local gap in the Hamiltonian, a concept that can be made precise using the Clifford spectrum of the various position operators and the Hamiltonian. Local gaps can exist in topological metals, and in composite systems where a metal lead abuts a topological insulator. The fundamental challenge is to find invariants for matrix models of locally gapped free-fermion systems. Using unsuspended E-theory as a model for real and complex K-homology, Loring will develop simple formulas for these invariants and determine if these invariants are complete.

"Polylogarithms, cluster algebras, and hyperbolic geometry","This award supports research on the interplay between three different research areas: polylogarithms, cluster algebras, and hyperbolic geometry. Polylogarithms generalize the natural logarithm and have been studied since the 18th century. Cluster algebras, invented in the early 21st century, are purely combinatorial objects which are widely studied and broadly applicable. Hyperbolic geometry is a geometry with constant negative curvature, where Euclid's fifth postulate fails. Recent advances have revealed surprising links between these areas. For example, formulas for scattering amplitudes in high energy physics frequently involve polylogarithms evaluated at cluster algebra coordinates. Also, the volume of a certain hyperbolic polyhedron known as an orthoscheme, where successive faces form right angles, is given by a polylogarithm formula. The proposal will investigate key conjectures, find new examples of hyperbolic manifolds, and compute invariants using cluster coordinates. The PI will involve both graduate and undergraduate students in this project and continue his outreach to local schools. The proposal will explore the relationship between polylogarithms and cluster algebras focusing on several key conjectures in the field. These include the Matveiakin-Rudenko conjecture, that all polylogarithm relations arise from the cluster polylogarithm relations of type A_n; Zagier's polylogarithm conjecture, that the zeta function of a number field at integers is expressed by polylogarithms; and Goncharov's depth conjecture, that a polylogarithm is a classical polylogarithm if an only if its truncated coproduct vanishes. The proposal will explore special cases of these conjectures using Matveiakin and Rudenko's notion of cluster polylogarithms as well as new tools developed by the PI and his collaborators. In addition, the proposal will study Rudenko's polylogarithm formula for a hyperbolic orthoscheme, find new examples of hyperbolic manifolds that don't arise from Coxeter groups (and therefore have dihedral angles that are not a submultiple of pi), and generalize formulas for Cheeger-Chern-Simons invariants from dimension 3 to dimension 5.

Characterizing Gravitational Wave signals in O4 and beyond,"The field of gravitational wave astrophysics is experiencing rapid growth, propelled by advances in detector sensitivity and analysis tools. The ongoing fourth observing (O4) run of NSF's Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo, and KAGRA detectors has brought a significant increase in the detection rate of compact binary coalescences, reaching approximately 0.5/day, compared to 1.5/week in the previous run. This award responds to the data analysis needs of O4 with two projects: ensuring that our measurements are robust against contamination from detector artifacts known as glitches and studying the spins of black holes detected with gravitational waves. The award will support the training of students in STEM areas. The award targets two areas of study under gravitational wave data analysis. The first area concerns the spins of black holes in binaries. Black hole spins carry important information about the astrophysical properties of compact binaries, including the question of whether binaries form through dynamical processes in dense environments or through isolated evolution in the field. The project will constrain the astrophysical distribution of black hole spins in binaries using the few hundreds of events expected from O4. The second area addresses challenges in obtaining robust estimates of the binary parameters in the presence of data quality issues. Previous work led to a method for mitigating detector glitches (non-Gaussian detector noise) that coincide with signals by simultaneously modeling the signal and the glitch and subtracting the latter. The project will apply this method to O4 candidates to obtain robust estimates for the binary properties.

Studies of Binary Systems in Strong Gravity,"The direct detection of gravitational waves emitted from merging black holes and merging neutron stars by the NSF's LIGO detectors over the last few years has opened a new window to the Universe. Observations of mergers of two black holes or two neutron stars provide a vast amount of data that allows the study of both strong gravity and matter at extreme densities. As the two objects get close, fully non-linear numerical simulations of the Einstein equations are required to interpret the observational data. By comparing to observations, predictions from these codes can be used to infer information about the stars, including the equation of state at supra nuclear density. The project funded by this award will carry out such simulations. It focuses on scenarios that have not been widely investigated yet, such as neutron stars containing dark matter, or possible deviations from the Einstein equations. In addition, the projects will further develop the computer codes we use for our simulations. The aim is to use more advanced numerical methods to obtain both higher accuracy and also faster simulations. This research will also lead to the publication of simulation results (e.g. gravitational waveforms) which will be useful for the emerging field of gravitational wave and multimessenger astronomy. Part of the planned research will be carried out in close collaboration with researchers at the universities of Jena and Potsdam in Germany. Visits or virtual meetings by faculty, postdocs, and students are planned. This exchange will have educational benefits for students and postdocs at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). Through regular meetings and seminars, the PI's group helps to train students in a wide range of topics ranging from general relativity and astrophysics to computer science and large-scale computing. The project also includes a week-long hands-on summer workshop for students from a nearby high school. The workshop will teach the participating students about programming, motivated by the subject of numerical relativity. All students involved in this project or the workshop will acquire valuable skills that will help build a globally competitive STEM workforce. It is now possible to observe gravitational waves from black hole and neutron star mergers, as well as electromagnetic counterparts in the case of neutron stars. These observations provide a vast amount of data that allows the study of both strong gravity and matter at extreme densities. Using numerical relativity computer simulations, the project funded by this award will investigate scenarios that have not received much attention until now. It will study how dark matter influences binary neutron star mergers in General Relativity. This will be achieved by investigating different neutron star configurations that span a range of dark matter fractions, dark matter particle masses, binary mass ratios, and spins. By comparing to observations, this will lead to limits on the dark matter fraction in neutron stars. The project will also investigate how neutron star mergers differ in massive scalar-tensor gravity, a viable alternative to General Relativity. This will allow testing for possible deviations from General Relativity. To do so, the equations of massive scalar-tensor theory will be implemented in computer programs to create both initial data and to be able to evolve them. In both the dark matter and scalar-tensor cases gravitational wave catalogs, and characteristics of the merger remnant such as final masses and spins, or disk masses, as well as the amount of ejected mass, will be published. This work will be performed with the mature BAM code. Yet, it is also planned to extend the next-generation Nmesh code that aims at achieving higher accuracy. The ultimate goal is to perform long simulations of binary black hole inspirals, where the ratio of the two black hole masses is very high. This project aims to lay the groundwork for this endeavor by deriving a new first-order evolution system that can evolve black holes as punctures when using finite differences. This evolution system will then be implemented in Nmesh, where the elements containing the punctures will use finite differences, while other elements will use a more accurate discontinuous Galerkin method. Another aim is to improve the accuracy of neutron star simulations, by combining discontinuous Galerkin with finite volume methods. The focus will be on studying finite volume methods that do not need to communicate more data than discontinuous Galerkin methods to improve parallelization performance.

Categorification of quasi-split i-quantum groups and related topics in representation theory,"This is a project in representation theory which, roughly speaking, is the idea of understanding symmetry in the broadest sense by studying the different ways in which symmetries can be realized in terms of matrices. There are many applications, including to number theory, combinatorics, low-dimensional topology, theoretical physics and chemistry. Nearly forty years ago, quantum groups were discovered and shown to possess some remarkably rigid canonical bases. This had a dramatic impact on the study of the classical Lie groups which are the most fundamental symmetries in nature. In fact, quantum groups and their canonical bases are shadows of some even more remarkable higher structures, Kac-Moody 2-categories, which are often referred to as the categorifications of quantum groups. In classical mathematics, Lie groups go hand in hand with the symmetric spaces on which they act. Symmetric spaces admit quantizations, namely the i-quantum groups appearing in the title of the project, which were first introduced in 1998 and rapidly developed into a rich theory. This project will also provide research training activities for graduate students. The main goal of this project is to take the next step by categorifying all quasi-split i-quantum groups, building on the recent discovery by the PI and collaborators of a 2-category which categorifies the simplest rank one i-quantum group. This theory, which although algebraic in nature, has many connections to the geometry of the underlying Lie groups via the theory of singular Soergel bimodules. In addition, the PI will study more classical topics in representation theory by applying the deeper understanding of quantum and i-quantum groups that appear as hidden symmetries in more classical settings.

Multiplicities and Valuations in Commutative Algebra,"This award supports a research project on the interaction of algebra and geometry, and the application of commutative algebra to other areas of mathematics.

To resolve singularities is to smooth out, by algebraic operations, the singularities in a space defined by polynomial or analytic equations. Resolution of singularities is still open in certain cases for spaces of dimension greater than 3. It is of importance in other branches of mathematics, physics and engineering. An important focus of the project will be the training of graduate students and the mentoring of young mathematicians from diverse backgrounds. A major topic to be investigated in this project is properties and applications of filtrations in local rings. Another topic to be investigated is inseparable local uniformization, the local resolution of singularities along a valuation after taking a purely inseparable extension. The PI will also investigate the characterization of good properties of extensions of valuations. The project will explore properties of filtrations of rings, including their analytic spread, Hilbert functions and generalized multiplicities. A particular emphasis will be on divisorial filtrations which although non-Noetherian, share many good properties of the Noetherian I-adic filtrations of an ideal I. Inseparable local uniformization will be investigated. This is a local resolution of singularities, after taking a purely inseparable extension. The PI will also study extensions of valuation rings with the goal of giving valuation theoretic characterizations of when the extensions are almost finite etale, or have related good properties.

RUI: Neutron-Star Matter in the LIGO A+ Era and Beyond,"Gravitational-wave observations of neutron star mergers lead to unprecedented insight into the physics of neutron stars and the properties of dense matter. Measuring stellar properties, such as tidal deformations, across a range of neutron-star masses will map the pressure-density connection within the stars: the neutron star equation of state. The work supported by this award will explore the data science problem of equation-of-state inference using gravitational-wave observations, and its integration with knowledge of other astronomical and terrestrial messengers of dense neutron-rich matter. It will develop the community’s ability to account for uncertainties in the source models, as systematic error from waveform modeling is likely to dominate the inference of matter properties as detector network sensitivity increases. Finally, this work will apply uncertainty quantification methods to develop goals for interferometer commissioning and instrumental design, showing how improvements in various frequency ranges will translate into improved science potential. The results will drive design requirements for next-generation facilities to answer key science questions in nuclear astrophysics. This work will engage undergraduate and master’s degree students at California State University Fullerton in developing and applying modern methods of statistical learning and uncertainty quantification to understand the nuclear astrophysics implications of current and future-generation gravitational-wave observations. As members of the Extreme Matter group in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the PI's team will develop inference tools that apply a modern statistical learning framework for equation-of-state inference. The team will connect neutron star-related science goals to frequency-dependent requirements on (1) the accuracy of source models, (2) the detector-network sensitivity and commissioning goals, and (3) the modeling and calibration of the instrumental response. These projects will offer gravitational-wave astronomy as a playground for computational and statistical exploration. Integrating data science and gravitational-wave astronomy will enrich mathematics and physics education at CSUF, recruiting future leaders in gravitational-wave astronomy and launching students toward fulfilling careers in science and technology.

Nonperturbative Green’s function method to study electron-phonon interactions in the strong coupling regime,"A fundamental area of solid state physics is the study of electrons, nuclei vibrations (phonons), and their interactions in crystals, known as electron-phonon interactions (EPIs). EPIs determine the temperature dependence of the bandgap, and lead to conventional superconductivity, among many other important phenomena. EPIs are usually studied using lowest order perturbation theory, which is only valid when the coupling is weak. However, strong EPIs have been reported in many key materials. For example, there is a huge gap renormalization of about 3 eV in high-pressure hydrogen that makes it metallic, and understanding metallic hydrogen is considered a substantial step towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity in hydrides. Research on the gap renormalization and temperature dependence of the gap of diamond is also very active, with exciting possibilities in the development of LEDs for use in extreme environments like high temperatures. However, existing calculations are not well justified, or perturbative approaches do not match experimental data. In GreenNP, we will study these and other effects due to EPIs using a rigorous nonperturbative adiabatic Green's function approach that the experienced researcher (ER) Dr. Jean Paul Nery has recently developed. Strong assets of the project will be the use of first-principles as opposed to models, and the inclusion of anharmonicities. First-principle calculations will be implemented into one of the prime open-source packages of the community, in collaboration with its renowned leading group at a nearby university; and a secondment will be carried out with a specialist in anharmonicities. By the end of the project, through the study of elemental semiconductors and insulators, there will be a clear understanding of the effects of strong EPIs in electronic properties. The ER will be taken to a leadership position in the field of EPIs and higher-order effects, with excellent future career prospects.",207572,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium; Switzerland,EU,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Terahertz high resolution spectroscopy using driven optical resonators,"Spectroscopy is an important tool to understand molecular and atomic phenomena. Dual comb spectroscopy DCS and asynchronous optical sampling AOSPS are prominent techniques in infrared and Terahertz range respectively. Both rely on dual frequency combs or dual (FC), and their limitations stem from the comb design, necessitating a trade-off between speed and resolution. The spectral resolution is limited by the repetition rate of the FC. The most common sources for FC are mode-locked lasers and electro-optic modulators. However, due to technical peculiarities, these techniques are not suited for low repetition rates, leading most spectroscopy systems in the 100 MHz-10GHz range. TRESOR (Terahertz high resolution spectroscopy using driven optical resonators) aims to showcase a novel optical platform based on ultrashort pulses in low repetition rate, high-Q resonator, to address the limitations inherent in FC based spectroscopy methods. On the fundamental front, I will investigate the generation of novel soliton formations, such as super cavity solitons SCS in high intrinsic loss resonator with large detuning. So far, SCS in low repetition rate resonators have not been experimentally explored, mainly because of the lack of a sufficiently precise perturbation. To use the FC based on SCS in the THz range, pulses need to be amplified. This will give rise to a new challenge related to sub-200fs pulse amplification. On the applied side, by using FC based on SCS, TRESOR can improve the resolution and speed of current spectroscopy methods and give rise to new nonlinear measurement techniques. Despite these fundamental and applied reasons, the experimental approach of TRESOR will overcome such challenges and enable the realization of high-resolution spectroscopy in the THz range with performance beyond the state of art. This project is a step forward in my career because it will act as a springboard towards a permanent research position and will allow me to lead a research group",207572,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium,EU,Quantum Physics
Spin Resonance and Time-Resolved Spectroscopy of Optically-Adressable Diradical Qubits,"The rapidly burgeoning field of Quantum Information Science has boosted the efforts to develop materials capable of exploiting the counterintuitive quantum behaviour of matter. Now at the Second Quantum Revolution, the main stumbling block on the route to quantum computers is the lack of quantum materials with ideal properties. Among the wide variety of systems capable to implement qubits in their electron or nuclear spin, carbon-based molecular qubits (MQBs) bring about advantages such as long coherence times, high reproducibility and scalability. However, crucial deficiencies still need to be solved: the lack of single-qubit readout capabilities and the lack of structure-qubit performance relations to exploit the conscious synthesis of MQBs. In this regard, the recent availability of a broad range of stable designs of organic molecules bearing two unpaired electron spins in their ground electronic state, i.e., diradicals, lead an uncharted market for quantum materials. The main selling point of using diradicals as MQBs resides in the possibility of controlling the interaction between the unpaired spins via chemical synthesis. 
In SPECTROBITS, I will investigate new organic diradicals as MQBs to fill the gap in quantum materials. For this, I will establish a direct relation between the spin-spin interaction in diradicals and their performance as MQBs by developing their initialization, readout and manipulation processes. To this end, I will combine my expertise in (time resolved) spectroscopy of diradicals with the expertise of the host in Electron Spin Resonance and Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance, and with advanced quantum chemistry calculations. SPECTROBITS goes beyond the state of the art by investigating the optical addressability of diradical MQBs spanning the whole range of possible spin-spin interactions and by developing single-molecule readout procedures. The final goal is to use these findings to synthetise tailored diradical MQB architectures.",207571,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium; Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Geodesic currents and geometric structures,"This project will study the intrinsic geometry of the space of geodesic currents of a hyperbolic surface, a suitable closure of the space of weighted closed curves containing many geometric structures.  This space has been crucial in many technical developments in the field of hyperbolic geometry, Bers-Teichmueller theory and the geometry of 3-manifolds. Recently, it has permeated into other fields of mathematics, such as compactifications of character varieties or geometric group theory.
The goal of the project is to further these applications and unveil new connections with physics, in the setting of conformal field theories.",207571,2025,2027,European Commission,Luxembourg; France; United Kingdom,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Using the DKIST Cryogenic Near Infra-Red Spectro-Polarimeter (Cryo-NIRSP) to Characterize the Impulsive and Wave Heating of the Solar Corona,"The solar corona, the Sun’s outermost atmospheric layer, is a region of higher temperature and lower density than the photosphere, presenting ongoing challenges in understanding its heating mechanisms. The continuous heating of the corona is believed to be driven by magnetic field disturbances at the base of magnetic flux tubes. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) has capabilities expected to detect signatures of these heating mechanisms. This proposal focuses on characterizing high-frequency transverse waves observable with DKIST. Results from this project will advance knowledge across various fields, such as astrophysics and laboratory plasma physics, contributing to a broader understanding of stellar phenomena and plasma dynamics. The project will the develop a new show at Fiske Planetarium that will translate complex solar physics concepts into an accessible format for a diverse audience, extending its impact globally through online availability and fostering public scientific literacy. The principal investigator will mentor a REU student each year, adopting a personalized, responsive mentoring approach to instill a sense of ownership and independence in their projects. Leveraging DKIST’s advanced instruments, this project has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the fundamental heating mechanisms of the solar corona and enhance the ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of space weather events. This project will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the transverse wave fluctuations within coronal lines, utilizing the unmatched spatial, temporal, spectral, and polarimetric resolutions offered by the DKIST. The team will use computational models to interpret the observed spectral lines, accounting for line-of-sight effects, non-equilibrium ionization, and comparing the derived geometry with a 3D coronal model. The results will provide a clearer understanding of Alfvén wave amplitudes and their role in the solar atmosphere, thereby enhancing the ability to accurately model the energy transfer processes in the solar corona and chromosphere.

"Investigation of Spin, Charge and Lattice Coupling Effects in Van der Waals Crystals in an electron microscope","Lattice structures are ubiquitous in nature, which determine diverse physical and chemical properties of materials. Exploring and controlling crystal structures is a central task of material engineering. Lattice phase transition is considered as a significant approach to manipulate and control functionalities, and thus, understanding the underlying mechanism of phase transition is a basic premise and guarantee for technological applications. A fundamental understanding of the cooperative interplay between charge, spin, orbital and lattice is required to manipulate this process. The emergence of magnetic Van der Waals (vdW) crystals opened up new horizons for engineering phase transition with magnetic orders together beyond the reach of existing materials. Traditional investigation of magnetic phase transition requires neutron diffraction, which requires nuclear reactor to generate neutrons. In this project, I propose to use three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) to study the 3D magnetic orderings, which will serve as a complimentary method to neutron diffraction. I will also study the dynamical behaviour of magnetic ordering in vdW crystals under different electric bias conditions. In addition, I will study the 3D magnetic field distribution at the interface of heterostructures constructed by vdW crystals. I will develop continuous fast holographic tomography (CFHT) with much lower dose and higher speed compared to traditional step-wise tomography. I will also apply a special 3D reconstruction algorithm to reveal and visualize the 3D magnetic field at the heterostructure interface. The outputs of this project will provide insight into the synergy effects of charge, spin and lattice in magnetic materials and greatly facilitate the discovery of novel magnetic materials.",205324,2025,2027,European Commission,Germany,EU,Chemical Sciences; Inorganic Chemistry; Condensed Matter Physics
Extending light wave scanning tunnelling microscopy to ultrafast transport phenomena,"Unravelling the fundamental phenomena of electron motion on its intrinsic time and length scales is a vital pre-requisite for technological applications as dynamics of quantum systems are largely determined by ultrafast processes occurring on sub-picosecond time and atomic length scales. ELISTRA will gain unprecedented access to the ultrafast physics of ballistic electron transport through free-standing graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with atomic scale control by combining for the first time scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) transport experiments with sub-cycle THz laser pulses funnelled into the STM junction (light wave STM). 

To achieve this, single atomically precise GNRs are positioned with sub-nanometre control in a transport configuration bridging tip and substrate of an STM. THz radiation funnelled into the tunnelling junction acts as an ultrafast bias modulation driving electronic currents by opening selective transport channels on the intrinsic time scales of electron motion and tunnelling processes. Using pump-probe schemes, the project will explore the sub-picosecond time evolution of coupling of electrons traversing the ribbon with fundamental excitations like phonon modes. These experiments reveal questions about the possibility to control and modify electronic degrees of freedom beyond electron motion by THz radiation.

ELISTRA will synergistically combine light wave STM, pioneered by the host institution, and STM transport experiments, in which the applicant presents outstanding skills. The project enables the applicant gathering proficiency in the rapidly emerging field combining ultrafast with atomic-scale physics. Building upon his existing expertise, the training will sharpen the applicant’s scientific profile and improve his employment perspectives by emerging him in a host institution, that continuously drives the interdisciplinary frontier of nanoscopic measurements.",205324,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany,EU,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Precision Synthesis of Magnetic Graphenoids as Room Temperature Two-Qubit Systems,"Quantum computing technologies face a fundamental challenge of scalability, primarily due to the lack of materials capable of performing error-free quantum operations at room temperature. Molecular graphenoids (MGs) have displayed superior quantum properties at room temperature, making them an attractive alternative.

This project will bring novel magnetic graphenoids with atomic precision through scalable solution (wet) chemistry and study them as two-qubit systems at room temperature. This proposal will also uncover the suitability of the spin arrangement (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) in MGs as qubit systems with implications for future developments in the field of molecular quantum materials. In the second part, the project focuses on increasing the spin coherence time, one of the key parameters for quantum operations at room temperature. This will be achieved through structural tuning of MGs to minimize the spin decoherence channels. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to introduce new graphenoids as two-qubit systems, answer a fundamental question, and use the new knowledge generated to tune the respective MGs to achieve a spin coherence time (~100 μs) at room temperature, bringing a major advancement in the field.

The proposed study will be of critical fundamental and practical significance by providing novel graphenoids with potential applications in future quantum technologies. The nature of the proposed project is highly interdisciplinary, involving chemistry, physics, molecular magnetism, and material science. The project is in line with the European objectives of sustainable industrial growth and climate change mitigation.

My supervisors, Prof. Feng and Prof. Bogani, have the experience and resources to effectively supervise me and ensure the success of the MSCA action.

Enhancing transport in open magnon systems,"There is a great need for new energy-efficient technologies to meet the ever-increasing energy demands of the 21st century. The field of magnonics aims to address this need by developing nanoscale magnonic devices that use magnons - the excitations of magnetic materials - as information carriers. Because magnons do not require electric currents, they are much more energy efficient than electron-based technologies. 

However, the transport of magnon signals over long distances remains a key challenge, limiting the development of a mature magnonics platform. The central objective of the OpenMag project is to meet this challenge by harnessing the coupling of magnons to their environment. This renders the magnon transport non-Hermitian, opening up pathways to engineer the enhancement of magnon transport. OpenMag will thus open up the field of non-Hermitian spintronics: the study of the spin degree of freedom in non-Hermitian systems. This will be accomplished through two strategies: (1) the interaction of magnons with photons in a cavity and (2) the development of non-Hermitian magnon topological phases through magnon-electron interactions. These strategies will initially be developed in ferromagnets, which allows OpenMag to make use of their well-understood magnetization dynamics. Using insights from ferromagnetic materials, OpenMag will develop non-Hermitian spintronics in antiferromagnets and altermagnets, which will enable access to fast dynamics and downsizing to the nanoscale: two crucial milestones in magnonics.

The OpenMag project will be carried out at the Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) Mainz, under supervision of Prof. Sinova, who leads a world-renowned theory group in spintronics and nanoelectronics. Over the past decades his group has developed the theoretical foundations of antiferromagnets and altermagnets, and is thus the perfect host for building the field of non-Hermitian spintronics in antiferromagnets and altermagnets.",205324,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany,EU,Quantum Physics
Utilization of H2O2 in Transpiration Cooling System for Active Heat Protection and Implementation of Thermal Decomposition for Catalyst Free H2O2/Kerosene Bipropellant Aerospike Rocket Engine,"The rapid increase in the number of small satellites in recent years has dramatically boosted the probability of orbital collisions that inevitably create space debris. To preserve the orbit's sustainability, a storable/stable, environmentally-friendly, highly efficient, and compact propulsion system is required to be mounted on the satellites. Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) and aerospike engines are promising candidates if the major flaws are solved: catalyst performance degradation due to stabilizer poisoning and extreme thermal loads at the spike structure. In this proposal, I want to test the novel concept of utilizing the thermal decomposition process of H2O2 by turning the aerospike engine's cooling challenges into an advantage. Liquid H2O2 adsorbs heat from the structure convectively, then vaporizes/decomposes to create gas layers to protect the structure from the direct contact of the combustion gas. The thermal decomposition of H2O2 eliminates the use of catalysts. Overall, the concept offers a unique approach to an efficient, compact, and durable propulsion system for small satellites.
In the project, liquid H2O2 will be injected into the H2O2/Kerosene staged-combustion vitiated-air heater through the additive manufactured porous metallic wall (Fraunhofer IWS). Testing in various conditions, heat flux/temperature/pressure will be measured directly. Key variables (Da and H*) can't be directly measured. Hence, the mathematical model will be formulated to derive these variables under given conditions. The model will be validated by comparing the mono/bipropellant flame front locations between the simulations/experiments. Then, I will generate a low-order modeling tool that can predict the cooling performance and combustion efficiency based on the data and the model. The tool will be implemented to apply the new concept to existing TUD etholox rockets. The spike module will be fabricated, integrated and tested for concept verification.",205324,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany,EU,Engineering; Space Sciences
Building Blocks for W-algebras,"Vertex operator algebras (VOAs) arose in physics in the 1980s as the symmetry algebras of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) and were first defined mathematically by Borcherds. They have turned out to be fundamental objects with connections to many subjects including finite groups, Lie theory, combinatorics, integer partitions, modular forms, and algebraic geometry. W-algebras are an important class of VOAs that are associated to a Lie (super)algebra g and a nilpotent element f in the even part of g. They appear in various settings including integrable systems, CFT to higher spin gravity duality, the Allday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa correspondence, and the quantum geometric Langlands program. In this project, the PI will investigate the structure and representation theory of W-algebras. This will advance the subject and provide research training and collaborative opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In more detail, principal W-algebras (the case where f is a principal nilpotent) are the best understood class of W-algebras. They satisfy Feigin-Frenkel duality, and in classical Lie types they also admit a coset realization which has numerous applications to representation theory. It turns out that both Feigin-Frenkel duality and the coset realization are special cases of a more general duality which was conjectured by Gaiotto and Rapcak and proven recently by the PI and Creutzig. It says that the affine cosets of certain triples of W-algebras are isomorphic as 1-parameter VOAs. These cosets are known as Y-algebras in type A, and orthosymplectic Y-algebras in types B, C, and D. The Y-algebras can all be obtained as 1-parameter quotients of a universal 2-parameter VOA, and they are conjectured to be the building blocks for all W-algebras in type A. The orthosymplectic Y-algebras are quotients of another universal 2-parameter VOA, but they are not all the necessary building blocks for W-algebras in types B, C, and D. The main goals of this project are (1) to identify the missing building blocks, which we expect to arise as quotients of a third universal 2-parameter VOA; (2) to prove that W-algebras of all classical types can be obtained as conformal extensions of tensor products of building blocks. Special cases will involve W-algebras with N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry, and the PI hopes to prove some old conjectures from physics on coset realizations of these structures. Finally, the Y-algebras and other building blocks admit many levels where their simple quotients are lisse and rational. Exhibiting W-algebras at special levels as extensions of building blocks will lead to many new rationality results.

Critical lessons: from condensed matter to quantum gravity,"Conformal field theories are immensely constrained due to conformal invariance---the task essentially reduces to the computation of a set of numbers called the 'CFT data'---yet difficult to solve; they have direct experimental relevance for critical phenomena, and they have ramifications in almost all areas of modern theoretical physics, from statistical physics to quantum gravity. The task of understanding this class of theories is of such importance that the development of new specific techniques has been one of the main endeavors of the community in the past few decades. Most modern approaches exploit CFT axioms to encode theory-independent constraints on the CFT data. They broadly fall under the name 'bootstrap', one of the most successful instances of which is the lightcone bootstrap, which allows to infer universal properties of the large-spin sector of any CFT and gives rise, in the holographic context, to a simple effective gravitational description. It is not surprising that other approaches based on effective field theory (EFT) were subsequently developed to study emergent universal features of CFT data, such as the large-charge expansion in particular. As an EFT-based approach, much of the excitement stems from its ability to deduce structural properties of CFTs with global symmetries without referring to a specific model, thereby classifying them into 'large-charge universality classes', the most prominent one being associated with a conformal superfluid EFT. It however came as a surprise that nonrelativistic CFTs, or NRCFTs, were the perfect ground on which to run the large-charge program, due to the fact that (1) the state-operator correspondence establishes an astonishing connection with ultracold atom experiments (2) the algebra always contains a global symmetry associated with particle number, (3) the number of particles in the aforementioned experiments is always large. Therefore, the formal study of NRCFT data in the large-charge sector is guided by its profound relationship with experiment.Building upon this, I plan to pursue three lines of research, all of which follow the same approach: studying formal properties of (NR)CFTs inspired by condensed matter to develop a better understanding of certain aspects of black hole physics and holography. I ask (1) whether one can develop analytic methods to study the large-spin sector of NRCFTs and what can be learnt from it in the holographic context, (2) whether one can push the large-charge analytic bootstrap in order to learn about new large-charge phases, with particular emphasize on black hole phases and (3) whether one can develop formal properties of nonrelativistic and Carrollian CFTs side by side, which are nonstandard classes of CFTs that share lots of similarities, the former being relevant to condensed matter while the latter is a strong candidate for flat-space holography.",204838,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Entanglement-Assisted Thermoelectric Transport in Quantum Systems,"""In the proposed project """"Entanglement-Assisted Thermoelectric Transport in Quantum Systems"""" (EATTS), the European Researcher Dr. Nahual Sobrino, together with Prof. Rosario Fazio at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), will collaborate with international research groups to unveil innovative thermoelectric properties that hold transformative potential for sustainable energy technologies, quantum information science, and the development of advanced quantum materials. The project's objectives will concentrate on the exploration of thermoelectric phenomena mediated by entangled electrons across a variety of quantum systems. A comprehensive theoretical and computational framework will be established to explore and enhance thermoelectric performance in systems where electron entanglement plays a pivotal role. Cutting-edge calculations will be performed using sophisticated theoretical frameworks, including Quantum Master Equations (QME), Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM), and quantum information techniques. This will guide to elucidate the intricate relationship between entanglement, system-environment interactions, and thermoelectric performance in Double Quantum Dots (DQD) and Cooper Pair Splitters (CPS) systems. Moreover, the project aims to extend the scope of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to access to entanglement measures in transport scenarios through the development of extensions of iq-DFT. This will facilitate a more efficient computational description of thermoelectric phenomena under the influence of entangled electrons. Additionally, the thermoelectric and entanglement characteristics of multiple diatomic molecules will be investigated by mapping the system into effective Hamiltonian models. The computational framework developed will advance our understanding and serve as a guide for experimental endeavors by selecting promising materials and parameter regimes.""",204138,2025,2027,European Commission,France,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Quantitative HYpoxia imaging for charged ParticlE Radiation treatment guidance: an improved strategy for Aggressive brain Cancers Treatment,"Glioblastoma and skull base chordoma are two of the most aggressive types of brain cancers and have an extremely poor prognosis, with most tumours recurring within months of surgical and chemoradiation treatments. Recurrence is caused by tumour heterogeneity, as regions of the tumour with different biological properties respond differently to treatment. Tumour hypoxia (low oxygenation) is the leading cause of resistance to radiotherapy in heterogeneous cancers and is linked to poor patient prognosis. Effectively counteracting tumour hypoxia requires delivering higher doses of radiation selectively to hypoxic tumour regions. This is hard to achieve with conventional radiation treatment, where a uniform moderate radiation dose is delivered to the entire tumour target and dose-escalation strategies are limited by toxicity constraints established to limit damage to important surrounding brain structures. Standard radiotherapy plans do not incorporate any measure of tumour hypoxia, due to limitations in imaging techniques currently used for planning. The work proposed in this fellowship aims to improve radiation treatment for heterogeneous cancers by combining quantitative MRI/PET imaging, to non-invasively characterise regions of tumour hypoxia, and carbon ions radiotherapy, to deliver higher doses of radiation to those regions, whilst sparing surrounding healthy tissue. This strategy will deliver a more effective radiation dose distribution, providing an opportunity to improve local tumour control and patients’ survival outcomes and quality of life.",204138,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy; Italy,EU,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
STAT-TMDs: A statistical approach to TMD studies,"The description of the proton properties and its internal structure is still a challenging issue within Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interaction. The standard one-dimensional picture, encoded in collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), is not able to explain the proton spin budget in terms of quark and gluon spin. A new class of parton distributions, including intrinsic transverse momentum effects, has then been introduced: the Transverse Momentum Dependent PDFs (TMDs). By encoding the correlation between the proton/parton spin and the parton intrinsic transverse momentum, they can provide a much richer and detailed picture: a 3D image of the proton. TMDs are now of great interest in hadron and spin physics, being able to describe several experimental observables at moderate and high energy. At the same time, they represent a perfect ground for testing fundamental properties of QCD, such as universality and factorisation.

STAT-TMDs aims at building an improved statistical framework for studies of TMDs, applying for the first time modern statistical techniques to TMD analyses. Through a bottom-up approach, I will provide new and more robust phenomenological extractions of (un)polarised quark and gluon TMDs, carefully assessing the uncertainties in the data and extrapolation regions. This will eventually allow, thanks to global Bayesian reweighting techniques, for a quantitative estimate of factorisation breaking effects in inclusive polarised hadronic reactions.

The project represents a timely effort, as it has the ambition to determine a new standard for the hadron physics community, and to set the ground for the future precision era of TMD studies, when data from the future US Electron-Ion Collider and fixed-target programs at the LHC will come.",204138,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Quantum Physics
Black hole spin and mass function in gaseous proto-clusters,"Gravitational-wave (GW) Astronomy opened a new window to the Universe from its infant state to the present. The key physical systems which allow probing the Universe through these vast time and length scales are Black Holes (BH). Low metallicity clouds, composed primarily of atomic hydrogen, before and during the epoch of reionization, are a natural environment for BHs to be born and form Binary Black Holes (BBH) which can merge via GW emission. Stellar BHs, being the remnants of the death of very massive stars, are generated early when a huge gas reservoir is available for accretion. Mass segregation leads the BHs close to the center of the system and a dense BH-subcluster, supported by gravitational fluctuations, is formed. The low metallicity of the gas suppresses cooling, while turbulence of the gas and the BHs’ motion further favor quasi-spherical accretion, surpassing the Eddington limit. For sufficiently compact configurations, the BHs shall grow in mass before the gas is depleted by stellar evolution and formation feedback processes. This rapid mass growth through turbulent hot accretion shall leave a distinct spin signature on the BHs. The BBH that accrete gas quasi-spherically may harden if there is not significant angular momentum loss from the system. Furthermore, these are also ideal conditions for high-redshift Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBH) to form. We shall calculate the spin distribution of stellar BHs accreting gas in proto-clusters, calculate the BH mass function following such accretion events, investigate the evolution of separation in accreting BBH in low-metallicity hot turbulent gas, develop theoretical models for the evolution of a BH-subcluster inside proto-clusters and investigate the formation of IMBH. Finally, we shall develop methods for identifying the origin of GW observations, confront our results with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, and investigate synergetically the implications for the GW mission LISA and the X-ray mission Athena.",204138,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences

General characterisation of near term quantum advantage regimes,"Quantum computing is a very rapidly developing field with the potential to address problems that were considered intractable some decades ago. Despite the daunting technological challenge, quantum devices have reached a size for which their calculations cannot be fully simulated by classical computers. Nevertheless, noise and short coherence times hinder their actual performances, and the algorithms with proven quantum advantage will not be implemented soon.  
This intermediate scenario opens exciting avenues and poses several challenges. How to systematically identify tasks where a quantum advantage over classical computers can be obtained in the near term? Once they are found, how to certify that the same computation cannot be reproduced by any classical means?
ENCHANT, gENeral CHAracterisation of Near-Term quantum advantage regimes, proposes a radically new vision: the development of a comprehensive toolset to characterise the remarkable realm of near-term quantum advantage regimes. The toolset is meant to provide three fundamental assets for such an ambitious task: (A) a general framework encompassing the algorithms that can be run in current devices, compatible with their main limitations and constraints. We envision to obtain that by means of a careful  classification of the families of states that can be obtained as the output of near-term quantum computation, (B) an assortment of task-tailored classical algorithms to simulate the performances of quantum devices. Here the interest is two-fold: to provide comparative methods to assess the quality of those devices and to identify tasks with no quantum advantage over classical computers, (C) a selection of techniques to certify quantum effects in computation and relating them to the hardness of simulating the same task classically. To make them amenable for quantum advantage regimes, we look for methods that rely on partial information about a quantum system.",204136,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Non-Hermitian topological systems and their applications for sensors,"Non-Hermitian topological systems have emerged as a promising area of study within condensed matter physics, garnering substantial attention in recent years. Their distinct characteristics, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and their potential applications in sensing technologies, have spurred a surge of interest and investigation. This research proposal outlines a comprehensive program aimed at studying non-Hermitian systems and exploring their practical utility in the development of innovative devices.
The research program is structured around two primary branches, each addressing critical aspects of non-Hermitian systems. The first branch seeks to develop a robust theoretical tool for comprehending and predicting non-Hermitian skin effects in disordered systems, particularly in higher than one dimension. For this wave packet dynamics will be used as a method. As part of the program, a comprehensive code package will be produced, facilitating access to these simulations for fellow scientists and researchers.
The second branch of this program focuses on the theoretical development of mechanical metamaterial devices capable of studying non-Hermitian matrices. In stark contrast to conventional approaches, where the dynamical matrix of the system is designed to be non-Hermitian the aim is to engineer systems where the response matrices to external drive exhibit non-Hermitian characteristics. This idea builds on recent research findings where such systems have been successfully realized by us in conductance matrices. Extending this approach to mechanical metamaterials, offers a versatile and rapidly deployable platform. Collaborative efforts with experimentalists will play a pivotal role in the actualization of these novel devices, poised to advance the frontiers of applied non-Hermitian physics.",203092,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
Precision QCD @ LHC using Energy Correlators,"This project will have a major impact on the LHC extraction of the top quark mass, which is one of the most important measurements to be performed in the coming years. Currently, the top mass measurement suffers from theoretical imprecision, including an over-reliance on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and an inadequate treatment of non-perturbative hadronization physics, with no systematic prospects for improvement. To address these challenges, this project adopts cutting-edge approaches using the powerful theoretical tools of effective field theories of QCD and novel jet substructure techniques. The proposed action will pave the way for a sub-GeV precise measurement in a well-defined field-theoretic mass scheme, eliminating long-standing uncertainties in the current methodology. It will also simultaneously tackle the challenges of systematically accounting for hadronization effects, which have also impacted jet substructure determinations of the strong coupling constant. The project leverages the Experienced Researcher’s (ER)  unique expertise in this area and established collaborations with LHC experimentalists. Its cornerstone is the use of energy-energy correlators (EECs), which enable precision measurements in the complex environment of the LHC by efficiently removing various sources of contamination in the jets while providing a theoretical control superior to conventional jet substructure observables. Capitalizing on the ER’s recent proposal to exploit EECs on boosted top quarks as a top mass-sensitive probe, we will compute state-of-the-art theoretical predictions for this top mass-sensitive observable with next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, well beyond the reach of current MC simulations. With the primary goal of enabling a direct comparison of theoretical prediction, we will develop a systematic, model-independent field-theoretic framework for describing hadronization corrections in complex modern jet substructure observables.",203092,2025,2027,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Interstellar Chemical Evolution: Probing HCN and HNC Formation and Destruction on Icy Surfaces with Computational Chemistry,"HCN and HNC are routinely used by astronomers to trace temperature and dense gas regions in galaxies, where stars and planetary systems form. They are key precursors of complex species, including prebiotic molecules like amino acids and nucleotides. While their gas-phase formation and evolution are well understood, their formation and destruction paths on interstellar ices remains largely unchartered territory.

The aim of this proposal is to remedy this knowledge gap by investigating the formation of HCN and HNC through CN radical hydrogenation on interstellar water and CO ices, as well as their destruction paths using state-of-the-art computational chemistry and astrochemical modelling. Including, in all cases, their deuterated counterparts. It also presents an opportunity to study the interaction of CN radicals with ice surfaces, which can occur either through physisorption or hemibonding on both types of ices. The four primary objectives of this proposal are: (i) to explore the CN to water and CO ice binding energy distribution as well as the dominant binding modes, (ii) to quantify the hydrogenation reactions of CN with atomic and molecular hydrogen forming HCN and HNC, as well as other possible hydrogenation products due to the hemibonding interactions, (iii) to investigate the destruction of the products in the previous point resulting from further hydrogenation reactions, and finally, (iv) to calculate the rate constants, including quantum tunnelling, and implement these in the UCLCHEM astrochemical model to assess the importance of surface chemistry in two specific cases: the shocked region L1157-B1 and the NGC1068 galaxy.

The novelty of this proposal lies in the combination of computational chemistry and astrochemical modelling to unveil the ice-surface formation and evolution of HCN and HNC and their deuterated counterparts for the first time, encompassing a comprehensive characterization of the CN to water and CO hemibonding interaction.",203092,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Chemical Sciences; Space Sciences
Gravitational Waves from Strings with Adaptive Mesh Refinement,"Cosmic strings are motivated by simple extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics (BSM), including dark matter axion models (axion cosmology), superstring theory and grand unified theories. If present, cosmic strings will radiate gravitational waves (GWs) which could be detected by current and future GW experiments, such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Detection or bounds placed on cosmic strings provide deep insight into BSM particle physics models, and are a potential discovery channel for new fundamental fields.

Searches for cosmic strings in LVK data have to date used analytic waveforms predicted using the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. This is problematic, as the NG model is known to be inaccurate in precisely the high-curvature regions from which the strongest GW signals are emitted. These waveforms have never been verified by numerical simulation, so current matched template searches may not provide useful information or constraints. GWStrings will address this by producing the first waveforms for cosmic string cusp configurations in full numerical relativity (NR) and using them to perform a matched template search in the LVK data. GWStrings will also match these waveforms to current analytic models to determine their validity. Simulations will be implemented using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) NR code, GRChombo.

GWStrings will require crucial input from researchers in two key areas: theoretical understanding of fundamental fields in the strong gravity regime, and GW source modelling and data analysis. The first will be provided through a secondment at Sapienza University of Rome in the world-leading gravity theory group of Prof Paulo Pani. The second will be provided by GRAPPA, the host institute, whose foundational focus lies in connecting astroparticle physics, gravitational physics and cosmology, where the project supervisor Prof Samaya Nissanke, an internationally-recognised GW data analysis expert.",203092,2025,2027,European Commission,Netherlands; Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
ORCHID: Organic Reactions through Carbon addition to H2 on Interstellar Dust grains,"The recent progress in astrochemical studies of the molecular makeup of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) has revolutionized our understanding of the early phases of star and planet formation. A significant gap, however, still exists and that involves the role of molecular hydrogen (H2)—the most abundant molecule in the universe—in interstellar ice chemistry. ORCHID aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of H2 on the formation and evolution of complex organic molecules (iCOMs) in the ISM. Given the lack of existing literature detailing solid-state reaction pathways incorporating H2, ORCHID hypothesizes that H2 reactions with carbon atoms is instrumental in unexplored chemical pathways for iCOMs formation. To achieve its objectives, ORCHID uses state-of-the-art experimental setups to produce quantitative data that aligns with the latest observations of interstellar ices from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and gas-phase observations from radio-telescopes like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Specifically, the project: (1) explores iCOMs formation through previously overlooked pathways involving H2, completing and extending reaction networks in the ISM; (2) generates accurate parameters for astrochemical models, facilitating simulations that match observations of star- and planet-forming regions; (3) investigates the conditions under which iCOMs are released into the gas phase, especially at temperatures where thermal desorption is not feasible in the ISM. The insights and data generated by ORCHID will serve as a robust foundation for interpreting ongoing and future astronomical observations. Moreover, the project will enrich existing gas-grain kinetic models, effectively bridging the grain-gas gap and thereby advancing our understanding of how chemical processes in the ISM influence the composition of celestial bodies in star- and planet-forming regions.",203092,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Space Sciences
Unveiling massive stellar clusters as cosmic ray accelerators,"The origin of Galactic cosmic rays is a persistent and fundamental open question in modern astrophysics. Gamma-ray observations have in the past five years suggested young massive stellar clusters as prominent cosmic ray accelerators but remain unable to provide smoking gun evidence for this scenario. Specifically, the exact sites, acceleration physics, and power sources of cosmic ray production in such clusters are unknown and unquantified. Building on revolutionary developments in radio telescope capabilities to overcome these limitations, I will explore novel MeerKAT and Australian Square Kilometre Array Precursor observations to, for the first time: (i) directly locate the shock sites of cosmic ray acceleration in three massive clusters; (ii) measure the microphysical properties of the acceleration process using stellar bow shocks as pristine, isolated testbeds; and (iii) obtain the most complete measurements of the power reservoir in massive star winds in these clusters. This three-step approach will confirm young massive stellar clusters as cosmic ray accelerators, reveal the exact acceleration scenario for the first time, measure currently unconstrained but essential physical properties for cluster modelling (large scale and local magnetic fields, acceleration efficiencies, cumulative stellar wind power), and lay the foundation for synergies between planned future radio and gamma-ray telescopes. I will openly distribute all analysed radio images and analysis tools developed in this Action to facilitate open science and maximize their impact as a training tool for the astrophysical community. I will furthermore develop an interactive high-school engagement module based on the analysed MeerKAT data. Performing this work at the UvA, I will simultaneously acquire the research, management, and supervision training that will complete my transition into a fully rounded research group leader.",203092,2025,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Three-dimensional shock-Wave/boundary layEr intEracTions hypErsonic tuRbulent flowS,"Hypersonic vehicles, with velocities exceeding five times the speed of sound, are pivotal for space exploration, reusable launch technologies, and rapid civil transportation. A major challenge in advancing these technologies is the complex phenomenon of three-dimensional shock wave boundary layer interaction (SBLI). SBLI occurs when rapid shock waves from vehicle control surfaces intersect with the surrounding turbulent air layer. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial due to its impact on control, drag, heat transfer, noise, and structural integrity. This research aims to unravel the physics of SBLI in hypersonic conditions using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). DNS allows us to capture the real-gas effects and complex vehicle geometries, in order to explore three-dimensional effects and complex shock patterns. Successful completion of this research will provide insights into flow distortion, unsteadiness phenomena, and shock-induced gas effects, bridging the knowledge gaps and improving existing computational models for hypersonic applications. This research, therefore, carries significant implications for shaping the future of aerospace technology and exploration, given the strong implications for aerodynamics, especially in the emerging hypersonic vehicles, shedding light on unique hypersonic effects and knowledge transferability from supersonic regimes.",203092,2025,2026,European Commission,Netherlands; Italy,EU,Engineering; Aerospace Engineering; Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; Space Sciences
Protein Phototermal Optomechanical Analyzer,"Label-free detection and discerning of single proteins is essential to reduce the impact of degenerative diseases (e.g. cancer) by its ultra-early detection as well as to expand our understanding on the processes taking place in living beings. The objective of this project is developing a new technique for the optomechanical label-free detection and characterization of single protein. The working principle of the proposed technique consist on illuminating a protein and transferring its photothermal heating to a suspended membrane on which it is adsorbed. This suspended membrane can mechanically oscillate in drum-like modes, so as the protein transfers its heat to the membrane, its mechanical properties will change, producing a shift in its resonance frequency. Therefore, tracking the resonance frequency as a function of the incident light’s wavelength will allow discerning among different proteins by obtaining their absorption spectra.

On the other hand, PROPHOTOM will have a high impact on my career. Implemented at TU Delft and supervised by Prof. Peter G. Steeneken and Dr. Farbod Alijani, this project will allow introducing myself into new subjects which the supervisors master (2D materials and condensed matter physics). Furthermore, the supervisors will benefit from my wide expertise on mechanical resonators for the optical characterization of biological samples, which guarantees the two-way transfer of knowledge. In addition to the scientific training, this project will also provide me different non-scientific skills, increasing my competencies and employability while allowing me developing an international network.

Eventually, this project will contribute significantly to Europe’s economic and societal advance providing knowledge in different subjects (biophysics, biochemistry or medicine) and new technologies, contributing to the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 & 9) and Horizon Europe Missions (HEM cancer).",203092,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Photo Stability of Ice-bound Complex Organic Molecules,"The universality of life – i.e. the likelihood that life can form in extra-terrestrial environments – hinges upon the availability of certain molecular building blocks. Whether the biomolecules of which we are made form before or after planet formation is an open question in astrochemistry; answering this question requires an understanding of the life cycle of biomolecular precursors (BPs) in various circum- and interstellar environments. Numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) with biological significance have been identified in star- and planet-forming regions through astronomical observations, motivating laboratory studies aiming to uncover the mechanisms by which prebiotic molecules are born during the early stages of planetary evolution. However, formation of BPs can only partially answer questions regarding the likelihood of life evolving elsewhere in the universe. It is also critical to understand the stability of such species in the harsh environment of the interstellar medium (ISM).

Whether small BPs would have sufficient lifetimes in the ISM to eventually coalesce into larger COMs is the central question of this research proposal, which concerns the Photo-Stability of Ice-bound Complex Organic Molecules (PSI-COM). Laboratory experiments on interstellar ice analogues containing selected BPs will be performed using a fully operational and highly-specialized ultra-high vacuum apparatus. Ices will be bombarded with ultraviolet radiation characteristic of that produced in dense interstellar clouds as well as in the diffuse ISM, and the chemical evolution will be tracked to yield kinetic and mechanistic information useful to astronomical models of star and planet formation. The results will be compared with or used to steer observational studies, such as the James Webb Space Telescope.",203091,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Astronomical Sciences
A Compact Continuous Superradiant Clock on the mHz strontium line,"Optical atomic clocks can measure time with an uncertainty on the order of just a few seconds over the age of the universe. Measurement with this level of precision has far-reaching applications, from the measurement of minute changes in the fundamental physics constants revealing physics beyond the Standard Model, to technological advances in navigation and network synchronization. To unlock the full potential of atomic clocks, we must minimize the dependence on the precision of an external optical resonator and miniaturize the experimental apparatus required, allowing for field-deployability. In this project, I will realize the first ever continuous superradiant laser based on 88-Sr atoms, theoretically proposed to reach a linewidth even smaller than the ultra-narrow natural linewidth of the clock transition in strontium.  I will then use the continuous superradiant laser as the basis for the first ever continuous superradiant optical clock, minimizing uncertainties due to the Dick effect. Further, during the fellowship I will use my previous experience with compact cold atom systems to miniaturize the experimental apparatus as a step towards a compact continuous superradiant clock.",203091,2025,2027,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Tuning the Tracks: Resolving the interplay between microtubule lattice conformation and kinesin-1 selectivity using cryo-EM,"Kinesin-1 transports cellular cargos along microtubules as part of neuronal transport. The localisation of kinesin-1 in neurons is tightly controlled to ensure the coordinated delivery of specific cargoes to the regions where they are required. One mechanism of control is through microtubule regulation, but the details of this are not well understood. It has recently been shown that microtubule lattice spacing influences kinesin-1 localisation in U2OS cells. However, the role lattice spacing plays in neuronal transport is unclear. This project aims to investigate features of kinesin-1 based neuronal transport on multiple scales. First, this project aims to use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate how kinesin-1 binds to specific microtubule subsets. I will resolve the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a dimeric kinesin-1 construct (stableMARK) bound to microtubules with different lattice states. This will explain its lattice specificity and help uncover the mechanics of kinesin-1 walking. Secondly, I will map microtubule lattice spacing in neurons using in situ cryo-electron tomography to establish the lattice diversity within this complex microtubule network. Thirdly, I will use cryo-correlative light electron microscopy and stableMARK to determine if lattice spacing influences kinesin-1 localisation in neurons. This project will answer key biological questions on cytoskeletal transport, which will be applicable to other microtubule-based motors and microtubule associated proteins. Defects in kinesin-1 based transport have been implicated in multiple neuropathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease, therefore further understanding of how neuronal transport is controlled will help uncover the mechanism of these diseases.",203091,2024,2026,European Commission,Netherlands,EU,Biological Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
"Collaborative Research: Small quantum groups, their categorifications and topological applications","This award funds research in an area of abstract algebra. Throughout history, mathematics and physics have had profound influences on each other. In the late 20th century, physicists discovered a deep connection between quantum physics and three-dimensional shapes, leading to the concept of topological quantum field theory (TQFT). While these 3D theories cannot fully describe our 4D universe, condensed matter physicists have found surprising applications of them in the field of quantum computing. In an effort to bridge the gap between these three-dimensional theories and our actual universe, Crane and Frenkel introduced a program called ""categorification"" in the late 1990s. This program aims to lift three-dimensional TQFTs to four dimensions, making it a more direct reflection of our physical reality. The PIs will involve students and postdocs in this research, with particular focus on students from underrepresented minorities. The first significant development in categorification was the discovery of Khovanov homology. This is a powerful invariant of links whose graded Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial. The investigators plan to use the technical machinery of hopfological algebra to extend a dual version of Khovanov homology to a homological invariant of three-dimensional manifolds whose graded Euler characteristic is the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. Ideally, this construction will be fully functorial, giving rise to an invariant of four-dimensional manifolds, while remaining computationally accessible. These invariants are expected be sensitive to smooth structures and should give insights into smooth topology not provided by gauge theoretic invariants like Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants. This direction will build upon the investigators' previous work on categorified quantum groups and their representations at roots of unity. It is an open question of how to incorporate hopfological structures into Khovanov homology. This should lead to new homotopic notions. The investigators also plan on continuing to develop non-semisimple versions of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories with an eye toward applications to quantum computation. These non-semisimple invariants have certain topological advantages over their more classical semisimple counterparts. This line of research will also build upon their work on the centers of small quantum groups which has recently been an active area of research in geometric representation theory.

Combinatorics of Complex Curves and Surfaces,"Two-dimensional tilings lie at a fulcrum connecting many areas of mathematics and physics. Easy to visualize and appealing in their simplicity, tilings have fascinated mathematicians at all levels, artists, architects, and the general public. This goals of this project are (1) to study tilings in the context of recent mathematical developments about algebraic curves and surfaces, exploring their connections to algebra, geometry, and representation theory, (2) to disseminate mathematical ideas to a wide audience and increase aesthetic and intellectual appreciation of mathematics in the general public, and (3) to develop an active and diverse community of young researchers, postdocs, and PhD students focusing on this circle of ideas. One primary area of research will be modular toroidal compactifications of spaces of K3 surfaces. This project, joint with V. Alexeev, seeks to build extensions of the universal family of polarized K3 surfaces to the boundary of a toroidal compactification, extending previous work on degree 2 and elliptic K3 surfaces. The approach employs tilings of integral-affine structures on the sphere. The second primary research topic is moduli spaces of higher differentials. This project aims to study strata of higher differentials, their volumes, and the connection with enumeration of tilings. Joint work with P. Smillie explores decompositions of flat surfaces into Penrose-like tiles. The approach is novel, requiring a generalization of Hurwitz theory to one complex-dimensional leaf spaces.

Structure of ancient solutions to Ricci and mean curvature type flows,"Geometric flows are evolution equations that describe motions of surfaces, or their higher dimensional analogues, with speeds determined by their curvatures. Of significant interest in this research are the mean curvature flow and the Ricci flow, which are often likened to the diffusion of heat and the heat equation. These flows leverage the concept of diffusion to canonically deform geometric objects towards equilibrium states, which are significantly easier to characterize or analyze. Geometric flows have thus demonstrated valuable geometric applications, particularly in classification theorems and geometric inequalities. Notable examples include the utilization of Ricci flow to the resolution of the long-standing Poincare conjecture, and the application of inverse mean curvature flow in establishing the Riemannian Penrose inequality, a crucial statement in general relativity. Beyond geometry, geometric flows find extensive use in various physical problems. For instance, mean curvature flow plays a role in describing interface evolution in multiphase physical models. Likewise, it is employed in material science to model the growth of cells, grains, and bubbles. Additionally, a discrete version of Ricci flow is applied in data science, such as in community detection. The study of geometric flows and their diverse applications represents a vibrant and influential area of mathematics. This project aims to enhance the field's impact by involving graduate students in different facets of research and fostering collaborations among researchers across diverse disciplines and institutions. The forthcoming research will concentrate on ancient solutions to the mean curvature and Ricci flows. Ancient solutions refer to solutions that have existed for all times in the past. They are of particular interest due to their significance in studying singularities, which present challenges to the geometric applications of these flows. Understanding the geometry and behavior of ancient solutions is therefore crucial. Despite significant advances in this area in recent decades, there remain large classes of such solutions about which little is known. The proposed project seeks to offer classification results for ancient solutions of mean curvature, mean curvature type, and Ricci flow, without making noncollapsing or compactness assumptions. Our strategy involves developing a method to construct new collapsed ancient solutions and classify them based on specific symmetry assumptions. Drawing on our established methods for constructing and characterizing ancient convex solutions to mean curvature flow, which have proven successful and adaptable, we aim to explore the potential existence of a dichotomy theorem for Ricci flow akin to the one for mean curvature flow, by introducing a width concept for Ricci flow. Finally, by refining and enhancing these techniques, we aim to furnish a more comprehensive classification result for convex collapsed solutions of mean curvature flow.

Factorization and degeneration of chiral homology,"A classical problem, with many applications in the sciences, engineering and the arts, is to determine the symmetries of an object. The branch of mathematics that studies such questions is called representation theory. In this field, symmetries are studied in part by packaging them together as abstract structures with appropriate algebraic properties, such as groups or Lie algebras. Vertex Operator Algebras (VOAs) are a generalization of Lie algebras. VOAs are tightly connected to theoretical physics in what is known as Conformal Field Theory, and, also, to the geometry of surfaces, like spheres or donut-like objects. An important way to study VOAs and their relationship to geometry is via what is known as Chiral Homology. This can be seen as a recipe that takes a VOA and a surface as ingredients and produces a collection of spaces that encode information about the symmetries of the VOA and the complexity of the surface they depend on. However, a variety of fundamental questions about the spaces produced through this recipe are still unresolved. In this project the PI will answer some of these questions. In particular, the PI will describe how Chiral Homology behaves when the surface it depends on is appropriately deformed, and provide a geometric realization of Chiral Homology. The project will also provide research training opportunities for students. In more technical terms, spaces of conformal blocks associated with projective curves--the algebraic analogue of surfaces--and Lie algebras have been a central object of study in algebraic geometry. In fact, these spaces can be identified with generalized theta functions on the moduli space of principal bundles, and they also define vector bundles on moduli spaces of stable curves. One can consider natural generalizations of these spaces: replacing Lie algebras with VOAs; considering the derived notion of conformal blocks, called Chiral Homology; and allowing the projective curve to admit worse than nodal singularities. The PI and her coauthors have shown that conformal blocks from regular VOAs satisfy factorization and sewing. These properties explicitly control the behavior of conformal blocks under nodal degeneration of the curve they depend on and have been the main tools to explicitly compute the dimensions of these spaces through the Verlinde formula. The In this project, the Pi will show that Chiral Homology from regular VOAs satisfies factorization and sewing. Furthermore, the PI will provide a geometric realization of Chiral Homology and extend this notion to curves with worse singularities.

Topology of 3 and 4-manifolds via bordered Floer homology,"If a small piece is cut out of the surface of a beach ball or the surface of an inner tube, the resulting bit of rubber can be flattened out to look like a piece of the two-dimensional Euclidean plane. (Picture a sheet of paper, or the top of a table). Both surfaces are examples of two-dimensional manifolds; although they locally look like the plane, they are globally different from it and from each other. This project studies three-dimensional manifolds, which describe the possible global shapes of the universe, and four-manifolds, which describe the possible shape of space-time, using mathematical tools related to the quantum theory of fields. There are many such topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), but amazingly almost everything one knows about smooth four-manifolds comes from studying a single TQFT. The project aims to understand this theory more deeply in the hopes of understanding why this is and if there are other TQFTs like it. Project funds will support graduate students and undergraduate students mentored by the PI. Building on his extensive previous experience with undergraduate summer research and industrial placements, the PI will make special efforts to recruit and support members of groups under-represented in mathematics. From a more technical standpoint, the project will study Floer homology for 3-manifolds and its applications to topology in dimensions 3 and 4. The main focus will be on understanding the Floer homology of 3-manifolds with boundary and how it fits into an extended TQFT. Project research will focus on three related areas. The first involves extending invariants developed in the PI's previous work with Hanselman and Watson to manifolds with several torus boundary components. This will be used to study the invariants of satellite knots. The second involves showing that these invariants fit into the wider structure of a 2-3-4 TQFT. This work will draw on ideas from symplectic geometry and the theory of extended TQFT’s. The third area involves a large, but poorly studied, class of 3-manifolds known as Floer simple manifolds. The PI will study the topology of these manifolds and their relation to hyperbolic geometry and the L-space conjecture.

RUI: Quantum Kinetics of Neutrinos: Leveraging the Universe at the Interface of Neutrino and Nuclear Astrophysics,"Neutrinos are the ghostly, shape-shifting enigmas of the Standard Model of particle physics. Trillions of neutrinos from the Sun pass through our bodies every second of the day. They don’t affect us, and most of them changed their identity -- their “flavor” -- while streaming from the core of the Sun. These interesting properties owe to their fundamental quantum mechanical nature; although all particles in the universe evolve quantum mechanically, the quantum effects are especially acute in the evolution of neutrinos. For decades, terrestrial experiments unveiled the properties of neutrinos. However, their ghost-like nature presents a significant barrier to fully elucidate the neutrino properties. By contrast, moments after the Big Bang the universe consisted of a primordial soup of fundamental particles so hot and dense that ghostly neutrinos nevertheless played an important role in the dynamics of the universe. This provides an opportunity to use the early universe as a complementary probe to explore neutrino physics. This project leverages upcoming cosmological observations and terrestrial neutrino experiments by performing high-fidelity simulations of neutrino evolution in the early universe. These investigations form an intriguing backdrop for the PI to train undergraduate student researchers, building skills that are valuable across a range of 21st century careers. Upcoming high-precision cosmological observations and neutrino laboratory experiments provide an opportune environment to explore questions in fundamental neutrino physics. Leveraging these advances requires high fidelity theoretical calculations to connect observation, experiment, and theory. This project explores the quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos through the hot and dense plasma of the early universe. This evolution is affected by coherent, unitary quantum mechanical behavior as well as decoherent inelastic scattering. In the early universe, large fluxes of neutrinos nonlinearly affect both the coherent quantum evolution and decoherent scattering through neutrino-neutrino interactions. Connecting cosmological observations to fundamental neutrino physics requires a self-consistent examination of the nonlinear quantum kinetic neutrino evolution because this evolution plays an important role in the dynamics of the expanding universe as well as the interconversion between protons and neutrons. The goal of this project is to solve the quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos in many theoretical scenarios in the early universe. In doing so, we look to build a broader understanding of this nonlinear evolution, to explore the astrophysical feedback and consequences of this evolution, and to aim toward leveraging the universe as a laboratory to study fundamental physics. This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.

RUI: Knot Theory and the Four-Sphere,"Understanding four-dimensional spaces holds significant scientific importance. It offers insights into fundamental theories like relativity and quantum mechanics, enhancing our conception of the structure and dynamics of the universe. Additionally, it enables exploration of complex phenomena such as higher-dimensional geometry, offering solutions to theoretical puzzles and practical challenges. Embracing the concept of four-dimensional spaces expands our intellectual horizons and has the potential to lead to advancements in technology and change how we interact with our surroundings. The focus of this research program is the study of knotted objects in dimension four and the connections that arise between the topology and geometry of the ambient four dimensional manifold and the knotted objects found within. This grant will allow the PI to carry out a robust program of undergraduate research, training, and mentoring; organize conferences, seminars, and an undergraduate math club; and implement student-centered teaching pedagogies. All of these activities help to create a new generation of researchers who will grapple with the challenging problem of understanding four-dimensional topology. The four-dimensional sphere is the simplest closed, four-dimensional manifold, yet it remains little understood in several important ways. First, it is unknown whether the four-sphere admits an exotic smooth structure, a question that has been settled in all other dimensions. Second, it is unknown whether a smoothly knotted two-sphere in the four-sphere with the same knot group as the unknotted two-sphere must itself be unknotted. Finally, it is unknown which four-manifolds arise as irregular three-fold covers of the four-sphere. This research program aims to make progress on these and important related problems through the study of knotted disks in homotopy four-balls; the diagrams of knotted surfaces in the four-sphere; and the topology, geometry, and symmetries of the four-manifolds obtained as branched covers over these surfaces.

Collective dynamics in Rydberg arrays,"In recent years, neutral atoms in tweezer arrays have gained prominence as scalable platforms for a variety of quantum technology applications, primarily due to the powerful collective dynamics offered by the Rydberg blockade mechanism. As the platform’s size continues to grow, there is an increasing theoretical emphasis on devising protocols that predominantly utilize global atom driving, given the persistent challenges associated with individual atom addressing. In this research proposal, the Applicant will deepen the understanding of the complex collective dynamics inherent to Rydberg arrays, with the objective of formulating innovative, scalable protocols that minimize the reliance on local controls. He will investigate a brand new set of dynamics, made accessible via the strategic inclusion of proper arrangement of atoms – superatoms and Rydberg gadgets – for quantum computation and optimization purposes, leveraging the Host’s deep expertise in the field.",198737,2025,2027,European Commission,Austria,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Proximity-induced magnetism and spin transport in graphene/magnetic oxide heterostructure interfaces,"Although graphene is known for its superlative electronic properties, it is intrinsically characterized by weak spin-orbit coupling and paramagnetic nature at low temperature. We propose to circumvent this issue by combining graphene with transition metal magnetic oxides (graphene/MO) in a unique series of artificially layered heterostructures. The presence of the magnetic oxide layer will allow us to investigate proximity induced magnetism and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in graphene due to the presence of high order d-orbitals and ensuing charge transfer induced hybridization. To that aim, perovskite manganate oxides will be initially investigated and then extended to cobalt or magnesium-based ferrites for room temperature applicability. Finally, we aim at fabricating novel graphene/MO-based heterostructure spin devices to test their feasibility for spin transport applications.",198737,2025,2027,European Commission,Austria,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
G-ray Array for Neutron Induced Inelastic Cross-Section measurements,"Neutron inelastic scattering measurements can be employed for the advancement of both fundamental research and applications. They are essential for the development of new generation nuclear energy systems, in particular for (n, xn) and (n, n’g) reactions which are important as they modify the neutron spectrum and population and produce radioactive species. In addition to nuclear technology applications neutron inelastic scattering measurements can also advance fundamental research providing information on nuclear reaction mechanisms since they are based on a non-selective method for studying nuclear excited states.
Such reactions can be studied through high-resolution gamma-spectroscopy as a function of the incoming neutron energy employing high purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors. The n_TOF facility hosted at CERN offers a very suitable beam line for such measurements offering a high instantaneous neutron flux in the neutron energy range of interest of 100 keV up to 100 MeV and an excellent neutron energy resolution due to a short driver beam width and a flight path of more than 180 metres. The n_TOF collaboration developed a prototype HPGe detector suited for this application and has performed test and proof-of-principle measurements already. 
The present project aims at developing a complete understanding of the existing detector and developing an optimised array of HPGe detectors for this application based on several potential physics cases. Such a setup will offer the opportunity for neutron inelastic measurements at n_TOF  and has the potential to provide high precision data for the nuclear community. Furthermore such an array can also be employed in neutron capture cross-section measurements as well as prompt fission gamma ray spectroscopy.",198737,2024,2026,European Commission,Austria,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Realization and Manipulation of a Planar hybrid superconducting Andreev spin qubit in GErmanium,"In the boiling field of quantum technology, the development of a stable, inherently shielded from perturbations quantum register is essential, yet remains elusive. Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices have been intensively studied, hunting for Majorana bound states towards topological quantum computing. While this goal has not yet been achieved, it has spurred material developments in III-V semiconductors, creating a new playground for spin qubits, resulting from the hybridization of the semiconductor and the superconductor in 1D Josephson junctions. Pioneering experiments recently demonstrated the manipulation of such a hybrid qubit, the Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), highlighting the potential of this approach. However, it is now reaching its limits due to the intrinsic properties of the host III-V semiconductor and the nanowire geometry, calling for a more suitable platform not demonstrated to date. In this proposal, I will tackle this challenge by fabricating a hybrid electrostatically tunable 1D Josephson junctions from a 2D germanium heterostructure. The first realization of a 1D Josephson weak ling on a planar Ge heterostructure will experimentally prove the possible integration of hybrid junctions, with resolved Andreev bound states. This device will enable the study of the spin-orbit interaction Hamiltonian for holes in 1D, a topic that remains largely unexplored leveraging microwave spectroscopy of Andreev bound states. Then, harnessing the unique properties of Ge, I will realize the first ASQ on a group IV semiconductor heterostructure. The proposed hybrid superconducting ASQ sets a significant milestone in the field, paving the way towards larger ensembles and enabling straightforward microwave connectivity using standard circuit quantum electrodynamic techniques. This harmoniously blends the benefits of semiconductor spin qubits with superconducting circuits, offering a promising path toward topologically protected qubits.",198737,2025,2027,European Commission,Austria,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Soft function Simulation and Evaluation of Real and Virtual Emissions for Non-GLobal observables,"""To facilitate the resummation of non-global logarithms and thereby enhancing theoretical predictions for collider phenomenology, I propose a project to calculate NNLO (order alpha_s^2) soft functions for non-global observables in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), using semi-numerical methods. The proposed framework consists of two steps: First, the universal structure of soft and collinear divergences in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is analysed to isolate singularities in an observable-independent fashion, after which the remaining phase space integrations are performed numerically. The objectives of the project are the release of a public software package for use by phenomenologists, and the use of the universal divergence structure to relate different classes of observables and shed light on properties of QCD factorisation (with the equivalence of virtuality and rapidity anomalous dimensions as a concrete example).

The project is structured into six work packages: WP1: application to SCET-1 (""""energy-type"""") observables without clustering effects,
WP2: SCET-1 with clustering effects, WP3: SCET-2 (""""transverse momentum-type"""") observables, WP4: development of a software
package, and WP5: Exploitation, WP6: communication, dissemination, and training.

The project is inspired by previous efforts directed at the much simpler """"global"""" observables. As non-global observables are less investigated yet ubiquitous in collider physics (e.g. jet observables), and resummation calculations for them are only regularly performed in the large Nc limit and at low logarithmic accuracy, a framework to calculate soft functions for wide swathes of observables can be of tremendous service to the community. The systematic separation of observable-dependent features from universal structures can also help shed light on fundamental properties of QCD factorisation, via e.g. an observable-independent analysis of Glauber modes and their impact on factorisation.""",198737,2024,2026,European Commission,Austria,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
The Mathematics of Interacting Particle Systems,"One of the great successes of modern science has been the understanding that simple objects can combine to form complicated structures. For instance, most of the matter that surrounds us is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These building blocks, taken individually, are rather simple, but, when enough of them interact with each other, they produce complex and varied structures, from the intricate patterns of tiny snowflakes to enormous spiraling galaxies. This is a very powerful idea: in principle, it suffices to understand the behavior of simple particles to derive everything. However, in practice, this is a very challenging task, as keeping track of large numbers of interacting particles is impossibly difficult. Instead, sophisticated techniques need to be developed to extract the relevant collective behaviors. This project consists in developing and investigating several such techniques. This project focuses on three types of particle systems, both classical and quantum, which exhibit different types of collective behavior. The first is a model of interacting quantum particles called Bosons. This is a toy model for helium atoms, which are known to form a superfluid phase at low temperature, in which the helium flows without viscosity. The principal investigator (PI) is studying the so-called ""Simplified Approach"", which has been shown to reproduce much of the complex behavior of the interacting Bose gas, while being much more tractable. The second is a classical model in which the PI is proving the existence of crystalline phases, in which infinite large-scale regular patterns spontaneously emerge. The third is a model of interacting quantum particles called Fermions. This is a toy model for the electrons in conductors, which are known to form a superconducting phase at low temperature, in which electricity flows without resistance. The PI is investigating ""hierarchical models"", for which exact solutions can be found, and complex behavior can be proved. This project includes a significant educational component at various levels. The PI is developing graduate, undergraduate, and master's level courses that incorporate the techniques developed in the project, thus introducing students to the tools and techniques of mathematical research. In addition, the PI is producing and distributing educational videos aimed at high school students, undergraduates, and the general public, which are informed by the PI's perspective as a researcher. In addition, the PI is involved in a project to design new mathematical reasoning courses at Rutgers, based on the formal proof assistant called ""Lean"". This project lies in the field of mathematical physics and aims to develop new tools and refine existing ones to analyze the effect of interactions in a systematic and mathematically rigorous way. Specifically, it consists of the analysis of three types of systems: interacting Bose gases, classical hard-core particle models at high density, and interacting lattice Fermi gases. To analyze the interacting Bose gas, the PI is investigating the ""Simplified Approach"", which is a nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equation (PDE) in three dimensions. Its analysis has yielded very promising results: it reproduces all known and conjectured behavior of the Bose gas for all densities. The objectives of this part are to solve the more important problems that are still open about this PDE and study its relation to the original many-Boson problem. The PI has developed a framework to study a large class of hard-core particle models at high density and prove that these behave like crystals in that regime. The objectives of this part are to extend the family of hard-core particle models for which we can rigorously prove ordering phase transitions to include three dimensional models, liquid crystals, as well as continuum models. To study interacting lattice Fermi gases, the PI is using the Renormalization Group (RG), which is a powerful tool to study systems of interacting quantum particles, but it is notoriously difficult to implement. The PI has introduced a family of models for which the RG analysis can be carried out easily, rigorously, and exactly, and nontrivial properties can be proved. The main objective of this part is to define and study Fermionic hierarchical models that exhibit superconductivity.

As part of the NOvA Exotics Group, this group will continue the search for fundamental particles with a special emphasis on slow magnetic monopole searches. In addition to this basic research, this project will give undergraduate students the opportunity to experience the international world of particle physics. Students will participate in a one-year program where they will be instructed in particle physics techniques and research, participate in the already successful study abroad program of European particle detectors (e.g. CERN), and travel to Fermilab to learn about the domestic particle physics program.

A nano-electromechanical quantum simulator,"Electron-phonon interactions lead to a plethora of phenomena in strongly correlated solid-state systems such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. However, the complex dynamics manifesting these phases can be beyond the reach of computational modelling, especially when taking into account electron-electron interaction. Therefore, one of the outstanding challenges in the field of correlated-electron physics is a widely tuneable model system that can mutually couple several electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. To date, no such system has been experimentally realized. While previous efforts have mostly focused on cold-atom configurations, nano-electromechanical systems are naturally suited to address this challenge. One of the most challenging requirements to engineering such a system is the achievement of ultrastrong electromechanical coupling, which has been recently demonstrated for the first time in a capacitively coupled carbon nanotube. Leveraging this capability, we propose to engineer a model system in which electronic degrees of freedom are defined within four quantum dots and coupled to vibrational modes of a carbon nanotube. If successful, the project will enable the first experimental platform for quantum simulation of electron-phonon coupling. The proposal combines techniques from different fields to create a hybrid quantum system that significantly extends the state-of-the-art in nano-electromechanics. The Quantum NanoElectronics & NanoMechanics group at ICFO is one of the two only research groups to experimentally demonstrate ultrastrong electromechanical coupling to date and is the world leader in the fabrication of ultraclean carbon nanotubes. These capabilities, combined with my strong background in both experimental and theoretical nanomechanics, place us in a unique position to realize this milestone.",196091,2024,2025,European Commission,Spain,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Engineering Spin-Splitting in Atomically Thin 2D Non-Centrosymmetric Crystals,"The information technology and communication sector (ICT) has been undergoing remarkable progress fuelled by integrational advancements in its building blocks, the field effect transistor (FET). The FETs in commercials microprocessors still use more than half a century old energy-intensive conductance switching processes to perform logic operations. It is well understood that the inability to remove the dissipated energy in such switching process will eventually stop the ongoing downscaling of the microprocessors in the next few years. Spintronic-based devices, working by virtue of energy efficient switching the spin-polarization, are considered to bring a paradigm shift in logic operations. Such devices use charge-to-spin interconversion (CSI) which is maximized in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The main goal of ACCESS is to engineer inversion symmetry and SOC in vertical heterostructures of two-dimensional layered materials (2DLMs) to facilitate the CSI process. We shall fabricate dual gated hBN encapsulated FETs using the 1T' phase of transitional metal dichalcogenides and its twisted bilayers to tune symmetry and SOC. ACCESS will exploit the Edelstein effect and intrinsic Berry curvature dipole to generate current-induced magnetization and detect it via unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) and nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) measurements. The CSI in our samples will be further tuned by dynamically varying vertical displacement field and the charge carrier density in the channel. By this way, ACCESS will harness the topological properties of  2DLMs for applications in future spintronics devices, capable of magnet-free spin-to-charge interconversion. Besides its scientific goals, ACCESS also focuses on strengthening the researcher’s transferable skills and providing him a high-quality interdisciplinary research training, helping him to build a promising scientific research career.",196091,2024,2025,European Commission,Spain; Netherlands,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
Interactions among Coherent Objects and the Origin of Collectivity in QCD at Colliders,"The surprising findings of collective effects in nucleon-nucleus and nucleon-nucleon collisions (and very recently even in electron-positron collisions), previously thought to be exclusive to large systems such as nucleus-nucleus collisions, pose an important challenge to the particle physics community. Both from the heavy-ion and the high-energy communities, intense efforts are devoted to gain a better understanding of the origin of collectivity in QCD. This project revolves around the theoretical study of the interactions among coherent objects and their phenomenological implications. So far, these type of interactions have been absent in the respective state-of-the-art descriptions of the dynamical evolution of QCD at colliders adopted by both communities. The first goal of this project will be to compute the cross-sections for a new set of processes, ranging from the interaction of on-shell particles with colored dipoles to the interactions among dipoles with other dipoles. As a result of these interactions, broadening and stimulated radiation can take place. The features of the dipoles, such as their mass, are imprinted in the scattered object due to the phenomenon of color and quantum interference. These physics translate in the appearance of non-trivial correlations among these objects. A second aspect of the project will consist in the phenomenological modeling that these correlations can have in a) QCD parton showers, the natural scenario from the high-energy front, where interactions among parton and multi-parton objects will be added to the typical splitting processes and b) QCD effective kinetic theory, the natural scenario from the heavy-ion front, where the inclusion of the coherent objects can be modeled by considering them as unstable particles. A detailed study of the observable effects that these new correlations can induce will shed light on the role played by the physics of quantum interference in describing the origin of collectivity in QCD.",196090,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Advanced Fast-Ion Loss Measurements at the JT-60SA and ITER tokamaks,"One of the main challenges towards the commercialization of fusion energy is the appropriate confinement of alpha particles in burning plasmas as well as fast ions generated by auxiliary heating systems. 
This project contributes to that objective by aiming at the temporal and velocity-space characterization of fast-ion losses in the most advanced tokamak experiments (ITER and JT-60SA).
i) Commissioning of a Fast-Ion Loss Detector (FILD) and its installation at the JT-60SA tokamak, including the synthesis of its scintillator plate, testing of its reciprocating system, optical calibration and assessment of its structural integrity.
ii) Assessing the escaping fast ions generated by the 500keV N-NBI at JT-60SA. These unprecedented time-resolved velocity-space measurements under different regimes of operation will be validated using Hamiltonian full-orbit simulations. Moreover, advanced, first-principle hybrid kinetic-MHD modeling with the MEGA code will be used to reproduce the losses induced by Alfvénic instabilities.
iii) Designing the ITER FILD and developing the technical solutions required to survive the harsh conditions at the ITER first wall.  This includes thermo-mechanical assessment of the probe head, a synthetic diagnostic to estimate the signals, and the development of a scintillator plate with tolerable noise and degradation induced by neutrons and gamma radiation.
This action is carried out at the Plasma Science and Fusion Technology group of the University of Seville in close collaboration with the ITER Organization, EUROfusion Consortium and JT-60SA teams. It includes two two-month secondments at QST (Japan) to install and exploit the JT-60SA FILD.

Integrated Quantum Repeater Nodes,"Recent breakthroughs in the field of quantum technologies combining academic and R&D efforts have demonstrated the potential of quantum networks for major applications such as long-distance secure communication or quantum cloud computing. One current challenge is to deploy quantum networks out of the lab for realizing their expected far-reaching societal and economic impact. A crucial requirement for reaching this goal is the realization of a quantum repeater that will be able to extend quantum links to continental distances. In this context, the use of integrated photonic platforms, allowing for low-footprint, alignment-free and mass-manufacturable quantum nodes, represents a significant resource for real-life applications of quantum networks. In this proposal, we provide a route for achieving this goal through the integration of rare-earth quantum memories on fiber-pigtailed glass photonic chips. This technology enables the storage of single photons in a platform that is compatible with integrated photonic circuits used to perform quantum gates and computations. We will demonstrate for the first time on-demand retrieval of photons in an all-fiber quantum memory then build the first elementary integrated quantum memory node with a multi-memory photonic chip that could readily be embedded in a DLCZ-like quantum repeater architecture. The goals set in this proposal are important milestones towards the achievement of robust application-ready quantum networks and the establishment of a European quantum internet.",196090,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain; Italy,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Harnessing Quantum Resources in Network Communication and Their Thermodynamic Underpinnings,"We are currently at the midst of Second Quantum Revolution, a transformative era harnessing various quantum resources for the efficient execution of communication and computational tasks previously unattainable through classical means. During the recent past the point-to-point communication scenarios have seen extensive exploration and practical realization of quantum resource benefits across diverse quantum architectures. Within the realm of network scenario, typical communication systems involve multiple distant parties seeking to exchange information. In the present project, our primary objective is to delve into the advantageous applications of several quantum resources, including quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum nonlocal correlations, in the context of network communications. Our focus is particularly directed at two broad channel categories in the network scenario: the Multiple Access Channel (MAC), featuring multiple senders and a single receiver, and the Broadcasting Channel (BC), comprising one sender and multiple receivers. A fundamental goal lies in examining how distinct non-classical correlations, achieved from multipartite quantum systems, can enhance the effectiveness of the limited communication channels available to both senders and receivers. In this endeavor, we intend to uncover a deeper connection between quantum information theory and quantum thermodynamics. While the intricate link between these domains has been highlighted by the work of Szilard, Landauer, and Bennett, our aim is to explore this connection within the quantum realm to its broadest extent, with a specific focus on network communication scenarios. In addition to introducing a novel avenue for quantifying and detecting quantum resources through experimentally measurable thermodynamic quantities, this undertaking also offers insights into why quantum theory holds a special status among mathematically allowed models.",196090,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Thermo-spin 3D Platform for Skyrmion motion.,"The overall power consumption of information technology accounts for almost 10% of the global energy demands and it is predicted to reach 20% in 2030. As a result, we need new ways to store and compute data utilizing more efficient and environmentally cleaner alternatives to current technologies, and the EU should be leading this transformation. The development of a low-power non-volatile memory is one of the most sought-after technologies and racetrack memories based on topological magnetic Skyrmions are one of the most promising candidates. There are, however, several drawbacks for spintronic devices based on Skyrmions: their trajectories under currents are nontrivial; the thermal contribution to Skyrmion motion is yet to be well understood, and fully electrical detection of Skyrmions is challenging due to the small contribution of the topology to the Hall effect. 
In 3D-Sky, I propose to take advantage of state-of-the-art 3D nanopatterning to obtain fine control over the energy landscape for the motion of Skyrmions in 3D racetracks. For this, I will exploit the precise and unique tuning of thermal and geometrical properties that 3D devices enable to decouple the nanostructure from the substrate opening the possibility to use much higher temperature gradients to tackle the main drawbacks of Skyrmion racetrack memories. In short, in 3D-Sky I aim to create a platform for Skyrmion motion based on 3D nanodevices focusing on the impact of temperature on their dynamics, nucleation and properties. This will provide the fundamental knowledge needed to understand thermal-driven Skyrmion motion in different systems including the different driving forces in play. Furthermore, I will tackle the current challenges in reliable nucleation and electrical detection of Skyrmions taking advantage of the singular properties of 3D nanostructures for the creation of defects and efficient heating.",196090,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain; Austria; France,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Development of bottom-up custom-functionalized graphene/porphyrin nanoarchitectures with atomic precision,"The ongoing miniaturization of electronic devices has been raising awareness for the need to develop alternative high-performance and energy-efficient semiconductor materials. The current project (GRAPHYRIN) aims to synthesize new atomically precise hybrid nanoarchitectures, comprising graphene nanostructures (graphene nanoribbons, GNRs, or nanoporous graphene, NPG) and porphyrins (PORs), with promising properties to fabricate next-generation materials to be used, for example, in gas sensing electronic devices. First, multistage organic synthesis will be carried out to obtain individual or fused precursors of GNRs and PORs (“seeding stages”), which will later allow the construction of partially and fully conjugated hybrid systems. Here, we will synthesize appropriate bianthracence-based reactants (or equivalent derivatives) as molecular building blocks of GNRs and, in parallel, several PORs (tetra- or di-substituted) with appropriate structural features to functionalize GNRs. Alternatively, POR-fused GNRs hybrid precursors will be synthesized via direct functionalization of PORs with GNRs precursors or via synthesis of GNRs precursors bearing aldehyde groups. Several polymerization strategies will be explored (“growing stages”), using in-solution synthesis (ISS) or on-surface synthesis (OSS), namely on Au(111) surfaces. The polymerization reactions will involve, for example, Suzuki or Ullmann coupling. Depending on the properties of the starting GNRs and POR precursors, the final structures may either be one- or two-dimensional (1D GNRs/PORs or 2D NPG/PORs, respectively). Finally, the successfully synthesized hybrid materials will be explored as gas sensors for future electronic devices. It is expected that the outcomes from GRAPHYRIN will allow to go beyond the state-of-the-art and take a step further towards the synthesis of new custom-made graphene/POR nanoarchitectures for ideal gas sensing electronic devices.",196090,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics

Formation and evolution of cyclic molecules in the interstellar medium,"During the last years, we have witnessed an evermore increase in the number of molecules detected in the region between stars, the interstellar medium, where new stars are born. 

Of the different families of molecules to which the new astronomical detections belong, cyclic and aromatic molecules are particularly puzzling for astrochemistry. Although they are ubiquitous in Earth-based chemistry, the positive detection of aromatic species in the interstellar medium came only a few years ago. This finding has initiated a wave of detections that reveal as many answers as pose new vital questions. For example, aromatic species are critical in the formation of prebiotic molecules. Hence, detecting these molecules presents significant, far-reaching implications for questions beyond astronomy, such as the origin of life on our planet.

In this project, we will determine the main formation routes of cyclic and aromatic molecules in the interstellar medium and the main destruction and conversion pathways that these molecules undertake once formed. We will pursue the project using first principles computer simulations, aiming to disentangle the physical and chemical basis for the origin of these species. Our goal is to find sources of molecular diversity in our universe, constrain the maximum chemical complexity expected in space for cyclic species, and determine how these molecules could be delivered to planets such as the Earth.",196089,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Tracing galaxy evolution with Nuclear Structures in Late-type galaxies,"Central regions of galaxies are inhabited by dense small structures, such as nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and nuclear disks and rings. These, at the bottom of the galactic potential well, are important tracers of the overall galaxy evolution, but the dominant mechanisms of their formation in galaxies of different masses and morphologies are still unclear. The TraNSLate project (Tracing galaxy evolution with Nuclear Structures in Late-type galaxies) will shed light on this issue, combining high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations with state-of-the-art integral-field spectroscopy observations. TraNSLate will be conclusive on the role of gas accretion and inflow followed by nuclear in-situ star formation, and stellar accretion and migration to the center of a galaxy. First, I will quantify the relative contribution of these processes in the central regions of 50 simulated galaxies. I will identify potential nuclear structures and unveil how they formed going back in time to previous snapshots of simulations. Secondly, I will focus on NSCs in observations of eight massive late-type galaxies (so far poorly studied), and their properties will be interpreted with the help of recipes provided by simulations. Finally, since higher resolution than current state of the art is needed to detect the smallest NSCs, TraNSLate will deliver one NSC-oriented pilot simulation, with a factor of 10 higher resolution, and a detailed plan for a future complete run of 20 more simulations. The TraNSLate project will be carried out at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias under the supervision of Dr. C. Brook, expert on theoretical studies on the formation of galactic structures in a cosmological context. The theoretical expertise of the supervisor and the host research group is very complementary to my observational background, and with this fellowship I will acquire a complete, versatile and mature profile as a scientist, in a position to pursue long-term leadership positions.",196089,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences
QUANTum mixtures In FLat And Curved geometries,"Ultracold quantum gases allowed to realize experimentally several paradigmatic models of theoretical physics, such as nonrelativistic bosons and fermions with zero-range interactions. One of the issues driving the last decades of research on quantum gases was understanding how, from these fundamental models, macroscopic structures and quantum phenomena emerge. Along this direction, the most recent advances of the field include the discovery of dilute quantum droplets and supersolidity in gases with long-range interactions. A great deal of experimental and theoretical attention is now directed at identifying novel phases of multi-component Bose or Fermi mixtures with different compositions, different types of interactions, and in various geometries. 

The QUANTIFLAC project will analyze low-dimensional Bose-Bose and Fermi-Fermi mixtures of ultracold quantum gases, with the goal of engineering minimally-complicated microscopic models displaying exotic many-body effects. We plan to study emergent inhomogeneous structures in bosonic mixtures and self-binding in fermionic mixtures, aiming to determine whether this type of phenomena can be driven exclusively by structureless zero-range interactions. We will also investigate Bose-Bose mixtures confined in various curved geometries, to understand how the interplay of curvature, boundary conditions and topology regulates the macroscopic quantum behavior of the system. 

This theoretical project has tight connections with various established experimental groups: its results will raise immediate interest and have far-reaching implications for the quantum simulation of matter with ultracold atomic mixtures and for the fundamental understanding of macroscopic quantum aggregates.",196089,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Next generation environmentally friendly intraband active colloidal quantum dots and their ultrafast carrier dynamics for mid infrared photodetector,"Infrared technology has found widespread applications across various fields, including remote controls, telecommunications networks, and thermal imaging etc. Traditional semiconductor alloys like indium gallium arsenide, mercury cadmium telluride and indium antimonide have been commonly employed as active materials in infrared devices. However, the manufacturing and assembly processes for these materials are highly complex and costly. To overcome these challenges and potentially replace expensive epitaxially fabricated devices, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a promising alternative. In contemporary scientific exploration, there has been a surge of interest in narrow bandgap CQDs, thanks to their remarkable capacity to finely adjust excitonic transitions within the mid-wave infrared (mid-IR) spectrum. The discovery of intraband transition (1Se/h-1Pe/h) has opened as an alternative source of narrow energy transition occurs in the quantized conduction/valence band states of CQDs. Numerous research groups have extensively investigated the fundamental aspects and practical applications of HgE (where E = S, Se, and Te) CQDs.
Leveraging numerous recent scientific breakthroughs in the domain of intraband (1Se-1Pe) active colloidal quantum dots, we will integrate state-of-the-art material processing techniques across chemistry, physics, and engineering.  We will assess the dynamics of charge carriers through the utilization of femtosecond mid-IR transient absorption spectroscopy.  In addition, we will focus on optimizing the required surface environment capable of maintaining intraband transitions under ambient conditions, at the same time offering adequate optoelectronic properties (mobility, conductivity) for their implementation in photodetector devices. Ultimately, our objective is to produce mid-IR photodetector devices incorporating the highly compatible non- toxic Ag2Se and core-shell CQDs.",196089,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
Innovative Model-based Plasma Algorithms for Control of spherical Tokamaks,"The huge mass of a star and its associated gravitational forces make the nuclei of hydrogen atoms collide and fuse, releasing energy in the form of energetic neutrons. This process, called nuclear fusion, has a very high energy density, and does not produce CO2 or long-lived radioactive waste. For these reasons, nuclear fusion has attracted the attention of scientists since the 1950s, who have tried to reproduce the conditions of a star in their laboratories. So far, tokamaks are the most promising prototype for a nuclear-fusion power plant on Earth. In particular, spherical tokamaks provide an attractive configuration due to their compactness and lower cost than conventional tokamaks. This would provide a means to mitigate the actual climate and energy crisis, using nuclear fusion to complement other renewable energies in a greener future.

Control of the tokamak plant and associated systems, whose final goal is to confine a plasma by means of magnetic fields, is critical to attain the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to happen. However, plasma control in spherical tokamaks requires specific solutions due to their challenging plasma shapes and pressures, which often trigger plasma instabilities. Under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions, the IMPACT project (Innovative Model-based Plasma Algorithms for Control of spherical Tokamaks) will design a state-of-the-art plasma-control system for spherical tokamaks and will deploy it on the SMall Aspect Ratio Tokamak (SMART). Under this project, novel algorithms based on plasma dynamical models will be developed to tackle the newest control challenges in spherical tokamaks, including negative triangularity plasma shaping to enable higher plasma confinement and ensure safety of the tokamak reactor. This project will ensure the realization and sustainment of the plasmas needed in SMART, thus enabling and accelerating its scientific and technological mission to make nuclear fusion a reality.",196089,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Collaborative Research: Breaking Barriers in Multi-messenger Astrophysics: The RITTU Partnership,"A new research and education partnership in astronomy will be developed between the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and Texas Tech University (TTU) with the aim of exploring how to break both disciplinary and cultural boundaries to solve key questions in neutron-star astrophysics. RIT hosts the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, one of the premier deaf education institutes in the world and TTU is a Hispanic Serving Institution. The two-year program will explore authentic pathways for Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing and Hispanic undergraduate students to join the RITTU partnership and participate in academic year preparation programs and summer research experiences. The students will acquire a set of skills that cross between theory and observations and will be supported by a dedicated mentoring team, thereby placing them in competitive positions for graduate programs or other STEM careers. The next few years will herald a golden age for the astrophysics of neutron stars, which are compact stellar objects, often synonymous with pulsars, and which are one of the end stages of massive star evolution. Neutron stars and mergers of binary neutron stars can be observed through multiple messengers: gravitational waves (GWs), electromagnetic radiation and potentially neutrinos—offering unparalleled opportunities to answer fundamental questions in astrophysics. The program will involve two inter-related studies. The study of binary neutron star mergers will reveal the formation mechanism of the Universe’s heaviest elements, probe the generation and structure of the most powerful astrophysical jets, and elucidate the characteristics of the remnant population of massive stellar evolution. In the topic of neutron star astrophysics, the team will develop new tools to shed light on pulsar glitches and use pulsar timing observations to guide searches for burst and continuous GWs.

Dynamics and Symmetry in Quantum Gravity,"An important question facing fundamental physics is how the well-tested laws of Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics are consistent - the question of quantum gravity. This question is central to understanding the very origin of our universe, the Big Bang, as well as for understanding the final fate of black holes. The award seeks to bridge the gap between the full theory of loop quantum gravity (LQG) and simplified models of cosmology and black holes based on LQG that have been recently successful in making potential observational predictions. Such a bridge would allow future comparisons of such models with data to tell us exact details about the fundamental laws of quantum gravity. A second part of this research aims to answer key questions regarding the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation of loop quantum gravity, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way, and to bring this formulation closer to completion. By enabling graduate students to participate in frontier physics, and to interact with other research groups, this award will have a broad and long-term impact on the development of future scientists. The results of the research will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications and scientific lectures, as well as to the general public through public lectures. The observational consequences, for both cosmology and black holes, of different possible dynamics in LQG will be determined. To accomplish this, the PI will first find an embedding of states from the appropriate simplified quantum model - Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) or Loop Quantum Kantowski-Sachs (LQKS) - into diffeomorphism-invariant LQG states that satisfy the quantum criterion for homogeneity and isotropy recently established by the PI’s group. This embedding will enable different possible dynamics in LQG to be translated into LQC and LQKS, and thereby to distinguish their observational consequences using established methods. The task of finding the corresponding LQC/LQKS dynamics is simplified by the severe restriction on the resulting possibilities proven, over the last 6 years by the PI’s group, from diffeomorphism invariance. The PI additionally plans to further develop the sum over histories approach to LQG, known as spin-foams. In prior work of the PI, the prevailing EPRL model of spin-foams was modified to correct its semiclassical limit, yielding the `proper spin-foam model’. Efficient numerical methods will be developed to perform calculations using this model. Possibilities for solving long-standing issues in spin foams, as well as applications to the thermodynamics of the quantum gravitational field, will be explored.

On Enumerative and Tautological Invariants Defined by Perfect Obstruction Theories,"This project focuses on two related topics in algebraic geometry, which are motivated by their connections with physical theories (string theory and gauge theory). The first topic is Donaldson-Thomas (DT) and Vafa-Witten (VW) theory, which studies the invariants of the space parametrizing sets of solutions of polynomials defining two dimensional objects with certain topological constraints in a space. The second topic is higher dimensional Gromov-Witten (GW) theory, which roughly speaking is about a systematic way of counting numbers of surfaces with particular constraints in a space defined by a set of polynomial equations. For a real dimension four space, a remarkable conjecture of electromagnetic duality (S-duality) from physics says that counting two dimensional objects in a topological space has nice modularity properties. Different branches of mathematics are linked together by these two theories and deep properties of geometric objects have been uncovered by calculating invariants. In this project the PI will investigate the S-duality conjecture between these two theories and relate them to other branches of mathematics and physics. This award will also support graduate student research. In more detail, the projects are designed to define several new enumerative invariants of the moduli spaces of geometric objects in algebraic geometry. The first topic is Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten theory. The PI will study DT invariants for Calabi-Yau 4-folds, apply the DT invariants to prove the S-duality conjecture for real four and six dimensional manifolds. The second topic is higher dimensional Gromov-Witten theory. The PI will study GW counting surface invariants, construct the moduli space of surface case stable maps and the virtual fundamental class, and use the virtual fundamental class to define tautological invariants and study the original GW invariants of counting curves. This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

Nonlinear PDE in Complex Geometry,"The existence of canonical metrics has been an active research focus in geometry over the last century with immediate ties to the fields of general relativity and string theory. Canonical metrics can provide valuable insight into the specific geometry of geometric objects called manifolds. An example of canonical metrics are solutions to the Einstein field equations which relate the geometry of a spacetime, specifically the curvature, with the distribution of matter, energy and stress. In complex geometry, Calabi-Yau metrics, which are those with zero Ricci curvature, are a prime example of canonical metrics and their existence is directly related to solving a particular nonlinear partial differential equation called the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The equations of unified string theories are expected to yield new notions of canonical metrics as well as special geometries. This project aims to further our understanding of the existence of certain canonical metrics by developing necessary tools and new techniques in partial differential equations. Furthermore, the project will continue the PI's involvement in mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and organizing numerous seminars and conferences, with an emphasis on the inclusion of women and under-represented groups. The project will pursue a program in which the PI will investigate several geometric problems related to canonical metrics on a complex manifold and the classification of algebraic varieties using the methods of nonlinear partial differential equations. One of the main goals is to prove existence of constant scalar curvature Hermitian metrics by obtaining a priori estimates and applying them to glean insight into the geometry of the complex manifold through the use of a continuity path or parabolic flow approach. In addition, the PI would like to transform our understanding of canonical metrics on a given manifold to the problem of searching for a family of canonical metrics given by the process of reducing a complex manifold to its minimal model, as per Mori's Minimal Model program, and the Analytic Minimal Model program by Song-Tian.

Static and Dynamic aproaches: A Unified Framework for Predicting Quantum Yields of Excited State Processes,"Light is at the heart of many critical processes, from photon-to-energy conversion to photosynthesis. Common among those fields is that, upon excitation, a molecule has to release energy to return to the ground state. However, deciphering how molecules release this energy is a complex puzzle involving navigating a maze of all the possible deactivation pathways. As more excited states and photoproducts are involved, this puzzle becomes more intricate. All these pathways compete, and the excited-state decay rates dictate the entire photochemistry of the system. To advance light-related applications, we must unravel and map these possibilities. For the same system, we could have thermally and non-thermally equilibrated processes taking place, as well as competing processes spawning from a few femtoseconds up to seconds, thus encompassing this entire spectrum of processes remains a formidable challenge in computational chemistry, demanding radically different approaches: the static and dynamic approaches. In this project, I face this challenge by combining diverse strategies for computing decay rate constants in excited states. The overarching objective is constructing a unified framework that seamlessly merges static and dynamic methodologies. This integration will enable predictions of crucial parameters like fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes. The roadmap to success involves the development of two distinct protocols. In the integrated-based protocol, I will combine excited-state decay rate theories and nonadiabatic dynamics to accurately compute individual decay rate constants. In the independent-based protocol, I will explore the independent utilization of static and dynamic approaches to compute rates independently, subsequently synthesizing these data to understand photochemical behavior. This proposal is poised to revolutionize our comprehension of photochemical processes, transcending the boundaries of current state-of-the-art methodologies.",190420,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium; United Kingdom,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
All Magneto-Electric Spin Logic Gates,"The surge in electronic equipment used daily across the globe, from end-user devices to data centres, has led to a craving for more energy-efficient computing devices. However, the current Moore’s Law epitomised miniaturisation process of CMOS transistors will be gradually limited by increasing power densities and associated chip heating. Therefore, much research has been devoted to the development of alternative computing devices. 

Spintronic devices, which exploit both the charge and the spin of electrons, are seen as a promising beyond-CMOS approach due to their ultralow energy per operation, non-volatility, and capability to build more expressive logic gates. Despite much recent success in realizing spintronic logic gates such as those that employ magnetic domain walls or spin waves as information carriers, there are two major limitations that impede the inclusion of such devices in microelectronic technologies. The first is the lack of energy-efficient transducers for interconversion of signals between the magnetic and electrical domains. The second issue is the inability to propagate magnetic information carriers over large distances in the magnetic domain, i.e., the lack of magnetic interconnect. 

To address these challenges, we propose a novel spin logic device concept (ALLME) based on layered strain-mediated magnetoelectric composites containing both piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. By exploiting its magnetoelectric effect, the magnetisation in a nanomagnet can be rotated with voltages, and in the inverse effect, the change in magnetisation will result in a voltage output. ALLME aims to deliver one of the most technologically competitive spin logic concepts, with an emphasis on ultra-low energy consumption and all charge-based interconnects that are readily to be cascaded in complex logic circuits, to solve the long-standing challenges in spin logic.",190420,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
Dimensional Insights into Dissipative Kerr Solitons,"The ENLIGHTENS project focuses on investigating how dimensions influence the dynamics, stability, and characteristics of dissipative solitons (DS) within externally driven multimode Kerr cavities. DS are fascinating localized structures that maintain their inherent shapes during propagation, owing to a delicate balance between the nonlinear Kerr effect, linear dispersion/diffraction, gain, and dissipative processes. These states retain their temporal profiles along the propagation direction, forming temporal solitons, or preserve spatial profiles orthogonal to the propagation direction, leading to the emergence of spatial solitons. Spatiotemporal solitons (STDS) represent a class of states that not only maintain spatial but also temporal profiles, exhibiting complex dynamics. However, such states tend to be vulnerable to wave collapse. In this context, the ENLIGHTENS project seeks to explore the dimensional aspects affecting the stability of DS as dimensions increase and develop strategies to enhance their stability. My preliminary findings suggest that phase modulation has the potential to expand the stability range within 1D temporal DS and could potentially stabilize 3D STDS.  Within this framework, I will further conduct a comprehensive bifurcation analysis of these 1D temporal dissipative states under various influences, laying the groundwork for further investigation. Subsequently, I will focus on the transition of these 1D states by introducing spatial effects as a weak perturbation that later becomes a dominant factor in the system. This methodology enables me to progressively tackle increasing complexity, facilitating the study of high-dimensional problems in a step-by-step fashion. Understanding these states holds paramount significance and carries the potential for groundbreaking advancements across diverse technological domains, including the development of innovative multidimensional Kerr frequency combs.",190420,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium,EU,Quantum Physics
Tailoring of Polar Topologies with Optical Pulses,"The past decade has witnessed dramatic progress related to the emergence of different topological polar textures in oxide nanostructures such as vortices, skyrmions, merons, hopfions, among others. These exotic phases are opening new technological perspectives due to their exotic functional properties like negative capacitance, chirality or ultrafast dynamical response. In addition, the fact that these states are metastable and thus non-volatile, allows to consider them as multiweights, that one can exploit in artificial neuromorphic synapses. 
The main goal of the collaboration between the researcher and the host group is to perform first-principles based effective atomic potential simulations (retrieving all the structural degrees of freedom) of topological phases interacting with electric pulses from a truly quantum-mechanical point of view to tailor the resulting polar ordering. A key novelty of this proposal and the ambitious objective that it pursues, is to study and characterize, from a fundamental point of view, the phonon modes active in the different topological orderings to figure out the relevant modes to be excited and be able to design concrete pulses that provide a deterministic control of the resulting effect on the polar ordering of the material. Other current approaches to the problem only rely on the coupling between two or three modes with their interactions fitted from DFT. Therefore, a full atomistic view of the problem would be desired. Due to the promising technologically relevant results on the near horizon, a deeper and more advanced theoretical inspection without the omission of atomic degrees of freedom that might be relevant for the description of the material is needed with urgency. This project directly tackles these needs. Although being a theoretical work collaboration with leading experimental groups at UCL and UNIGE will be pursued in order to validate the theoretical model and increase the technology readiness level of the project",190420,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium; Switzerland; United Kingdom,EU,Quantum Physics
"Holonomy, symmetry and geometric flows","The geometric objects that can be perceived by our senses are curves and surfaces. Submanifolds provide a natural generalization for higher dimensions of these objects. The focus of this project is on totally geodesic submanifolds and isoparametric hypersurfaces, intriguing classes of submanifolds with connections to various mathematical areas, often studied using differential geometric, algebraic, or topological methods.

The aim of this project is to investigate the interplay of totally geodesic submanifolds with Riemannian holonomy and isoparametric hypersurfaces with certain geometric flows, with the ultimate goal of obtaining results of both intrinsic and extrinsic nature. Specifically, we intend to complete the classifications of totally geodesic submanifolds in symmetric spaces and of homogeneous hypersurfaces in exceptional symmetric spaces. We will also use certain classes of isoparametric hypersurfaces in combination with maximum principles to try to prove an Alexandrov-type theorem in the complex hyperbolic space and long-time existence for the hypersymplectic flow.

To develop this project, the Experienced Researcher will join the Geometric Analysis team at ULB in Brussels, under the supervision of one of its main researchers, Joel Fine. The host group has extensive experience in the study of manifolds with special holonomy and geometric flows, using techniques from PDE theory. The training strategy of this project involves assimilating these techniques. Moreover, the ER has experience in the classical theory of submanifolds in symmetric spaces, as evidenced by his contributions to the field. The combination of both backgrounds is essential for developing this proposal.

Finally, this MSCA fellowship will enhance the convergence of distinct research fields and collaborative networks, generate synergy with the research performed by the Supervisor, diversify the fellow’s mathematical knowledge, and establish him as an independent researcher.",190420,2024,2026,European Commission,Belgium,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Studies of Nucleons at Fermilab and PSI,"Although the proton has been studied for over 100 years, it still is not fully understood. Until about 15 years ago, there seemed to be agreement among various experiments for how large the proton is. All that came into question when an experiment using muons, the heavy cousins of the electrons, displayed a large, unexplained discrepancy in the size of the proton compared to using electrons. This discrepancy was entirely unexpected, as the proton's size should not depend on whether it is measured with electrons or muons. This became known as the proton radius puzzle. The main physics program supported by this award is an attempt at solving this 14-year old puzzle about the real size of the proton. This research program will train a postdoctoral fellow on cryogenic techniques and targets. The involvement of junior researchers in this effort is important to ensure that there will be sufficient expertise in the nuclear physics community and beyond to support the future need for cryogenic instrumentation. The junior researchers will also have the opportunity to get involved in hardware, simulation and analysis projects and learn valuable skills in several programming languages and in the analysis of large data sets. The studies of the Michigan group at PSI aim to reassess the proton charge radius and the discrepancies that remain by performing the first simultaneous measurement of elastic electron and muon scattering off the proton, which is afforded by a beam that contains positively and negatively charged electrons, muons and pions. This approach has never been attempted before by another research collaboration and carries high promise to resolve the proton radius puzzle. Due to their specific expertise in building and running cryogenic targets, the Michigan group will lead the unpolarized target effort at MUSE and support the polarized target effort at Fermilab. This program builds on the expertise the group has gained and is a natural extension of the group's work over the past years. It provides a balanced mix of hardware, simulation and analysis projects, which will benefit the postdoc, and it will allow the U-M group to play a key role in the MUSE experiment at PSI. Education and training of postdoctoral fellows, as well as outreach aimed at the general public is an important aspect of this research program, particularly its international component, as it will expose them to physicists from many different countries, fostering cultural exchange and giving them the opportunity to develop their communication and leadership skills.

Bifurcation and Stability in Rotating Fluids and Galactic Structures,"Many galaxies in the universe are elliptical in shape or have spiral arms. The density distribution of stars in these galaxies breaks the circular symmetry. However, the fundamental mechanism for symmetry breaking in galactic dynamics is not well understood mathematically. One does not know why a symmetry breaking density distribution of stars can persist, nor how they can emerge out of a circular distribution via instabilities of the dynamics. These questions were studied by astrophysicists via numerical simulations and analysis of toy models. The PI advances the knowledge on these problems by carrying out general mathematical analysis of the basic governing equations. On a related front, the principal investigator (PI) focuses on the more compact object of a rotating neutron star or a rotating binary star system. He studies these systems by constructing new solutions to fluid models coupled with Einstein’s general theory of relativity. During the course of these investigations, the PI actively creates questions and mini projects accessible to graduate students at the University of Oklahoma (OU). He also develops lecture series, topics courses, and student seminar talks at OU to disseminate new ideas as well as background knowledge related to the project and mathematical astrophysics in general. The PI works with the OU Association for Women in Mathematics, OU Math Day, Norman Math Circle and other local organizations to further the impact of the project, and to generate interest for math and science in the next generation of students in the Norman and southern Oklahoma area. The current project aims at studying the existence and stability of steady state solutions to various models of rotating stars and galaxies. These include the Euler-Poisson and Vlasov-Poisson equations, which are fluid and kinetic models of a self-gravitating gas under Newtonian gravity, and the Euler-Einstein equations, which is a fluid model of rotating stars in general relativity. In order to provide descriptions for disc galaxies, the PI studies 2D solutions to the Newtonian models. In comparison with the well-studied 3D solutions, the 2D equations involve non-local operators and their theory is completely missing in the mathematical literature. The PI uses calculus of variations and continuation methods to construct steady 2D solutions, and study their stability using the theory of separable Hamiltonian PDEs as well as equivalent higher order scalar equations. In the process, the emphasis is placed on finding solutions that break axisymmetry, providing models of elliptical and spiral galaxies. This is another feature that is completely lacking in the available mathematical literature. In a different direction, the PI constructs steady solutions of the Euler-Einstein equations that model rotating neutron stars. Previous results treat the solutions as a small perturbation of a non-rotating Newtonian star, and is only valid in the near Newtonian limit of the Einstein equations. The PI solves the full relativistic problem by perturbing a non-rotating relativistic star. Moreover, the PI constructs solutions modeling binary star systems to both the Newtonian and relativistic equations. He aims at creating initial data sets satisfying the constraint equations, which provides basis for future development of binary stars in general relativity.

Computational studies of new Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions,"The magnetic phases that can be formed in chiral magnets has been of increasing interest due to the unique and exciting physics and potential applications these materials have. The chiral magnetism in these materials is created by the competition of energy terms in the Hamiltonian, namely exchange and the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya Interaction (DMI). This DMI is created from the asymmetric environment of interacting magnetic spins and is thus connected with non-centrosymmetric crystallographic point groups. As these non-centrosymmetric point groups have different symmetries the form of the DMI equation changes from one to the next. However, only a small number of DMI point groups have been studied so far. 

This project will investigate the physics of the yet unexplored DMI terms computationally. These terms will be integrated into micromagnetic calculators and will be made open-source to enable the magnetism community to use it for research outside of this project. The multidimensional parameter space of these new DMI terms will be systematically investigated for new magnetic structures using machine learning techniques. Novel magnetic structures discovered will have their stability, equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics studied to gain new physics insights. This will lead to exciting new physical phenomena being discovered which may have the potential for applications in spintronics.",188182,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Entanglement restoral with fast photonic circuits,"The world is currently on the verge of a new technological revolution, rooted on the possibility of harnessing unique properties of quantum mechanics such as entanglement to implement novel paradigms for computation. Semiconductor quantum dots are excellent candidates to become the sources at the heart of future photonic quantum technologies due to their capability of emitting single and even entangled photons. However, the presence of a fine structure splitting (FSS) between the excitonic levels significantly degrades the quality of the entangled emission from quantum dots and causes the latter to emit random entangled states instead of always the same Bell’s one: this pervasive problem has proved to be a major hindrance and prompted significant efforts to devise mitigation strategies.
All the approaches implemented so far assume that, in order to prevent the degradation of entangled photon emission, its prime cause, the fine structure splitting of the source, should be removed. Several approaches have yielded excellent results in this sense, but at the cost of unwanted side-effects or increases in fabrication complexity and introduction of additional challenges for photonic integration.
I propose to implement a complete paradigm shift in the search for a solution to this problem and show that entanglement restoral can be achieved after the emission of the photons from the source: as the latter emits a statistical mixture of entangled states when an FSS is present, and entanglement is not destroyed on a fundamental level, entanglement restoral can in principle be achieved by applying a sequence of logic gates that transforms any component of the ensemble to the same Bell state.
I propose to implement this approach and show its superiority for integrated quantum photonics by developing the world’s first fast photonic circuit in a Lithium Niobate platform designed to manipulate polarization-entangled photons, and fully integrate a quantum dot on the photonic chip.",188182,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
General Eigenstate Thermalization in Quantum Circuits,"Understanding the dynamics of typical many-body quantum systems and the emergence of their universal thermodynamic description is both challenging and of paramount importance in various areas of physics, including condensed-matter and quantum-information theory, as well as statistical and high-energy physics. Combining methods of those fields into novel interdisciplinary approaches, GETQuantum - General Eigenstate Thermalization in Quantum Circuits - aims for establishing a General Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (General ETH) and its connection to the mathematical field of Free Probability through the lens of Multi-Point Correlation Functions. The project focuses on Local Quantum Circuits, which, while native to quantum computing applications, have emerged as minimal models for many-body quantum dynamics and have let to unique analytical insights in recent years. Within this setting, the first scientific objective of this project is to identify universal properties of Multi-Point Correlation Functions and their dynamics. This includes deriving exact results obtained via novel analytical tools as well as by numerical investigations based on new efficient numerical algorithms. The second objective of GETQuantum is to establish the recently introduced General ETH, formulated in the language of Free Probability, and its consequences in interacting many-body quantum systems, modeled by Local Quantum Circuits, beyond the current paradigm of standard ETH. It aims at pinpointing correlations between matrix elements of physical observables and at confirming predictions of Free Probability by relating Free Cumulants, a central concept of Free Probability, with the dynamics of Multi-Point Correlation Functions. Hence, General ETH provides an intricate link between dynamical and statistical properties of many-body quantum systems.

Exploration of Back-End-Of-Line Compatible Te-Based P-Type Transistors With 2D Material Van Der Waals Contacts for Monolithic 3D Integration,"The performance enhancement of integrated circuits relying on the downscaling of transistor dimensions following Moore’s law is becoming more and more challenging as silicon is reaching its physical limit. Thus, monolithic 3D integration has been considered as a powerful method to improve system performance further. 
This requires that transistors be stacked on top of each other at back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible temperatures to avoid degradation of underlying devices. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates for such BEOL transistors but most advancements in terms of device performance and reliable BEOL integration concern n-type devices, while p-type is still lagging behind. Hence, better p-type BEOL transistors are highly sought after to enable complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. One of several challenges for p-type devices is contact resistance because wide band gap 2D semiconductors typically have large Schottky barriers between the metal contact and their valence band. Tellurium (Te) and its compounds have recently been identified as promising candidates for BEOL p-type 2D transistors, which offer decent access to their valence bands, integration at BEOL-compatible temperatures, and good material prospects for device performance. However, research on such devices is still in its infancy, and drive current, stability (passivation), and contact resistance still need improvements. Thus, in this work, we propose to advance the research in Te-based p-type devices. In particular, we will experimentally explore the potential of 2D material van der Waals contacts. Furthermore, we will evaluate the CMOS logic circuit performance coupling with its n-type counterpart and the prospects of our devices for monolithic 3D integration through simulation.",188182,2025,2027,European Commission,Germany,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
"Off-resonant parametric control over THz collective modes in correlated materials: Complex driving protocols, non-equilibrium correlated states and applications.","Currently, light induced states of matter focus the attention of many researchers in condensed matter physics. An important limitation at the moment is the lack of efficient technology that could be used to control material properties at THz frequencies. On the other hand, this regime is interesting, because many materials exhibit collective resonances in the THz regime. Some examples are the Higgs modes of superconducting and charge density wave phases, plasmons in two dimensional materials and magnons in antiferromagnets.
	This project addresses the problem of exciting and manipulating THz collective modes in correlated electronic systems. The idea is to use complex drives with a nontrivial spectral composition, or polarization properties. One example that will be investigated in this project are amplitude modulated signals. Here, a high frequency signal is modulated on the THz scale. Under special conditions, the modulation can couple to THz collective modes such as magnons and plasmons. The collective modes are then parametrically excited. An intriguing aspect of this scheme is that the driving is off-resonant, i.e. the driving consists of frequencies which are much higher (e.g. by a factor of a hundred) then the collective resonances. This can be useful to reduce noise and heating.
	During this project, we will study ways to off-resonantly excite low frequency collective modes through complex driving protocols. Our main focus will be on antiferromagnetic Mott insulators with a strong Hund coupling, and plasmons in two dimensional gapped Dirac materials. Upon establishing tailored driving protocols, we will study the non-equilibrium states to which the systems evolve under strong driving. Finally, applications, such as time varying spintronic and plasmonic media with unusual wave propagation properties, and means to create THz entangled magnons, which could be useful in quantum devices, will be considered.",188182,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany; United States,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Testing the horizon of black holes with gravitational waves,"Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a unique opportunity to test gravity in a regime inaccessible to traditional astronomical observations. One of the main predictions of general relativity (GR) is the existence of black holes (BHs) featuring a horizon beyond which nothing  — not even light — can escape. Observations of GWs from the remnants of binary BH coalescences have the potential to probe the physics at the horizon of BHs.
This prospect is of particular interest given some quantum-gravity theories and dark matter models that predict the presence of horizonless compact objects, known as exotic compact objects (ECOs). ECOs emit a different GW signal than BHs due to the absence of a horizon. Studying their imprints in the postmerger stage allows one to investigate the existence of horizons in compact remnants.
So far, the ground-based detectors LIGO and Virgo have detected GWs from the coalescence of binary BHs and neutron stars. Several tests on the properties of the remnants have been performed, setting constraints on generic deviations from general relativity. Current constraints can be converted into bounds on the location of the horizon by modelling the variations introduced by a generic class of ECOs. However, this aim has not been achieved given the open problems in modelling spinning ECOs, which I plan to tackle in this proposal.
This project will provide the first bounds on the location of the horizon with current GW observations. For this purpose, I will extend the current state-of-the-art in ECO modelling to spinning configurations and develop new data-analysis schemes relating the postmerger GW signal to the horizon properties. Finally, I will assess the prospects of detectability of BH horizons with next-generation detectors, such as the ground-based Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. The outcome of this project will provide novel tests of general relativity and shed light on quantum gravity.",188181,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany; Denmark; Portugal,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Dirac Photonic Metamaterial for Quantum Light Sources,"Technology in photonic quantum information processing and quantum computing is advancing rapidly, requiring more efficient and precise control of the generation of quantum states of light. Over the past decade, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as near-perfect photon sources with unprecedented photon emission rates compared to other technologies. However, two key factors, photon indistinguishability and extraction efficiency, are critical for practical applications such as multiphoton interferometric experiments, quantum computing and boson sampling. Achieving both high photon indistinguishability and extraction efficiency from any quantum light source is challenging due to inherent trade-offs between precise control of photon properties and efficient collection, as well as technical and material limitations. Various photonic structures (such as cavities and metamaterials) have been used to improve the extraction efficiency of the emitters, but they often introduce complexities that adversely affect photon indistinguishability. Imperfections such as etched surfaces around QDs can lead to unwanted effects like an unstable charge environment due to exposed crystal bonds and surface interactions, ultimately degrading photon indistinguishability. To address these issues and improve performance, a promising alternative approach is to integrate quantum dots with Dirac photonic metamaterials. Within these metamaterials, topological states can emerge as protected edge states, which are known to be resilient to disorder and imperfections. Furthermore, Dirac photonic metamaterials lead to enhanced light-matter interactions, allowing a dramatic increase in spontaneous emission and the manipulation of chiral photon modes.  The overall aim of this project is to combine quantum dots (InGaAs) with Dirac photonic metamaterials to achieve specific goals, including high photon indistinguishability, efficient photon extraction and tailored single-photon emission.",188181,2024,2026,European Commission,Germany,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Fundamental physical metrology with cold molecules (COMOMET),"Recently, academic research laboratories have developed advanced instrumentation to cool, manipulate and investigate molecules with extremely high precision, reaching parts in 1013 in some cases. This project aims to unlock the potentials of applying cold molecules in metrology, including the need for establishing frequency standards in the infrared (IR) spectrum, testing the fundamental laws of physics that underpin basic metrological principles, such as fundamental symmetries and variation of fundamental constants, and improved determination of fundamental constants, like the proton-toelectron and the deuteron-to-electron mass ratios, the Rydberg constant, and the proton and deuteron charge radii. In this project, fibre-optic connections built during previous EURAMET projects (e. g. EMRP JRP SIB02 NEAT-FT and EMPIR JRPs 15SIP04 TIMEFUNC, 17IND14 WRITE, 15SIB05 OFTEN and 18SIB06 TiFOON) will be used and further extended in terms of number of connections and km. Strong collaboration between NMIs and academic participants will lead to full exploitation of frequency references delivered via such fibre networks for molecular spectroscopy experiments.",187121,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Fusion of Compact Objects by Ray Tracing: Gravitational wave observables from the time evolution of the event horizon in extreme mass ratio mergers,"The project is a cutting-edge exploration of the dynamics of black hole collisions in general relativity and in modified gravity theories in an innovative way that makes the merging of black holes amenable to analytic treatment in the extreme-mass-ratio limit. 

By developing an approach based on ray tracing, the project assumes a pioneering stance, leveraging strong field tests of gravity to impart stringent constraints on modified gravity theories and learning more about black hole merging and matter collapse. The approach is complementary to other techniques currently employed, but in a regime that is not accessible to them.
Central to its timeliness is the burgeoning of gravitational wave astronomy, hastening the need for empirical validation. The forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) adds further urgency, promising novel insights into strong gravity within a decade.",186990,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Disk Instabilities in Highly Accreting Neutron Stars,"Astrophusical accretion disks are the main engine of most of high energy sources. Although they have been studies for decades, we still do not know their exact structure and their evolution with luminosity. A clear example is at high luminosity, for which our best theory predicts the presence in all sources of an instability which leads to the cyclic disruption/rebuilding of the disk. However, from the observational point of view, we have observed only a handful of accreting black holes. My recent work has demonstrated that these instabilities can take place also in accreting neutron stars, opening a new way to study this still poorly understood process. The main objective of DIANA is to exploit the recent advancements in highly accreting binary systems to set the most stringent constrains on the evolution structure of the accretion disk around neutron stars near the Eddington limit. To achieve this, I will combine for the first time X-ray polarization measurements with fast O-IR observations. The synergy of these two groundbreaking techniques will allow me to link directly the variations of the accretion flow structure to the relativistic ejections observed in these systems. Building on these observational results I will develop the first 1-D model for accretion instabilities around accreting neutron stars. This will represent a significant advance in our understanding of accretion disks, as will allow us to compare the appearance in BH and NS, providing key constrains on the origin of instabilities, and informing future 3D global simulations.",186990,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy; Poland,EU,Astronomical Sciences
PantaRhei: Gas flows in galaxies at Cosmic Noon,"""The formation and evolution of galaxies over cosmic time is driven by the continuous flow of gas in and out of systems, known as the """"baryon cycle."""" Current theoretical models suggest that feedback from star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) leads to gas outflows, regulating SF activity and enriching galaxy metal content. This ejective feedback is believed to be particularly powerful at z=1-2, during the peak of SF and AGN activity, known as Cosmic Noon. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of gas outflows at z=1-2 remains elusive. The PantaRhei project hosted at SNS seeks to fully characterise the galaxy baryon cycle at Cosmic Noon using a unique approach: (i) build the largest, high-resolution (R>3000), optical-restframe spectroscopic sample to date by combining new data from Subaru/FMOS (with exclusive access) and public archival data from VLT/KMOS, totallin ~7600 galaxies at z=1-2; (ii) gather direct evidence of ionised gas outflows through the study of emission lines, employing stacking and modelling techniques that I have pioneered during the past years; (iii) explore archaeological evidence of multiphase gas outflows using the footprints left in the chemical enrichment of gas and stars; and (iv) build mock optical-restframe spectra from zoom-in simulations using the theoretical prescriptions developed in the Host Institute. This approach will allow quantifying the impact of ionised gas outflows on the overall gas phase and determine whether these outflows are transient or enduring features in galaxy life cycles. Comparing these observational findings with predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation will provide crucial constraints for refining numerical models of SF and AGN feedback. This project promises to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and guide the planning of future surveys using instruments like JWST/NIRspec, VLT/MOONS, VISTA/4MOST, and ELT.""",186990,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
Stochastic Quantisation of Quantum Field Theories with Bosons and Fermions,"The mathematical foundation of Euclidean quantum field theory is a very active research area which has long been a central topic at the intersection of mathematical physics and probability theory. A general probabilistic framework to describe quantum fields called “stochastic quantisation” was proposed in the early 80's by the Nobel prize Giorgio Parisi, in collaboration with Yongshi Wu, and consists in the description of interacting quantum fields via the solution to some stochastic differential equation. The proposal aims at exploring novel directions in stochastic analysis that would allow for a fruitful continuation of the stochastic quantisation programme. Namely, the goal of the proposal is the extension of the known stochastic analytical methods in order to be able to construct quantum field theories for Fermi fields with large-scale singularities and quantum field theories for Fermi and scalar or gauge fields with small-scale singularities.",186990,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Quantum Physics
Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of spatially confined Hamiltonian systems.,"The EDYSC project aims to establish the foundations of a theory of out-of-equilibrium dynamics of spatially confined waves. To this end, the project will use the Wave Turbulence theory as a reference point, which is well-established for the description of out-of-equilibrium dynamics of weakly interacting (unconfined) waves. The research program will study how spatial confinement affects some of the most characteristic processes of Wave Turbulence such as propagation of chaos, thermalization, or energy transfer. It will be done by considering the influence of the discrete nature of resonances between waves (characteristic of spatially confined systems) on these processes. This study will characterize the principles that a theory of out-of-equilibrium spatially confined waves must follow. 

This proposal lies in the interphase between various areas of nonlinear physics and mathematics, having an interdisciplinary interest, both theoretically and experimentally. The effects of discrete resonances on the dynamics of confined systems have been observed in disparate topics, such as nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, gravity waves, general relativity, etc. These effects range from preventions of thermalization in light propagation in optical fibers to even the formation of arbitrarily small black holes. This wide range of applicability will be used to build synergies between the theoretical results of the project and experiments conducted by other groups.

The methodology uses a hybrid approach, based on numerical methods to get insight into the heart of the problems followed by its analytic description. To this end, the project will study a family of spatially confined systems with excellent analytic properties, the so-called highly resonant Hamiltonian systems. These systems have an outstanding structure of resonances which is huge, trivial to calculate, and the most organized. They are very convenient to study effects associated with discrete resonances.",186990,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy; France,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Collapse Points Quantum Mechanics,"""Quantum mechanics suffer from a fundamental internal inconsistency problem usually denoted as """"measurement problem"""". Many attempts have been made to solve it and, among them, spontaneous collapse theories are a promising way to do it. The main idea of such theories is to modify the fundamental dynamics described by quantum mechanics in such a way that this modification is practically negligible for microscopic systems but becomes more and more important with the mass of the system, providing a consistent way to describe every system ranging from microscopic to macroscopic. However, more than forty years after the introduction of spontaneous collapse models, we still do not have a satisfying relativistic spontaneous collapse model, i.e., a spontaneous collapse model compatible with special relativity in the same (or similar) way that quantum field theory makes standard quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity.

The two most important spontaneous collapse theories are the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) and the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) models. The former associates spontaneous collapse to particles while the latter introduces a fundamental noise disturbing the Schrödinger dynamics of fields. Our goal is to tackle the problem of developing a relativistic collapse theory on the basis of a new kind of spontaneous collapse model proposed by the applicant in a recent publication, where it is shown that this new model behaves consistently with the GRW and CSL models in the non-relativistic regime. In this new model, collapses are not a process inherent to the particles (or fields) but to spacetime itself. By treating spacetime in a relativistic way and exploiting the formalism of quantum field theory, we hope to develop a complete relativistic spontaneous collapse model. Any advancement in this sense, even partial ones, would represent a breakthrough in the field of """"Foundations of Physics"""".""",186990,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Quantum Physics
Bayesian tools for one-dimensional and three-dimensional hadron structure,"Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and Transverse-Momentum-Dependent PDFs (TMDs) encode our knowledge of the nucleon internal structure in terms of their elementary constituents, quarks and gluons. They are determined by means of global analyses of experimental data which require the development of suitable fitting methodologies. PDFs and TMDs represent an important input for precision studies at current and future accelerator facilities. The development of reliable fitting methodologies and their subsequent validation, in order to ensure the soundness of the corresponding results, is therefore a crucial problem in high-energy physics.
Thanks to the wealth of new data and fitting methodologies,  the accuracy to which PDFs and TMDs are known is rapidly improving. With the reduction of the uncertainties, an increasing tension has been observed among results from different groups, making the discussion around the determination of faithful uncertainties all the more urgent.
This research proposal,  Bayesian tools for one-dimensional and three-dimensional hadron structure (Bayhadron), develops a new methodology based on Bayesian inference and a set of statistical validation tools for PDF and TMD determination. The main goals of Bayhadron are two. 1) The development of a fully Bayesian methodology for PDF determination, providing a valid alternative to the methodologies based on parametric regression currently used within the community, and the release of a first PDF set based on it. 2) The application of validation tools developed within the PDF community to validate the fitting methodologies currently used for TMD determinations and their possible improvement by means of a Bayesian approach. Both goals of Bayhadron concur to a faithful determination of PDF and TMD errors, introducing a set of innovative statistical tools in the field and making the proposal particularly timely in light of current and future experimental and phenomenological efforts.",186989,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
Higher-spin symmetry and duality in (super)conformal field theory,"Conformal symmetry is the maximal spacetime symmetry in relativistic quantum field theory. Such a symmetry is also realised in condensed matter systems at second order phase transitions. Conformal field theories possessing higher-spin and/or duality symmetries, along with their supersymmetric extensions, have recently been the focus of enormous interest worldwide. This proposal puts forward a research program to explore the dynamics and quantum aspects of such theories. Using recent advances in group theoretic formalism to compute correlation functions, the project aims to develop novel, manifestly supersymmetric techniques used for comprehensive analysis of three-point functions for conserved higher-spin current multiplets in superconformal field theories in Minkowski and Anti-de Sitter backgrounds – both playing pivotal roles in deciphering celebrated dualities between quantum field and gravity theories. Another goal is to study, for the first time, the quantum properties of the recently discovered Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory. The latter is a unique non-linear extension of Maxwell's electrodynamics which is conformal and duality invariant. It has opened new avenues, all to be discovered, to study new classes of non-analytic conformal field theories. The project outcomes will advance our knowledge of scattering amplitudes and their relation to anomalies of superconformal field theories on curved backgrounds, while at the same time giving new insight into the field of non-linear electrodynamics. These results will be of major significance for a wide range of areas of modern mathematical and theoretical high-energy physics including string theory, gravity, cosmology and condensed matter.",186989,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics; Quantum Physics
thE impaCt Of coSmic raYS on the inTerstEllar Medium,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on the evolution of galaxies. The fact that the local CR energy density is comparable to the turbulent and magnetic energy densities implies that CRs can potentially influence the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM), regulating the level of star formation and driving large-scale outflows. Moreover, CRs have long been known to be a key source of heating and ionization in the dense ISM shielded from photoionizing radiation. Despite the considerable progress made in the field, there are still uncertainties in modeling the galactic-scale transport of CRs. As a result, the extent to which CRs impact ISM structure and evolution is yet unclear.

ECOSYSTEM will provide a significant step forward in the field, thanks to state-of-the-art MHD simulations modeling the transport of spectrally resolved CRs and their interplay with the ambient gas, with unprecedented physical detail. These simulations will employ a new algorithm in which the propagation of CRs depends on the properties of the multiphase ISM and CRs themselves. To cover multiple ISM scales and conditions, the project will combine simulations of kpc-sized portions of galactic disks representative of galactic environments typical of Milky Way-like galaxies with zoom-in simulations of individual molecular clouds, and will explore different galactic properties in terms of star formation rate, gas surface density, and gravitational potential.

This project will deliver a comprehensive theoretical investigation of how the distribution of CRs, in space and energy, vary with the dynamical, thermal, and magnetic properties of the gas. Three questions will be addressed thanks to ECOSYSTEM: 1) What is the impact of CRs within the ISM disk and for galactic wind driving? 2) How do the large-scale spatial and spectral distribution of CRs depend on galactic environment? 3) What sets the CR ionization rate in the dense ISM?",186989,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Astronomical Sciences
HIPFLAPP: High Precision Flavoured Particle Production at the Large Hadron Collider,"The project will develop and exploit theoretical calculations to study particle collisions that feature heavy flavours, namely the charm quark and beauty quark, at the Large Hadron Collider. Identifying heavy quarks is critical to pinpoint specific scattering processes and reject backgrounds, resulting in an unique opportunity to probe the structure of the proton, to improve our understanding of the Higgs mechanism and to possibly unveil the presence of new physics signals in the LHC data. On the theoretical side, the accuracy and the precision of phenomenological predictions must be increased to keep up with the progressively smaller uncertainty on experimental measurements, so that reliable comparisons with experimental data can be performed. More specifically, the project will focus on very accurate computations in quantum chromodynamics to better describe the production of flavoured particles across a wide kinematic range, so that no region of phase-space is left unexplored: these theory predictions will require a combination of both fixed-order and all-order perturbative calculations in the strong coupling constant. A public code with the implementation of the predictions for heavy hadron production at ultimate precision will be assembled, hence providing other researchers in theoretical physics and the experimental collaborations with a valuable tool in the LHC precision era.",186989,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Characterising Heterostructures and Integrated Methodologies for Electronic Real-time Analysis in 2D Materials,"The next wave of electronic quantum devices requires the development of solid-state systems showcasing distinct quantum properties. The ongoing intensive research has pinpointed promising quantum systems in 2D materials, particularly those derived from transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Their properties are typically investigated in two distinct and separate phases. Initially, electronic states and transitions between them are studied through optical spectroscopy. The material is then embedded in a device whose electrical response is characterised by using electron transport spectroscopy. This workflow, however, fails to capture events such as grain boundaries formation, defects, and carrier scattering sources that happen when the device is operating and are major factors for performance deterioration and energy wastage. As a result, the correlation between material structure modifications and quantum properties remains largely unexplored. This action seeks to bridge this gap by merging both techniques into a unified, real-time methodology. I will produce wafer-sized TMDs layers using a novel synthesis technique compatible with industry routines for large-scale manufacturing. I will then fabricate TMD-based field-effect transistors and monitor the optical response of the channel whilst charge carriers flow through it. This will provide a fundamental understanding of rapid ageing effects in nanoscale transistors. Ultimately, using this knowledge, I aim to fabricate energy-efficient logic gates with TMDs.",186989,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Revealing Electron phoNOn couplIng from RIXS,"The electron-phonon interaction is ubiquitous in many-particle physics and chemistry. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) determines countless physical properties and phenomena. Notably, it gives rise to conventional superconductivity and plays a key role in high-temperature superconductivity. The main goal of RENOIR is to accurately determine the EPC strength in materials that are relevant for technological applications, providing crucial insights into the behaviour of excitons and phonon-driven phenomena. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy holds the promise to access phonon excitations with a remarkable high-resolution, thanks to the significant technical advancements achieved in recent years, providing momentum dependence and bulk sensitivity. However, the interpretation of measured signatures remains challenging since different excitations are coupled through interactions. Indeed, although RIXS is used to measure EPC, it primarily reveals exciton-phonon coupling, due to the interaction with a core hole. So far, theoretical approaches mainly rely on oversimplified models that use adjustable parameters to fit experimental results, limiting their applicability. RENOIR aims to convert this challenge into the opportunity to  realise the great potential of RIXS to determine EPC in quantum materials. RENOIR will develop a novel parameter-free methodology to calculate RIXS spectra, combining accurate and reliable approaches, such as the Bethe-Salpeter Equation within Green’s functions theory for excitons, and Density Functional Perturbation Theory for phonons. As a primary application, RENOIR will focus on high-temperature superconducting materials and heterostructures, celebrated for their transformative power in electronics and energy applications. Moreover, the resulting software will be made freely available to a very wide community, opening the way for understanding and predicting RIXS measurements of EPC in many other materials.",186989,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy,EU,Quantum Physics
POlarised Electroweak Bosons at the LHC with Improved Theoretical Accuracy,"Extracting the polarisation of electroweak (EW) bosons from Large-Hadron-Collider (LHC) data represents a crucial step towards a deep understanding of the electroweak-symmetry-breaking (EWSB) mechanism realised in nature. Therefore, an accurate and realistic theoretical modelling is needed for polarised-boson production and decay in relevant LHC processes. In order to improve the current theoretical accuracy for polarised-bosons processes and to enable direct comparisons with experimental data, this research aims at the inclusion of higher-order corrections in the strong and EW couplings through a matching of fixed-order predictions to parton-shower programs. This will be carried out within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, as well as in the presence of beyond-the-SM effects, allowing for broad phenomenological investigations of the EWSB and fostering the development of polarisation taggers (also using modern machine-learning techniques) that will be beneficial for upcoming LHC analyses.",186989,2025,2027,European Commission,Italy,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Ambrosio-Tortorelli approach to topological singularities,"The exploration of topological singularities is a fascinating task of absolute relevance both from the theoretical and applied point of view.
 For example, in physics and materials science they arise from the study of mathematical models for vortices in superconductors, grain boundaries in polycrystals, fractures in solids,  and defects in crystals such as disclinations or dislocations. Furthermore, topological singularities play an important role in the study of more geometric problems such as the Plateau problem and the theory of minimal surfaces. 

The goal of TopSing is to study some physical/mechanical problems where singularities appear, through a theoretical approach that opens promising directions also for other, apparently unrelated, situations like the non-parametric Plateau problem in higher codimension. 
More specifically, we draw our attention to codimension-two singularities and consider two-dimensional models for fields having point singularities  which are relevant in the study of two main problems: 

1) Screw Dislocations in crystals and their relation with vortices in superconductors; 

2) The non-parametric Plateau problem in codimension-two.

The main novelty consists in developing a unified approach, inspired by the classical model by Ambrosio and Tortorelli (AT), that allows to study topological singularities in both contexts listed above. Furthermore this will provide a model which is easier to handle numerically and thus interesting from the point of view of applications.
The project is organised into four main objectives whose common thread is the asymptotic analysis of elliptic functionals á la AT for maps taking values on the unit circle.   To our best knowledge there are no similar results in the literature. This is due to the non trivial task of constructing a recovery sequence that takes values on the circle, which we aim at achieving by relying on degree theory and by using techniques developed to study the relaxed area.",186989,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy; United States,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
Moiré Patterns in Twisted Heterostructures of Ultrathin Metal Halide Perovskite Nanosheets,"The moiré patterns in the twisted heterostructures of the layered semiconductors such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, h-BN, etc. have led to the emergence of novel exciting properties such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, enhanced charge transfer at the interface of heterostructures, etc. Despite being a highly desirable phenomenon in the vertical heterostructures of the layered materials, moiré patterns are yet to be explored in the metal halide perovskites. The 2D layered and 3D metal halide perovskites have become one of the most explored classes of semiconductor materials owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. The TWISTPVSK project aims to generate twisted heterostructures using ultrathin nanosheets of 2D layered perovskites and ultrathin nanosheets of 3D perovskites. The primary goal is to leverage the enhanced optoelectronic properties resulting from moiré patterns for photodetection applications and establish the role of moiré patterns in the generation of new properties in 2D and 3D metal halide perovskites. The key objectives of this proposal are to: i) synthesize twisted heterostructures of ultrathin nanosheets of 2D layered perovskites, study the moiré exciton dynamics using ultrafast spectroscopy, and explore the effect of twisting angle on photodetection efficiency; ii) chemically convert ultrathin 2D layered perovskites into 3D MA-based perovskite nanosheets, create twisted heterostructures of 3D perovskites, investigate moire exciton dynamics, and fabricate photodetectors based on these heterostructures. TWISTPVSK is at the crossroads of chemistry, physics, and engineering; therefore, it will attract significant attention from different disciplines, offer fresh insights into the behavior of metal halide perovskites, and contribute to the development of next generation technologies.",186989,2024,2026,European Commission,Italy,EU,Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Condensed Matter Physics
Recovering plasma-facing components temperatures in fusion devices from IR camera measurements,"Infrared (IR) cameras are key diagnostics to monitor and control plasma-facing components (PFCs) in fusion devices. Nevertheless, the use of all-metallic PFCs with low and variable emissivity (ε ~ 0.1-0.5) makes it difficult to obtain a correct surface temperature measurement. The radiance collected by the IR camera includes both the thermal radiation emitted by the target and parasitic radiation coming from the target's surroundings. Furthermore, target emissivity changes with the surface temperature and roughness. This causes significant errors in the surface temperature measurement that we need to address for achieving high power and safe plasma operation. Inaccurate interpretation of IR temperature measurement could endanger machine safety (temperature underestimation) or on the contrary, lead to unnecessary pulse interruptions that reduce the overall performance of the machine (temperature overestimation). The current approach is to convert the radiance collected by each pixel in an apparent using a physical relationship between emitted radiance and temperature (Planck’s law). Because a portion of the collected radiance is due to reflection on the target, a systematic error is made. This method is unable to recover the portion of reflected radiance and to deduce the correct temperature of the target using only the emitted radiance. The proposed technique in this project is to use a digital twin of the machine and to make in it assumptions on the temperatures of the different elements of the machine in order to simulate the images that would be measured under these supposed conditions. By comparing to the real image measured by the camera and using optimization techniques, the assumptions on the parameters can be updated until the simulated and measured images are close enough. It is then deduced that the assumptions made on the parameters of the digital twin are correct and that they correspond to the real temperatures in the machine.",185530,2024,2026,European Commission,Slovenia; France,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
RUI: Studies of Heavy Quarkonium Spectroscopy with Belle and Belle II,"The spectroscopy of Heavy Quarkonium is generally regarded as an excellent laboratory for understanding Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum theory of strong interactions. A renaissance of quarkonium spectroscopy came with experiments including CLEO, CLEO-c, Belle and Belle II, with which the PI of this program has been engaged for twenty-five years. The Belle and Belle II Experiments at KEK in Japan have collected the world's largest data samples at the bottomonium resonances, the so-called Upsilon resonances. These samples have allowed experimenters to acquire large statistics for observing the decays of bottomonium, open bottom, and open charm mesons, and thereby study important questions of heavy flavor physics and of rare phenomena in these decays, including potentially New Physics. The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and bottomonium-like mesons like the exotic four-quark Zb states, with a focus on resonant states that probe the limits of our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and of states whose quark content cannot be either three quarks or a quark and antiquark. The Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking part in every aspect of Belle and Belle II data analysis, and to support the operation of the upgraded experiment, Belle II. The broader impacts of the program focus on bringing the exciting world of elementary particle physics and scientific research to audiences including students and teachers both in the rural northeast quarter of Iowa, but also surrounding areas in the region including western Wisconsin and southern Minnesota through classroom visits, student STEM fair programs, and other activities. Outreach efforts include bringing International Master Classes for high school and middle school students in the region, through STEM-related classes in the Dorian Music camps which reach over 600 students each summer at Luther College, and go considerably beyond, as the PI is co-chair of the Belle II Outreach group which oversees social media and outreach to teachers and students on behalf of the Collaboration.

Cosmology and Fundamental Physics,"This award funds the research activities of a postdoc at Tufts University who will be working under the direction of Professors Mark Hertzberg and Ken Olum. Our universe may contain a network of cosmic strings, microscopically thin objects of astronomical length that may arise from the breaking of symmetries associated with the fundamental laws of elementary particle physics. In this project, the PIs will develop a new simulation of axion strings. Axions are a leading candidate for the mysterious dark matter that makes up most of the matter of the universe, but in many scenarios the connection between the axion properties and the resulting dark matter depends on the dynamics associated with a cosmological epoch of axion strings. In another project, the PIs will compare and contrast the success of various theoretical models of the Big Bang. To do this, they intend to perform a mix of semi-analytical work and numerical simulations. Research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and an improved understanding of the early universe. The project is also intended to have broader impacts through the training of a postdoctoral researcher, and the results of this project will be broadly disseminated through journal publications and made available to the public on the World Wide Web. More technically, the computational code developed at the Tufts Institute of Cosmology will be used to study gravitational effects on strings and will be extended to simulate axion strings as Nambu strings coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field. Also, the PIs intend to examine the correspondence between simulations of field theory on a lattice and simulations of Nambu (infinitely thin) strings. This will lead to a more accurate computation of axion dark matter properties, and thereby help to determine whether axions are the source of the observed dark matter. Furthermore, the work on evolving inhomogeneous initial states will involve detailed numerical scalar field and gravitational simulations/calculations, with initial conditions drawn from a range of probability distributions.

Quantum Hall Fractions and Frames,"This project continues an interdisciplinary endeavor in physics, mathematics, and engineering to deepen our understanding of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) - a phenomenon in which conductance of an electron gas at low temperatures and strong magnetic fields exhibits a unique, staircase-like behavior. The precision of this effect is so remarkable (accurate to one part in a billion) that it underpins the modern metrological definitions of the kilogram and the ampere. The project aims to bridge a crucial gap in the current understanding of the QHE, specifically the lack of microscopic mathematical theory explaining 'anyons' in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Developing such a theory could advance efforts to construct and operate topological quantum computers. Furthermore, the investigator commits to training a new generation of scientists by involving graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in quantum information and engineering, promoting educational advancement and diversity in STEM fields. Through these efforts, the project not only advances scientific knowledge but also helps maintain a skilled workforce. The project focuses on the theory of integer and fractional QHE. While our understanding of integer QHE is quite robust, there remain several profound mathematical problems that have yet to be answered. Conversely, our comprehension of fractional QHE is limited, and there is no microscopic theory of anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect - such a theory is highly relevant for applications in topological quantum computation. This project aims to advance our understanding of the fractional case and address open problems in the integer case. The project comprises two parts: (A) fractions in QHE and (B) frustration-free models of QHE. A significant problem in the theory of fractional QHE is explaining which fractions are admissible. Notably, a fractional Hall conductance of one half is not experimentally observed (is not admissible), while one third is. Numerous competing theories attempt to explain admissible fractions, but even within the realm of theoretical physics, there is no definitive answer to this problem. At a mathematical level of rigor, nothing is known. The investigator will study a new, symmetry-based explanation and further aims to make this explanation mathematically rigorous. The idea is to relate admissible fractions to symmetry constraints on a modular tensor category that describes anyonic excitations of the system. All exactly solvable models of anyons are frustration-free; however, none of these models describe the QHE. In (B), the goal is to demonstrate that this is not a coincidence and that all frustration-free models have zero Hall conductance. The investigator aims to establish a connection to the theory of frames and use this connection to prove the conjecture. The investigator will employ a diverse combination of mentoring activities to guide mentees' individual research processes and provide them with opportunities to participate in more advanced work. The project also includes sub-projects for undergraduate students aimed at filling a gap in research experience opportunities for undergraduate students at UC Davis.

Geometry and Integrability of Random Processes,"Two major goals of probability theory are to address the question of how large complex systems work and to identify the geometry of their evolution. Probabilistic models are widespread in fields like biology, statistical physics, quantum mechanics, and machine learning. Examples include models of cancer growth, spread of disease in population, governing principles of subatomic particles, black holes, neural networks, etc. The purpose of this project is to understand the geometry and intrinsic properties of a string of models that are representatives of these examples. The project aims to resolve open questions in those fields based on tools that the investigator has developed. Domino tilings, random matrices, and stochastic six vertex models are areas of intense interest in the field of statistical physics, while Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) and theory of optimal transport have gained immense attention in the fields of quantum mechanics and machine learning. This project revolves around questions in those areas and aims to acquire new insights about their geometry and integrability. In particular, this project plans to: (1) find laws of iterated logarithms and fractal dimension of models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class including the KPZ fixed point, edge spectrum of random matrices, and domino tilings; (2) build a unified framework for studying the moment formulas of interacting particle systems and vertex models including the stochastic six vertex model; (3) rigorously prove modular transformation properties of conformal blocks of LCFT and partition functions from gauge theory; and (4) study the convergence of entropically regularized optimal transport to optimal transport when the regularization vanishes. By intermingling ideas from various fields including geometry of polymers, representation theory, Riemann-Hilbert techniques, quantum groups, and convex geometry, the investigator aims to resolve questions that were hard to tackle with other methods.

RADIOFOREGROUNDSPLUS,"One of the main challenges in Cosmology is the detection of the primordial B-mode of CMB polarization, which would constitute a confirmation of the inflationary period of the Universe. However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions. RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources. It will also
provide an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This goal can only be achieved by combining the ESA’s Planck satellite maps (30-857GHz) with the unique low frequency experiments considered in this proposal: QUIJOTE (10-40 GHz), C-BASS (5 GHz) and S-PASS (2.3 GHz), by counting within the consortium with experts on the previous data sets (including the teams responsible for QUIJOTE and C-BASS) and by using the most advanced analysis techniques. The combination of these datasets will provide highlevel data products, that will range from more complete radio catalogues, including fainter sources and additional frequency coverage, to new component separated maps in wider regions of the sky. These new data products and models will be made available to the scientific community through widely-used platforms, increasing the scientific return and the impact of the project. We will also provide forecasts
of the impact of radio foregrounds on the detectability of the B-mode of polarization for future CMB experiments. The resulting analyseswill play a key role in preparing and supporting future international CMB missions as LiteBIRD or ground-based efforts as CMB-S4.",182056,2024,2026,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
New Perspectives in Combinatorics for Lie Algebra Representations and Schubert Calculus,"This project uses combinatorial models to solve problems and perform computations in algebra (more specifically, representation theory), as well as geometry and topology of flag manifolds; new connections between these areas are also revealed in this process. Combinatorics studies discrete structures (such as permutations and graphs), which are well suited for encoding complex mathematical objects. Representation theory is a fundamental tool for studying symmetry, by realizing the elements of abstract groups/algebras as linear transformations of some vector spaces. The PI studies representations of Lie algebras and quantum groups, which have many applications to physics, such as calculating the probability of a particle system being in a given state at a particular time. In geometry, the PI focuses on modern Schubert calculus on flag manifolds. This area has its origins in enumerative geometry (e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions), and is currently related to modern areas such as quantum cohomology/K-theory and elliptic cohomology. This project includes several research topics for graduate and undergraduate students. In representation theory, the PI will work on new applications and problems involving crystals, which are colored directed graphs encoding representations of quantum algebras when the quantum parameter goes to 0. One such problem is concerned with a refinement of the so-called atomic decomposition of crystals, due to the PI and C. Lecouvey; this refinement is related to the pre-canonical bases of Hecke algebras, recently defined by N. Libedinsky, L. Patimo, and D. Plaza, which interpolate between the standard basis and the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis. The PI will also extend and find new applications of his quantum alcove model, as a uniform combinatorial model for (tensor products of) Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, in all affine types. In modern Schubert calculus, the PI has two main projects. The first one involves an application of the Chevalley multiplication formula in the quantum K-theory of flag manifolds, recently proved by the PI, S. Naito, and D. Sagaki. The second one is concerned with the equivariant elliptic cohomology of flag manifolds, and more precisely with the combinatorics of the elliptic classes constructed by R. Rimányi and A. Weber.

Research on Gravitational Waves and Compact Binaries,"This award will support scientific research on the orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission of black hole binary systems. Over one hundred observations by LIGO and Virgo of merging stellar mass black holes and neutron stars in the last nine years have opened up the era of gravitational wave astronomy. These events reveal new astrophysics, including confirming the site of heavy-element formation and discovering a new class of intermediate-mass black holes, and provide novel ways to test relativistic gravity theory. The breakthrough also motivates the development of the LISA space-based detector and raises prospects of eventual gravitational-wave observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). EMRIs involve a stellar-mass black hole (or neutron star or white dwarf) spiraling into supermassive black holes, known to exist in the center of virtually all large galaxies. Immersed in dense star clusters, these supermassive black holes will frequently capture compact stars into highly eccentric and inclined orbits. As these compact stars orbit, they radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the compact object to eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole (or tidally disrupted in the case of white dwarfs). The gravitational radiation will be observable with LISA. The theoretical work funded by this award will provide improved predictions of the expected signals from highly eccentric or inclined-precessing merging black hole binaries. Along the way, the work also contributes to the development of young scientists trained in high-performance computing and advanced mathematical methods, many of whom go on to strengthen the U.S. technical human resource base. The U.S. is a leader in gravitational-wave astronomy and these theoretical activities support future extensions of such observations. Future detection of gravitational waves from EMRIs will provide unique strong-field tests of relativistic gravity theory and probe the nature of black holes, while also uncovering the astrophysical properties of the dense central regions of galaxies and their cosmic history. To pursue this effort, new techniques in black hole perturbation theory and gravitational self-force methods will be developed, along with writing associated advanced computer codes. Symbolic mathematical calculations of black hole perturbation theory and the gravitational self-force will be made of Kerr (spinning) EMRIs to high order in the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion, for systems with both eccentric orbits and inclined, precessing orbits. The high post-Newtonian (PN) order perturbation and self-force findings support and reinforce broader efforts to advance arbitrary-mass-ratio PN theory and may provide calibrations of effective-one-body and surrogate models of merging binaries. These efforts to model Kerr EMRIs draw upon the lengthy experience of the PI's group over more than a decade in studying Schwarzschild EMRIs. Generated gravitational wave flux and self-force data will be incorporated in adiabatic and post-adiabatic inspiral calculations to provide accurate waveforms for much of an EMRI's evolution. A major part of this work will be conducted in collaboration with former students and colleagues at University College Dublin. Results and some computer codes will be made available in online repositories.

"Stars, Black Holes, and Disks: Dense Matter Phenomena in 2D Numerical Relativity","The merger of two neutron stars, or a neutron star with a black hole, involves extremes of all the fundamental forces: strong gravity, nuclear matter denser than atomic nuclei, incredibly strong magnetic fields, and huge energies released in the form of radiation of neutrinos and gravitational waves. Such systems give off gravitational waves as the neutron star and its companion spiral together and electromagnetic waves (visible light, infrared, gamma rays, etc) after the merger. Probing the extreme physics involved requires comparing observations with predictions from models. Modeling these events requires computer simulations including general relativity, turbulent magnetized fluid, and radiation. However, the post-merger evolution (which produces important electromagnetic signals and outflows of gas) lasts seconds, while most numerical simulations last less than a tenth of this time and so miss most of it. This project will probe these later times with numerical relativity, following the story of the merger through to completion, when nothing but a stable, quiescent black hole or neutron star remains. The key to evolving to late times is to treat the fluid properties as a combination of average, large-scale components and complicated mulit-scale turbulence. One can take advantage of a rough symmetry in the former about a rotation axis to do less computationally demanding (2D) simulations, so long as the effect of the turbulence on the average flows and magnetic fields are properly incorporated. Part of this project will be to improve models of these effects of turbulence. Another part will be to determine how the properties of matter and spacetime immediately after merger affect the subsequent output of radiation and gas. The PI will train students in STEM areas. The PI proposes to undertake long-time (multi-second) studies of these strong-gravity, dense-matter systems using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), which includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, neutrino transport, and a turbulence/dynamo model to capture previously omitted qualitative effects. Long-time 2D simulations will extend existing compact binary merger simulations for multiple seconds, yielding accurate predictions about outflows from disk and remnant, delayed remnant collapse, magnetic field evolution, and GRB energetics. The 2D axisymmetric evolution techniques will be imported into the numerical relativity code SpECTRE.

Advancing Faraday Isolators and Optical Modeling for Future Gravitational-Wave Detectors,"NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) confirmed Einstein’s 100-year-old prediction with the first detection of gravitational waves from two merging black holes. It set the stage for gravitational-wave astronomy as a powerful science tool for observing the invisible side of the universe in new unprecedented ways. Many other detections followed at an accelerating rate - from violent black-hole mergers to neutron star collisions, and detections revealing unexpected objects of uncertain nature. Technological upgrades of the instruments continue to improve detection sensitivity, helping shed more light on our understanding of the dense nature of the universe, the formation of black holes throughout cosmic time, or that of the universe. The Voyager technologies aim to reduce the quantum noise by cryogenically cooling the mirrors to lower thermal fluctuations. Cosmic Explorer is proposing much larger scale facilities (40 km long) with unique features and technologies that would improve the sensitivity by one order of magnitude. Faraday isolators are key devices that help prevent scatter light from resonating inside the interferometer, and their performance is essential in determining the gravitational-wave detector’s sensitivity. Also, planning and designing these uncommon large-scale facilities requires well-developed optical design tools and reliable optical models. The projects supported by this award address research to advance the development of low-loss Faraday isolators for future upgrades and the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, and for developing optical design models for the Cosmic Explorer optical layout, and optimizations for future LIGO upgrades. These projects will continue to offer research opportunities to undergraduate students at Montclair State University, who will gain valuable practical skills beneficial for future professions in industry or academia and inspire young scientists to consider careers in gravitational-wave astrophysics. The research work supported by this award has two components: First, an experimental component that aims at advancing the development of Faraday isolators to satisfy stringent low-loss and high-performance requirements for the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors. Particularly, losses in these components are widely recognized as limiting factors in the effectiveness of squeezing, and therefore improving the losses has immediate consequences on the detection sensitivity. In high-power areas such as the input optics, laser absorption in the magneto-optical elements makes these isolators susceptible to thermal effects due to the temperature dependence of their optical parameters. Research will be carried out at two wavelengths of interest – 1 um and 2 um. The experimental component also researches new promising low-absorption magneto-optical materials and their thermo-optic properties and includes broadband and cryogenic studies of these materials. The second component addresses 3-dimensional modeling of optical layouts in Cosmic Explorer and post A+, positioning of optical components, optimizing interfacing with other systems, and placement of baffles for minimizing the effects of scattering.

Local Geometric Langlands Correspondence and Representation Theory,"Representation theory studies the realization of groups as linear symmetries. There are two typical stages: 1) finding the general structure of representations of a given group (e.g., classifying irreducible representations), and 2) applying this to representations of particular interest (e.g., functions on a homogeneous space). This project aims to study higher representation theory, which studies the realization of groups as categorical symmetries. The emphasis of the proposal focuses on loop groups, where the theory remarkably mirrors classical harmonic analysis for p-adic groups. In particular, one finds Langlands-style decompositions here. This project focuses on understanding some key categories of interest in this framework. The investigator will study 3d mirror symmetry conjectures, representations of affine Lie algebras, and moduli spaces of bundles arising in the global geometric Langlands program. This project provides training opportunities for graduate students. In more detail, 3d mirror symmetry, representations of (reductive) affine Lie algebras, and the geometric Langlands program are the three primary ways actions of loop groups of reductive groups on categories arise. A large class of 3d mirror symmetry conjectures concerns the categorical Plancherel formula for loop group actions on categories of sheaves on loop spaces of particular varieties with group actions. The PI will establish first cases of 3d mirror symmetry and apply the results to give coherent descriptions of some categories of primary interest in geometric representation theory. Representations of Lie algebras concern the action of a group on its category of Lie algebra representations. The PI will extend previous work on critical level localization theory and develop a substitute for Soergel modules that will apply to poorly understood categories in the local geometric Langlands program. The applications to global geometric Langlands concern actions of loop groups of reductive groups on moduli spaces of a global nature, namely bundles with a level structure. The PI will extend the Satake theorem and apply the result to study Eisenstein series in the global geometric Langlands program.

Heterojunctions of Topological Insulator and Metal organic frameworks for THz detection applications,"Today, x-ray detection techniques are widely used in the homeland security, such as airport surveillance and custom activities, and in the medical diagnostics. However, x-rays are ionizing, can provoke cancer like diseases and, moreover, they are unable to detect fabric, plastic and concealed hazardous materials. The terahertz (THz) technology has a potential to solve these problems; however, mainly due to the low photon energy of THz waves, it is still difficult to accomplish high-speed and sensitive room temperature THz detection.

The proposed work aims to advance the THz detection technology by exploring exciting opto-electronic properties of topological insulators (TIs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and their interfaces. I will focus the research on the design and fabrication of heterojunctions consisting of TI thin films and semiconducting two-dimensional MOFs and on the optimization of their electronic properties and interaction strength with THz radiation. To address the enhancement of light-matter interaction in these novel devices I will vary the chemical composition of MOF layers, thus enabling the control of their crystalline order and of the coupling between organic and inorganic components. TIs surface properties will then enhance the charge carrier transport at the interface due to topological protection against the carrier scattering. These ingredients will allow tuning and optimization of the photocurrent generation upon absorption of THz photons, i.e. of the photodetection process.

The project will answer questions of the physical mechanisms of charge carrier transport in MOFs and at TI-MOF interfaces and of the key parameters for an enhancement of optoelectronic properties in Ti-MOF heterojunctions.",179989,2024,2026,European Commission,Czechia,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
Biomass-derived Sustainable Fuels by cascade Condensation and hydrodeoxygenation on single atom catalysts,"Lignocellulose is the largest renewable carbon source that does not compete with food, or land and can be catalytically converted into fuels. Accessing such high-value chemicals and biofuels is challenging due to the high strength of C-O and C-H bonds, requiring high-energy or multi-reaction steps. Thus, the strategic frontier of the Bio2SAF project aims to design a novel multifunctional single-atom catalyst utilizing densely and selectively functionalized graphene for sustainable fuels by cascade condensation and hydrodeoxygenation on non-noble metal heterogeneous catalysts. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) may effectively perform HDO due to the selective adsorption of reactants on highly exposed active sites due to the lower density of state (DOS) near the Fermi level than the bulk catalysts. Bio2SAF develops in three pillars:  development of tandem Oxophilic single atom super doped graphene: SD-G-SACs-I (M1: Ti, Mo, W, Nb, Zr for acidic functions & Mg, Ca for basic catalysis) for condensation.  This design aims at the efficient production of longer condensed species from the bio-derived components to cyclic and non-cyclic alkanes in the range of C9-C16 at high selectivity. The second pillar aims at the development of tandem non-noble metal single atom super doped graphene: SD-G-SACs-MII (M2: Ni, Cu, Co, Fe etc.) for hydrodeoxygenation of aldol condensation products. The third pillar focuses on development of graphene derivatives structurally and chemically tailored with dense MI and MII-type SACs for cascade reactions. By levering the know-how and documented expertise of the host institution on graphene chemistry and single metal atom engineering and of the experienced researcher on biomass valorization and catalysis, Bio2SAF will apply and expand these concepts towards sustainable production of fuels from waste biomass. The Bio2SAF project will thus tackle pressing societal needs to develop technologies for decreasing our dependence on depleting fossil fuel reserves",179986,2024,2026,European Commission,Czechia,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Photo-induced Enantiomeric Separation on chip,"Separating the two enantiomeric versions of a chiral molecule is crucial for ensuring the safety of pharmacological drugs and agrochemicals for the human body and the environment. However, the enantiomeric separation process at industrial level through chiral chromatography is costly and slow. As a result, 90% of chiral pharmaceutical drugs and agrochemicals are being sold as racemic mixtures.

The PiEs-on-chip project aims at exploiting enantio-selective optical forces produced in silicon-based Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) to separate enantiomers. The chiral light-matter interaction, between the light guided throughout the PIC and the enantiomers results in a momentum transfer due to optical forces that move the particles of opposite chirality in opposite directions, leading to their Photo-induced Enantiomeric Separation (PiES). The PIC would be easy to mass-produce at low cost per device, thus, making optical enantiomeric separation more viable at industry level. 

Guided modes along integrated rectangular waveguides demonstrated inherent transversal and/or longitudinal spin which generates chiral optical forces that could be used for separating chiral particles in the transversal and/or longitudinal direction. Although the use of silicon-based waveguides is promising, they still lack more strength in the optical forces that can exert on smaller particles like molecules, partially due to the simple designs of the tested PICs. This requires new strategies to enhance enantio-selective interactions.

The PiES-on-chip novel approach consists in inversely designing the PIC with topology optimization with the objective of maximizing the produced enantio-selective optical forces. Next, we will fabricate the optimized PIC and measure the generated chiral optical forces with Photo-induced Force Microscopy. Finally, we will deliver the chiral particles over the PIC with a microfluidic layer and experimentally verify the laser-driven enantiomeric-separation on chip.",178940,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Multicore Fibers for Future Quantum Networks,"""Amid global uncertainties and evolving geopolitical tensions, ensuring the secrecy of critical communications and safeguarding European technological sovereignty has become paramount. The vulnerabilities of traditional encryption methods have already been exposed and there are indications that certain countries are already employing the """"harvest now, decrypt later"""" principle, emphasizing the urgency for enhanced digital security measures. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a revolutionary approach to secure key exchange, harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to provide perfect secrecy. However, the widespread adoption of QKD still faces significant obstacles, including compatibility issues with existing telecom infrastructure and the current low secure key rates (SKR).

Recent manufacturing advancements in multicore fibers (MCF) place them as a compelling answer, as they offer a host of advantages. For instance, they provide support for spatial-division multiplexing, enabling to reach the SKR capacity demands; they facilitate the integration of quantum and classical networks within a single fiber with a smaller footprint compared to bundles of standard optical fibers; and they enable the distribution of entangled photons, opening the door for multiparty communication. With these capabilities, MCFs assume a pivotal role in constructing the foundation of the future quantum network.

This research explores the potential of MCF for next-generation quantum networks. It aims to introduce and implement a novel space- and wavelength-division multiplexing scheme for high-dimensional (HD) QKD, offering an increased channel capacity and enhanced security. Further, this project studies the distribution of entangled photons over a deployed MCF link and seeks to perform QKD between multiple users. Additionally, it aims to explore the coexistence of quantum information along with real-valued internet traffic.""",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Exotic phases in Raman-coupled quantum gases,"The physical properties of materials are determined by the interactions of their constituents and the emerging band structure. Ultracold atoms have emerged as a powerful tool to simulate these quantum many-body processes in a highly controlled environment. In this project, I will explore exotic phases in bosonic mixtures of ultracold potassium by engineering the interplay of single-particle dispersion relation and interactions via Raman dressing. My research will focus on two distinct scenarios: the continuum and discretized chains. In the continuum case I will focus on the celebrated supersolid stripe phase, which simultaneously displays superfluidity and a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. I will characterize the collective crystal modes of the phase, a smoking gun for supersolidity, as well as realize a novel quantum liquid with supersolid characteristics. In the discretized case, I will explore the effects of strong interactions in artificial gauge fields by realizing semi-synthetic flux ladders, a minimal instance of the Hofstadter model. This model is famous for capturing the fractional quantum Hall effect, but displays a myriad of strongly interacting, yet experimentally scarcely explored phases. The project will demonstrate the vast potential of Raman-coupled systems by deepening our understanding of supersolids and providing new insights into strongly correlated systems in the presence of artificial gauge fields. By using a common mechanism that gives rise to both supersolidity and artificial magnetic flux, the project will, at large, reveal connections between these two important topics.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Topological synchronization of interacting bosons and Floquet engineering,"We are currently witnessing a technological revolution driven by the recent achievements in NISQ devices, which despite their imperfect controllability have already revolutionized our understanding of many-body dynamics and quantum information science. While a lot of effort is spent to minimize the undesirable consequences of dissipation, interactions with the environment can also generate useful quantum behavior. The phenomenon of synchronization is a prototypical example where dissipation is a key enabling mechanism and it only recently started to emerge in the quantum domain due to advancements in quantum technology to exquisitely adjust both the system and environmental properties. Still, inevitable imperfections -- local deformations caused by ambient conditions and long-term degradation -- may significantly alter or even destroy the desired synchronicity altogether, which ultimately constraints its pertinence for future quantum devices. Consequently, we are in the need of universal principles to promote the robustness of synchronization and facilitate its technological leap. The proposed project 'BoFTISync' addresses this task by exploiting the power of topological phases of matter, which exhibit an unusual protection from the adverse effects of impurities. With a unique interdisciplinary approach of integrating topological concepts with dynamical symmetries of interacting bosonic modes and open quantum systems, the project aims to establish topology as an innovative way to protect quantum signatures of synchronization, and at the same time opens the avenue for unexplored phenomena at the interface of these seemingly distinct research areas. This investigation is not only fundamentally interesting, but will also spark new applications in quantum technologies and information processing in NISQ platforms ranging from trapped ions to optomechanics. Thus, BoFTISync will prepare the ground for a deeper understanding on topology in open nonlinear systems.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Quantum boundary conditions for infinite-dimensional control,"Taking advantage of the underlying quantum features of the natural world to design new technologies is the principle at the root of the Second Quantum Revolution. Quantum control theory provides the mathematical substrate to this principle by establishing precise conditions under which a system can be manipulated to reach any desired state in a finite time, and developing systematic methods for accomplishing this goal in an optimal way. This is a formidable task especially for systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, for which advanced mathematical techniques are needed.

The standard approach to quantum control relies on the use of external fields. A significant byproduct of such schemes is the possible loss of quantum correlations between the components of the system resulting from this interaction. An alternative route is achieving control by exploiting boundary effects, that is, manipulating the boundary conditions of the system. This is the idea at the core of Quantum Control at the Boundary (QCB), a promising yet underdeveloped paradigm.

The aim of the project is to investigate the feasibility and shortcomings of QCB, laying the foundations to a systematic theory of boundary control schemes. By adopting and improving known results from infinite-dimensional control theory, the project will elucidate the conditions under which specific QCB schemes, including thick quantum graphs and cavities with moving boundaries, are controllable. The problem of optimal control and the practical implementation of such schemes will also be studied. 

The project draws ideas and techniques from different areas of mathematics and physics, by also requiring familiarity with the laws of Quantum Mechanics. This reflects the scientific background of the applicant. It will involve a significant transfer of knowledge to the host institution, and the training of the researcher from a scientific and a managerial point of view.",178940,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Efficient Stable Multilevel Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions Enabled by Layered 2D van der Waals Heterostructures,"Through ESTRELLA I aim to develop energy efficient (i.e. field-driven), stable (retention time > 10 years), multilevel (16 state/4-bit) two-terminal devices based on 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS).  The project will provide a comprehensive investigation of CIPS material properties both as an exfoliated film and when integrated in ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) devices through multilayer vdW epitaxy. The final devices aim to exploit the atomically sharp interfaces of vdW heterostructures, small domain wall energy and slow but stable switching of CIPS in order to produce a ferroelectric memory suitable for neuromorphic applications. Furthermore, I will investigate the impact of different electrodes on tunnelling electroresistance (TER) and switching voltages in order to design an optimal CIPS-based FTJ. This draws together my experience in the fields of ferroelectric devices and materials characterisation with that of the supervisor (Prof. Luis Hueso, CIC nanoGUNE), who is an expert on 2D materials and van der Waals (vdW) heterointegration. ESTRELLA will target areas of materials science - heterointegration techniques, 2D film characterisation; physics - understanding of domain dynamics and 2D material interfacial interactions; and electrical engineering - targeting FTJ devices as building blocks for neuromorphic computing. Parallel to my scientific work, with ESTRELLA I will develop skills as an independent researcher through publication and dissemination of my work, supervision, collaboration and project organisation.",178940,2025,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Chemical Sciences; Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Two-dimensionAl tRansition-metal dichalcoGEnides-based recTifier for RF harvesting,"In the present day, electromagnetic (EM) signals operating within the radio frequency (RF) range, including Wi-Fi frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz, and cellular telecommunication spanning from 700 MHz to 2.7 GHz,  are becoming increasingly pervasive in indoor and outdoor environments. These signals constitute a prolific and continuous source of RF energy. Harnessing this RF energy holds great potential for powering future distributed electronics. However, before reaching the technology readiness level required for commercial utilization of RF harvesting, numerous factors must be taken into account. Among these considerations, the performance of diodes (rectifiers) is of paramount importance. Indeed, in most cases, the efficacy of the harvester heavily relies on the rectifier. This component ultimately enables switching-type conversions, such as  alternating current to direct current (ac–dc) conversions. The most crucial parameter for assessing the rectification capabilities of a diode technology is the short-circuit current responsivity or the voltage responsivity at zero bias. In this context, graphene-based rectifiers have exhibited remarkable characteristics, including a zero-bias voltage responsivity reaching up to 71 V-1. The TARGET RF project will continue to innovate in emerging materials and device architecture. Specifically, it will concentrate on investigating the responsivity of emerging two-dimensional (2D) technologies for rectifiers, particularly focusing on Rectifiers based on various Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).This pursuit aims to enhance the efficiency of converting RF to DC power, particularly in RF low-power density scenarios. TARGET RF (24 months) will be hosted at the Granada University and will l be supervised by Prof. Francisco Javier Garcia Ruiz, an internationally recognized expert in this area, take advantage, hence, the skills of his researcher's team and the infrastructure.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain; Germany,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
Computational Studies on Heterogeneous Astrocatalysis of Space-Abundant Transition Metals,"The formation of Solar-like planetary systems is a complex process that goes through different steps, where not only physical changes occur but also an increasing of the molecular complexity. This gives rise to a rich chemical diversity and complexity of gas-phase molecular species in different astrophysical environments. However, not all the molecules observed can be formed at this state. The presence of interstellar grains (i.e., submicron-sized solid-state particles ubiquitously present in space) is especially important for the synthesis of molecules that would not form in the gas phase in the abundance required to satisfy observations. Interstellar grains are advocated to infer catalytic effects. However, such a “catalytic role” is associated with enhancing the encountering of the reactive species on the grain surface due to adsorption and diffusion, and the capability of the grains to dissipate the energy excess of largely exothermic reactions. In fact, state-of-the-art research on the field mainly focuses on the reactivity happening on the ices covering the grains and whose capability to reduce activation barriers is rather limited. Nevertheless, other materials beyond ices are also present in interstellar environments and can indeed exhibit catalytic properties. Refractory grains containing space abundant transition metals (such as Fe and Ni) are the perfect candidates to perform as heterogeneous catalysts. By using Fischer-Tropsch (CO + H2) and Haber-Bosch (N2 + H2) processes as model reactions and, by means of quantum chemical simulations, the project CHAOS will present for the first time a complete and deep description of the heterogeneous catalytic processes that can occur in the interstellar medium. The data obtained will go beyond representing the catalytic capacity of such materials in the outer space, it will be further used for predictive purposes as inputs in machine learning models.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Chemical Sciences; Space Sciences
Schrödinger bridges to open quantum systems,"Quantum systems are inherently stochastic. At the quantum level, randomness is introduced not only through the act of measurement, but also due to the uncontrollable interaction with the surrounding environment. Indeed, the precise manipulation of quantum dynamics presents a challenge for emerging quantum technologies, such as computing, simulation, and quantum sensing. On the other hand, optimal transportation and Brownian/Schrödinger bridges are of central importance in applications requiring regulation and estimation of classical stochastic processes. These include unsupervised machine learning, motion planning in robotics or protein docking and single-cell genomics in biology. In this project, we set out to extend these classical theories into the quantum domain. Specifically, we will develop original methods to regulate and estimate the dynamics of open quantum systems. The research will lead to powerful optimization tools for state steering quantum control of noisy quantum dynamics, and will also provide novel insights into the thermodynamics of stochastic quantum processes. Furthermore, the project will deliver new methods to characterize the dynamics of complex quantum systems that better fit experimental observations, thus making a groundbreaking contribution to the theory of open quantum systems. Overall, this research will bridge the gap between mathematics and the next generation of quantum technologies, which will have broad implications, from quantum thermodynamics to quantum sensing or coherent control.",178940,2025,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Dynamical tests of dark matter in Local Group galaxies: shortcomings and new avenues,"The distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and neighbouring Local Group galaxies is an important indicator of the nature of dark matter. Accurately determining the smooth distribution of dark matter in these galaxies and the degree of clumpiness (abundance of luminous and dark satellites) encodes information about the properties of dark matter and the interplay between the baryonic and dark sectors in the formation and evolution of galaxies. As well as being auxiliary quantities in interpreting the results of multichannel dark matter searches. Thanks to significant investments in observational resources by international and, in particular, European countries, we now have access to an enormous amount of detailed, high-quality astronomical data that allow us to view Local Group galaxies as complex systems in interaction with their environment. The DiaLoGues project will help harvest these exquisite data's full potential in interdisciplinary dark matter searches with a hybrid approach. On the one hand, we will address biases in the smooth, galactic-scale distribution of dark matter in current chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and neighbouring dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, we will search for peculiar features in the spatial distribution and kinematics of individual stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies, which will then be confronted with signatures of luminous and dark mergers in state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. In this way, the theoretical link between observations and the accretion history of the host dwarf galaxy will be provided. DiaLoGues will be a transfer-of-knowledge agent between the astroparticle and astrophysics communities, contributing to the interdisciplinary endeavour to constrain the underlying particle physics model that governs dark matter at the microscopic scales.",178940,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain,EU,Particle and High Energy Physics
mItigating stellar magNetic activity Contamination in Transmission spEctroscopy,"Transmission spectroscopy (TS) is a technique, which measures the wavelength-dependent radius of a planet as it transits its star. From this, information about the chemical composition of a planet’s atmosphere can be obtained. The observed transmission spectrum is a combination of the planet and its host star. Inhomogeneities caused by spots and faculae present on stellar surfaces cause temporal changes in the observed transmission spectrum, mimicking a planet’s signal. It is crucial to understand the imprints of faculae and spots on TS to mitigate their signals. Modelling of stellar activity is challenging, and interpreting the stellar signal is full of degeneracies. The community is eager to overcome the stellar contamination conundrum, for which INCITE will propose solutions. INCITE’s objective is to build a methodology for stellar activity mitigation by physically modelling stellar activity in contemporaneous multiple-technique observations. As stellar activity models rely on the knowledge of the surface distribution of magnetic features and their respective brightness spectra, INCITE will combine recent efforts in these areas. The only star for which simultaneous observations of both the distribution of spots and faculae as well as multi-technique observations are available is the Sun. Therefore the first step within INCITE is to accurately model Sun-as-star observables. Another star presents itself as in ideal testbed. GJ 1214 is a cool , small, star, for which observations in multi-techniques, together with observations in TS by NASA’s JWST are available. Based on those two stars, stellar activity indicators that will allow for the most accurate mitigation of stellar activity in TS will be identified. Additionally, extensive studies will be conducted on how different configurations of magnetic fields will affect those activity indices and the mitigation in TS.  This makes INCITE a proof-of concept study highly anticipated by the community.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Flexoelectric control of magnetic textures in 2D oxide membranes,"Freestanding layers of complex oxides are a completely new generation of 2D materials which exhibit a plethora of coupled responses and endow 2D materials with robust correlated groundstates. In this project we explore the control of magnetism in a freestanding oxide driven by the coupling of its ferromagnetic groundstate to strain induced polar structures enabled by the freestanding form.
Deterministic control of magnetic textures (namely skyrmions) is an exciting area of research for its potential to impact computing and information technology. However, the metallic nature of most ferromagnetic materials renders the direct control by electric fields impractical due to screening by free carriers. Developing approaches to direct electric control of ferromagnetism in a single material remains a virgin land to explore.
FLEXOMAG aims at the use of strain induced flexoelectricity in a metallic oxide with strong spin orbit interaction (SrRuO3) to nucleate spin textures, skyrmions and skyrmion lattices. Flexoelectricity enables the creation of a polar structure in the presence of strain gradients, and is expected to impact magnetic ordering via direct coupling of spins with a polar structure by spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, strain gradients will act as effective electric field and would not suffer from the cancellation by screening due to free charges.  Flexoelectric control of magnetism is in itself an important breakthrough in fundamental science and it will further yield a completely novel strategy to tailor spin textures. We will use twistronics of 2D oxides to design skyrmion lattices never observed before in oxides.  Skyrmions and skyrmion lattices are acclaimed information vectors sought in the design of next generation magnetic memories. This research will supply a long sought technological platform to fabricate skyrmions by design.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain; Spain,EU,Quantum Physics
Advancing global SMEFT fits in the LHC precision era,"After more than a decade of data-taking, no direct evidence of new particles has been found at the LHC, suggesting that new physics (NP) might be heavier than the energies currently probed.  Heavy particles can alter interactions among known particles, causing subtle deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a robust framework that allows for a model-independent parametrisation of new interactions, providing us with the tools needed for a successful indirect discovery program. In particular, the peculiar structure of the theory dictates correlations between different observables, motivating global analyses. In this proposal, I develop a strategy to advance global SMEFT interpretations in three key directions. Firstly, I will expand the comprehensiveness of the dataset by including low-energy observables in current global fit methodologies. To accomplish this, renormalization group equations mixing effects must be included in theoretical predictions, as they prescribe how different energy regimes are connected. Secondly, the research project aims to advance the design of optimal observables for global fits by using machine learning techniques, with the goal of maximising sensitivity to NP. Lastly, the ultimate objective of indirect searches is the identification of heavy new particles responsible for the modified interactions; the SMEFT is simply an intermediate step in this endeavour. I will provide the particle physics community with an open-source software that will interface with the output of global SMEFT fits and indicate which heavy particles are disfavoured by the data and which are still viable.
The combination of my expertise in SMEFT analyses and collider phenomenology, along with the host institute's proficiency in advanced statistical methods, flavour physics, and UV matching, provides an ideal setting to successfully execute the proposed tasks and significantly advance indirect searches.",178940,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Regular and Exotic behavior in Hamiltonian and low-dimensional dynamical systems,"REXHALODYN aims at understanding some of the regular and exotic features of Hamiltonian systems, circle maps, and generalized interval exchange transformations, or GIETs. Hamiltonians provide a powerful description of classical mechanics phenomena. Circle maps and GIETs are archetypal examples that illustrate fundamental concepts and phenomena within dynamical systems. Moreover, the latter two offer simplified models that capture essential features of more complex systems; e.g., they appear naturally as Poincaré maps of (locally) Hamiltonian flows on compact surfaces, and thus are closely related to Hamiltonians in this context. 

Within this framework, the words regular and exotic do not have a precise mathematical meaning; however, we use them here to stand for features in each system that are either well-behaved (regular), such as the existence of stable quasi-periodic motions in Hamiltonian, and rigidity phenomena in circle maps and GIETs; and for features that are ill-behaved (exotic), such as sensitive dependence to initial conditions in Hamiltonians or existence of singular invariant measures in circle maps and GIETs. 

Understanding these complementary features deepens our understanding of the systems, their properties, and the underlying mathematical structures that give rise to a rich spectrum of behaviors.

The main objectives of this project are:

-Prove the existence of lower-dimensional invariant tori, associated with a resonant torus with any number of resonances, for general classes (e.g., convex) of near-integrable Hamiltonians.
-Obtain precise estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the unique invariant probability measure of multicritical circle maps with irrational rotation number of bounded type.
-Obtain rigidity results for multicritical circle maps with irrational rotation number.

The research is planned for two years and takes as a basis many of the results and methods developed by the applicant in his previous works.",178939,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Physical Sciences
Rashba Effect-induced non-VOLatile ferroelectric control of spin-orbit coupling in Two-dimensional materials,"The surge of electronic devices in our everyday lives poses severe challenges to the sustainability of our societies. Spintronics stands at the forefront of solutions considered today by leading industrial actors to drastically improve information and communications systems' scalability and power efficiency. 
In this field, most of the efforts focus on information storage based on ferromagnets (FM), readout via spin-charge interconversion (SCI) phenomena, i.e. the conversion of a spin polarisation into a detectable electrical signal, or vice-versa. However, improvements in SCI efficiency are still necessary and solutions for the electrical writing of FM still need to be more efficient and reliable. Ferroelectrics (FE), which naturally break inversion symmetry, may allow an efficient SCI when interfaced with other materials. Since FE also carry information (their electric polarisation) switchable at ultra-low power, they are ideal candidates to replace FM as the new core elements of spintronics. So far, only a few reports demonstrated the FE control of SCI at oxide interfaces or in bulk semiconductors. Due to their richness and 2D nature, van der Waals (vdW) materials and notably graphene play an increasingly important role in spintronics research, and vdW FE could be a game changer for the field, although they are still under-investigated. 
REVOLT aims to study these novel FE and to achieve the non-volatile electric control of SCI in graphene proximitized with FE. Structural, electrical, and magnetotransport characterisations will be performed on atomically sharp FE/graphene stacks patterned with advanced nano-lithography techniques for which the host institution is expert. Based on these efforts, REVOLT will shed new light on fundamental physics phenomena and evaluate the potential for a paradigm change in spintronics applications while providing high-quality, interdisciplinary research and transversal skills to a young researcher for the development of his career.",178939,2025,2027,European Commission,Spain,EU,Engineering; Condensed Matter Physics
Quantum INteracting Topological Optics,"Atom-light interfaces are vital for a range of potential applications in the coming “second quantum revolution”, from secure communication to ultra-precise sensors to quantum computers. A new exciting possibility is to arrange atoms in dense, regular arrays, where wave interference leads to strong collective emission. This property has been shown to polynomially or even exponentially improve the efficiency of single-photon-level applications. A frontier still awaiting a breakthrough is in the many-body regime, in particular, to expand the realm of atom arrays interacting with light toward realizing and studying exotic strongly correlated behavior.

In QUINTO (Quantum INteracting Topological Optics), we will propose routes by which such systems can realize many-body states featuring topological order (TO). TOs have attracted significant interest due to wide-ranging implications ranging from possible fault-tolerant quantum computing to surprising fundamental properties such as the emergence of “anyonic quasi-particles” (being neither bosons nor fermions) and emergent lattice gauge theories. We will use the known physics of TOs within condensed matter physics as a “window” to developing the concept of many-body quantum optics, and show that, in turn, the arrays provide new ways of creating, understanding and measuring TOs.

We will employ innovative, condensed-matter-inspired theoretical and numerical techniques, breaking state-of-the-art limitations (e. g. on system size), to study two routes towards quantum-optical TOs: arrays in optical cavities and “topological bands” in free-space arrays. We aim to: (i) demonstrate that long-range interactions, induced by emission and re-absorption of photons, provides a new paradigm for inducing TOs, (ii) elucidate the influence of such interactions on fundamental TO physics, and (iii) show that the output light carries information sufficient to detect a TO (including signatures of anyons).",178939,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
Multi-level approach for the up-scaling of ultra high temperature energy storage and conversion,"The growing interest for the integration of renewable energy sources, as solar energy, in the global energy mix, increases the need of developing of new methods that will assist on the up-scaling and demonstration of efficient energy storage and conversion technologies. In this regard, advanced modelling methods can be an indispensable tool towards this effort. SHINE aims at developing a holistic numerical methodology – by using in-house codes coupled with commercial software– that will boost the cost-efficient and sustainable electricity production and storage at unprecedented ultra-high temperatures (> 1000 oC). The stepping stone for the modelling activities will be a compact latent heat thermophotovoltaic device recently patented in UPM targeted for energy storage and production at ultra-high temperatures. The core components in such a device are the latent heat thermal energy storage system and the thermophotovoltaic device. The modelling methodology will integrate rigorous multi-physics models (fluid dynamics, heat transfer and optoelectronics) targeted at a component level into a reduced order model (ROM) by using multi-variable polynomial functions. Key in the proposed methodology is the validation of the rigorous models through in-house measurements at ultra-high temperatures that will be undertaken at the host organisation. Key as well is the production of the multi-variable polynomials through artificial neural networks that will be undetaken during the Secondment phase. The whole project is highly interdisciplinary because it integrates highly interrelated diverse disciplines (physics, engineering, optoelectronics, thermo- and fluid-dynamics, photovoltaics and thermal storage, and artificial intelligence-AI) as well as know-how from experiments is a single holistic approach. Once developed the ROM will be used to predict the whole system's performance as being part of a solar-to-heat-to-power and a power-to-heat-to-power concepts.",178939,2024,2026,European Commission,Spain,EU,Engineering; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Relativistic Framework for Attosecond Pump-Probe Induced Dynamics,"Within RAPPID, I will develop a relativistic real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) based approach for simulating out-of-equilibrium processes observed in modern attosecond pump−probe spectroscopies. Their theoretical description presents a formidable task owing to the intricate interplay of electronic and nuclear motions, ionization processes and relativistic effects hallmarked for high energy x-ray photons. 
Our objective is to address all these challenges through the formulation and implementation of mixed quantum-classical electron-nuclear dynamics based on Ehrenfest approach embedded with adaptive scheme with flexible Gaussians to solve the time-dependent electronic equation-of-motion for capturing ionization processes. The backbone of these developments will be the state-of-the-art relativistic atomic mean-field exact two-component (amfX2C) Hamiltonian within the context of RT-TDDFT. 
These goals will be achieved by combining my expertise on ab-initio theory of ionization processes with the expertise of Dr. Repisky in development and implementation of novel relativistic approaches. In summary, RAPPID will deliver an advanced relativistic framework which is capable of describing ultrafast electron-nuclear processes including valence and core states for elements across the periodic table, and aligns synergistically with ongoing experimental endeavours performed for instance in European-XFEL or ELI-ALPS.",178668,2024,2026,European Commission,Slovakia; Norway,EU,"Chemical Sciences; Physical Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
RUI: Nuclear Physics Research with Undergraduate Students: Nuclear Structure Theory and its Applications to Nuclear Astrophysics.,"The project engages Grand Valley State University students in nuclear structure theory and its applications to nuclear astrophysics. The proposed project aims to explore fundamental scientific inquiries, such as the origin of the elements in the universe and the chemical evolution of stars and galaxies. These goals will be achieved through the development of theoretical models for the prediction of nuclear structure properties of stable and the most neutron-rich nuclei and the exploration of the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Computational tools for nuclear structure theory will be developed, evaluated against experimental and theoretical data, and applied in nuclear astrophysics applications. Undergraduate students supported by the project will be offered cutting-edge research opportunities in nuclear theory, helping to train the next generation of STEM workforce through their involvement in code development, drafting scientific manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals, and presenting their work at national conferences. Computational models will be developed to generate nuclear level densities for stable nuclei and those away from stability, which are not accessible in the laboratory. These results will be benchmarked against available experimental data from different databases, state-of-the-art experimental data from FRIB and predictions from other theoretical models. The nuclear level densities play a pivotal role in understanding the formation of elements heavier than iron in the universe. The nuclear level densities will be extrapolated to stellar environment temperatures, enabling the calculation of reliable cross-sections and nuclear reaction rates. These outputs will be used for the exploration of the elemental abundancies produced by the r-process. Undergraduate students will take an active part in every aspect of the research and dissemination of the results. Outreach activities in nuclear physics will also be developed in collaboration with the Regional Math and Science Center of GVSU for K-12 students. This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.

Energetics of quantum correlations,"The proposed project Energetics of Quantum Correlations  aims to establish a comprehensive framework for studying quantum correlations and thermodynamics in continuous variables.
The key research goals established within this project encompass the creation of a universally applicable operational framework delineating the relationship between entanglement and energy manipulation. This framework should be readily employable within the quantum technology sector. Additionally, the project aims to conceive practical applications for harnessing energetic quantum advantages. Lastly, it seeks to formulate an experimental plan for assessing the proposed theory.
To achieve these goals, the project leverages the expertise of both the hosting institution, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), and the partner institution, ICFO. Furthermore, the project emphasises knowledge transfer and collaboration. During the outgoing phase, the researcher will collaborate closely with Prof. Paz's team at UBA, gaining insights into quantum thermodynamics and correlations. In the return phase at ICFO, collaboration with Prof. Acín's Quantum Information Theory group will involve advanced analytical and numerical methods for characterising quantum correlations. 
The project places a strong emphasis on skills transfer. The researcher will actively engage in co-supervising PhD and master's students, enhancing supervisory and management skills. Teaching activities at both institutions will improve pedagogical abilities, while participation in interdisciplinary initiatives will foster networking and knowledge exchange. 
In addition, the project is committed to develop energy efficient quantum technologies, aligning with the MSCA Green Charter.

The geometry of moduli spaces from low-dimensional topology and applications,"Low Dimensional Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies shapes of three and four-dimensional objects. This project explores such objects using tools inspired by modern physics. One such tool is the Yang-Mills equation, used in quantum field theory to describe electro-weak interactions. Solutions to the Yang-Mills equation on a manifold can reveal deep insights into the underlying topology. The construction of configuration spaces on manifolds is inspired by Feynman diagrams; it has recently been used to answer long-standing open problems in low-dimensional topology. These ideas also interact closely with many other areas of mathematics, such as non-linear partial differential equations, algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry. The PI will use the existing tools in gauge theory and configuration space theory to study questions in three- and four-dimensional topology and develop new tools in this field by working on fundamental analytical questions about gauge-theoretic equations. During the project, the PI will train graduate and undergraduate students, organize high school educational activities, and participate in outreach programs to attract more students to mathematics. The research activities of this project will focus on the following three major directions. The first direction studies the higher algebraic structures in instanton Floer homology and its relations with gluings of 3-manifolds. The second direction studies the analytic properties of generalized Seiberg–Witten equations. The third direction explores the applications of Kontsevich configuration space integrals in 4-dimensional topology and uses it to study smooth mapping class groups in dimension 4.

Probabilistic Models with Boundary: Symmetries and Asymptotics,"A major goal of modern probability is to understand the macroscopic behavior of large random systems. This project studies a class of random growth models taking place in different geometric settings and will develop new tools effective for these structures; the aim is to understand the behavior of these systems and the impact of the underlying geometry on this behavior. These systems, for example, might be used to model the growth of cancer along a wall or a cylinder. The extensive algebraic structure underlying integrable or exactly solvable models without boundary has been successfully used to study a variety of probabilistic questions for these models. Many of these models are expected to exhibit universality, meaning that the behavior studied should occur in a wide variety of other models. However, once non-trivial boundary conditions are imposed, our understanding is incomplete. The proposal aims to develop a better understanding of the algebraic structures involved once boundary conditions are imposed and to use this structure to attack probabilistic problems. In particular, the work aims to find new hidden symmetries for these models and to establish asymptotic results via new exact formulas for models with boundary. Undergraduate students will participate in the research, continuing the awardee's record of student mentorship, and the work will be disseminated at seminars and conferences.

Pattern formation in systems of magnetic spinners,"The collective behavior of magnetic particles in rotating fields opens challenging physical questions and suggests their role as model systems for nonlinear behavior in soft matter physics. Their non-equilibrium phase diagrams show a wide range of patterns. From the experimental perspective, the control by an external magnetic field of collective dynamics of particles with permanent dipoles, namely magnetic spinners, offers a promising route for applications such as chiral fluids, cargo transport, and targeted delivery. However, the full comprehensive understanding of pattern control of the magnetic-responsive aggregates remains challenging and it lacks a profound investigation, which is crucial for future applications. This proposal aims to investigate the pattern formation in systems of magnetic spinners by theoretical approaches, which are compared to experimental data, to find characteristic parameters and rules. Studies will make use, of particle-resolved computer simulations such as Langevin Dynamics Simulation, based on Langevin equations to investigate the interplay among magnetic, hydrodynamics, and lubrication interaction.",175896,2024,2026,European Commission,Latvia,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Overturning Size Effects in Ferroelectric Thin Films,"The rapid increase in power consumption for data collection, storage and processing drives a global interest in finding new energy-efficient device paradigms. Ferroelectric materials can provide energy-efficient solutions for targeted applications such as transistors based on polarization-induced negative capacitance or memory devices based on polarization-controlled resistive switching. The crucial properties of ferroelectric-based heterostructures in electronic applications are remanent polarization, coercive voltage and leakage current because they limit the ON/OFF ratio, energy efficiency and charge transport properties of any device. However, uncompensated bound charge and defects at ferroelectric interfaces result in polarization suppression, increase of coercive voltage and uncontrolled charge carrier formation. The purpose of OSE-Ferroelectrics is to assess the possibility of tackling these size effects in ferroelectric thin films. In OSE-Ferroelectrics, I propose a path to an ambitious goal of overturning ferroelectric size effects by tailoring the heterostructure design and tracking the resulting crystal, electronic and ferroelectric properties. The two cornerstones of the proposal are: (i) adoption of combination of scanning-probe and optical techniques to locally evaluate the crystal, defect, and ferroelectric properties, and (ii) use of independent evaluation of electronic structure, charge carrier concentration and mobility to understand the charge transport properties across ferroelectric interfaces. The research questions and methods addressed in OSE-Ferroelectrics will advance the knowledge of ferroelectric size effects, bring attention to semiconducting properties of ferroelectric layers, and reveal routes for enhancing performance of ferroelectric memory devices.

2D Semiconductor Ferroelectric based Switchable Optoelectronics,"The world is foreseeing future electronics in demand of miniaturization, quantum efficiency, and low power consumption with the emergence of novel two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials.  2D materials' ultra-thin size, band gap engineering, and structural designing demonstrates high-performance optoelectronic devices but lacks novel materials or manipulation mechanisms to achieve low dark current, high absorption/emission efficiency, and low cost of production. Ferroelectric materials can modulate the mobility, carrier concentration, and band alignment in these 2D materials resulting in non-volatile control of photonic and optoelectronic properties. α-In2Se3, a ferroelectric semiconducting material by virtue of its peculiar crystal structure inheriting both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane polarization (OOP) at room temperature is a game changer that manipulates the band bending and carrier transport can be non-destructive and controllable in the ferroelectric–optoelectronic hybrid systems.

Commutative Algebra methods for Hilbert schemes and beyond,"Polynomial equations are ubiquitous in science, describing important physical principles and serving as mathematical models for complex natural phenomena. Algebraic geometry studies geometric structures arising from solutions to systems of polynomial equations. To gain a better understanding of these structures, it is useful to study how they change when the corresponding equations are slightly perturbed. This is achieved by studying a “parameter space” for these structures. The overarching goal of this project is to use techniques from commutative algebra to tackle longstanding questions related to the Hilbert scheme, a parameter space for polynomials with fixed properties. The project’s broader impacts include developing new packages for the open-source computer algebra system Macaulay2, organizing local seminars, and organizing mathematical conferences. The investigator will focus on three areas of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry: 1) Singularities of the Hilbert scheme of points on a threefold: The main goal is to understand the singularities of the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth threefold. In particular, the investigator will focus on determining the smooth points and explaining some of the patterns appearing in the structure of the singularities. 2) Exploring multigraded Hilbert schemes and other moduli spaces: The investigator will study the space of branch varieties, a close analogue of the Hilbert scheme, and focus on studying the projectivity of this moduli space. 3) Varieties in weighted projective spaces: The investigator will focus on developing a set of tools to extend classical theorems in projective space, such as Macaulay’s theorem on the existence of Hilbert functions and the del Pezzo-Bertini classification of varieties of minimal degree, to weighted projective spaces.

"Boosting Algorithmic Efficiency: Numerical Relativity in Dynamical, Curvilinear Coordinates","This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's ""Windows on the Universe"" Big Idea. Einstein’s theory of general relativity (GR) provides science's current best understanding of gravity. It predicts the existence of bizarre objects like black holes and neutron stars, and ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. These predictions motivated the construction of NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which has detected several gravitational wave signals from colliding black holes and neutron stars over the past years. For their efforts in making these detections possible, the leaders of LIGO were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Much of gravitational wave (GW) science depends on GW observations being compared with millions of theoretical predictions, which must be built upon GW catalogs extracted from numerical relativity (NR) simulations. NR simulations solve the GR equations in full on the computer, and to date each of these NR simulations has required a small computing cluster, which has limited throughput to only about 3,000 GWs in 15 years. Given the vast number of possible scenarios for even the simplest and most commonly observed GW source, binary black holes (BBHs), such a small GW collection threatens potential science gains from future GW observations. BlackHoles@Home is a proposed citizen-science project leveraging new techniques to fit NR BBH simulations on a consumer-grade desktop computer, enabling new GW catalog generation with unprecedented throughput using volunteer computers. Such throughput will enable far more detailed analyses of observed GWs from current and future GW detectors, maximizing the science gained from hard-fought observations. To educate the public and advertise this volunteer computing project both locally and globally, convocations will be given in underserved high schools, and updates will be posted to a widely disseminated BlackHoles@Home email newsletter. Improvements to the algorithmic and mathematical underpinnings of NR codes have recently culminated in a coming-of-age for the field, moving it beyond proof-of-principle calculations and into the realm of predictive astrophysics. Over the past six years, NR-based theoretical predictions of gravitational waves (GWs) were central to uncovering the binary parameters in LIGO and Virgo's recent GW discoveries. Looking ahead, GW catalogs generated by NR simulations of compact binaries will need to grow greatly to ensure that parameter estimation accuracy can keep up with increased sensitivity of GW interferometers. BlackHoles@Home is a proposed BOINC project that aims to fit binary black hole (BBH) simulations on the consumer-grade desktop computer. In doing so the general public can be enlisted to help generate the large GW catalogs that form the foundation for a great deal of GW science. Traditionally, these BBH simulations have been performed on supercomputers. BlackHoles@Home implements new approaches for robustly solving Einstein's equations of general relativity in highly efficient coordinate systems, so that these simulations will fit on consumer-grade desktop computers in only a few gigabytes of RAM. BlackHoles@Home's core infrastructure provides a firm foundation for compact binary simulations beyond BBHs. To this end, the dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code IllinoisGRMHD will be incorporated into this infrastructure to enable state-of-the-art binary neutron star simulations on supercomputers. These simulations will leverage both recent advances in solving the GRMHD equations in spherical-like coordinate systems, as well as recent improvements to IllinoisGRMHD that add both advanced nuclear equation of state support and basic neutrino physics. Monte-Carlo-based photon and neutrino feedback will also be incorporated to enable state-of-the-art realism in these binary neutron star simulations.

COSMOlogy employing MAchine Learning Techniques and Advanced statistics,"Some of the biggest open problems in modern cosmology are the nature of the cosmic dark sector, the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted versus the observed value of the cosmological constant, and the growing cosmological discordances and tensions between different observational probes. Notably, the Hubble constant, which describes how fast the Universe is expanding when measured locally, has an enormous statistical disagreement with that inferred from the early Cosmic Microwave Background data. These inconsistencies, in turn, necessitate the formulation of new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. Current and ongoing observations, together with upcoming surveys, will produce large volumes of data, whose accumulation and processing will require an upgradation and increase in the sophistication of our statistical tools before applying them to specific problems. Thus, we propose to build a deep learning architecture using advanced statistics in machine learning algorithms like neural networks to be integrated into cosmological community codes for emulated parameter inference. This will help us to select, in a model-independent way, generic features of some cosmological theories that satisfy all observations. Utilising the power of deep learning will be an ideal space to investigate new physics in the observational sector and discriminate between models that are degenerate in terms of current observational approaches, fostering the development of data-driven science as a valuable companion to the model-driven paradigm. The fellowship will contribute to the researcher's career development by acquiring advanced skills in machine learning approaches using Bayesian statistics and developing skills within the cosmological community through a series of events designed to disseminate his results to the broader public. The project will also serve to consolidate and extend the researcher's network of professional contacts within Europe and beyond.",174721,2025,2027,European Commission,Malta,EU,Information and Computing Sciences; Machine Learning; Particle and High Energy Physics
Quantum Memory interface based on multicolor unconditional quantum teleportation,"Quantum Memories are crucial technologies in Quantum Communications infrastructures. The ability to store and retrieve quantum information can simplify a complex process and increase the flexibility of current communication networks. For this reason, different quantum systems are currently being investigated to produce stable and reliable quantum memories(CITE). Despite their potential, the practical application of these technologies is hindered by intrinsic limitations in their read/write process which is generally based on an optical link. This coupling depends on the specific phenomenon used to store the quantum information, and it imposes stringent requirements on the optical wavelengths used as interface. As a result, two issues arise: Firstly, it's not feasible to connect quantum memories with incompatible wavelengths, and secondly, most quantum memories cannot be integrated with standard communication channels. Thus, implementing Quantum Memories in real-case applications requires developing a new writing/reading approach to overcome this constraint.
 In this project, I will demonstrate that unconditional quantum teleportation can overcome the wavelenght requirement. This communication protocol uses both a quantum and classical channel to transfer quantum information between two distinct systems. By employing a two-colour Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) vacuum-squeezed entangled state as the quantum channel, we can restrict the quantum memory's constraints to just one side of the connection, enabling us to choose the second wavelength based on the external device. I will carry out this project in collaboration with the Danish Center for Quantum Optics (Quantop) led by Prof. Eugene Polzik at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH).",174491,2024,2025,European Commission,Denmark,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Pushing the Boundaries of Sensitivity in Fundamental Physics: Modern Machine Learning for Enhanced CMS and LIGO experiments,"Fundamental physics models like the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) or general relativity have been refined over decades in close interplay with experiments. They can describe phenomena such as the Higgs boson and gravitational waves with incredible precision. Despite their success, current models are known to be incomplete because, for example, they lack explanations for astrophysical phenomena like dark matter and a uniform theory of all forces including gravity. Open questions are addressed by a large number of new physics (NP) models. However, no statistically significant signs of NP have been observed indicating that observing NP is only possible through more data, more sophisticated analysis methods or new experiments.At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the current Run 3 is expected to double the recorded collision data, and the high-luminosity (HL-LHC) upgrade will again enlarge the datasets by about a factor of ten. Upgrades to the gravitational wave observatories will increase the sensitivity to low-frequency signals, doubling e.g. LIGO's sensitivity. While these upgrades provide excellent conditions for NP searches, they also come with challenges for data recording, selection, and analysis, the major task being identification of tiny signals in overwhelming backgrounds.In the last years, machine learning (ML) methods have been on the rise, not only but also because dedicated hardware allows the training and inference of large deep neural networks. ML enables fast decision-making and interpretation with performances that transcend other strategies. Thus, it has been proven an ideal tool to handle the ever-increasing amount of data and to identify faint signals, common challenges in high-energy and gravitational wave physics.Experiments are not capable of storing the complete data triggering the need for in-time filtering of events. Discarded events are ultimately lost for physics analysis. The aim of this project is to develop optimized event selection and identification algorithms utilizing ML methods for the in-time event selection of the CMS and LIGO experiments to enhance sensitivity to NP signals. For the CMS experiment, I propose the first ultrafast isolated electron identification algorithm to be deployed at the initial, hardware-based layer of the trigger system specifically enhancing the sensitivity to low-energetic electrons. For the LIGO experiment, I aim to speed up localization and parameter estimation of gravitational wave events, allowing to extract in-time a large variety of characteristics. Fast parameter estimation would improve multi-messenger astronomy because it allows fast sharing of accurate information about gravitational wave events, beyond the source localization, enabling better and quicker reactions of international space observatories. Besides the initial event selection, sensitivity to NP can be enhanced by interpreting results not in terms of one specific NP model, but model independently. This project proposes the first model-agnostic analysis with the CMS experiment targeting events with large-radius jets and being based on modern ML tools. Inputs are proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS experiment during the current Run 3.The project contributes to extending the physics reach of the CMS and LIGO experiments by overcoming current limitations in event selection and interpretation with state-of-the-art ML. This will prepare the experiments for challenges imposed by the ever increasing data rate, enhance their sensitivity to NP and ultimately help to broaden our knowledge about fundamental physics.",173914,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Higher Representation Theory and Subfactors,"This project will involve research into quantum symmetry. The notion of symmetry is fundamental in classical physics. A famed result of Emmy Noether shows that for each symmetry of the laws of nature, there is a resulting conserved physical quantity. For example, the time invariance of the laws of physics results in the law of conservation of energy. In the setting of quantum physics, the more general notion of quantum symmetries is required to understand the behavior of the system. This project concerns the study of how quantum symmetries act on certain systems, with the end goal being to fully understand and classify these actions. We refer to these actions of quantum symmetries as `higher representation theory’. Particular emphasis will be placed on the examples which are relevant to topological quantum computation. This project will involve research opportunities for undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire. More technically, the notion of quantum symmetry is characterized mathematically by a tensor category, and the actions of quantum symmetries are characterized by module categories over these tensor categories. This project will study fundamental problems on the construction and classification of module categories. The following research problems will be addressed: 1) construct and classify the module categories over the tensor categories coming from the Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, 2) construct new continuous families of tensor categories which interpolate between the categories coming from conformal field theories, 3) use Jones’s graph planar algebra techniques to study Izumi’s near-group tensor categories, and 4) investigate the higher categorical objects related to the module categories in 1). This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

Coherent Phenomenon in Rydberg atoms,"The project is devoted to theoretical studies of coherent optical phenomena in multilevel Rydberg atoms under external magnetic field by using vortex beams. The applicant will investigate the parity-time (PT) symmetry condition via optical vortex light in Rydberg atoms. Then, he will proposed a novel model for efficient transformation of the probe energy from zero order of diffraction to the higher orders in the PT symmetry condition. After that he will propose a model for measurement of external magnetic field as well as orbital angular momentum transfer in a Rydberg atom via optical vortex light. It is expected that these studies will lead to future feasible experiments, and have technological impact on quantum photonics applications in EIT-based devices, storage and manipulation of light, quantum computing and information. In addition, the project will contribute to the personal and professional growth of the fellow, via training of his communication, management and other soft skills.",171669,2025,2027,European Commission,Lithuania,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Baryonic Semitauonic Measurements for Beyond Standard Model Searches,"In the field of particle physics today, the search for what lies beyond our Standard Model is a long-awaited goal. My proposal will push forward this search and potentially uncover what we refer to as new physics.  I will be measuring a unique decay that involves the transition of Lambda baryon to a tau lepton. This decay is an excellent avenue to test one of the main pillars of our Standard Model, an aspect referred to as Lepton Flavour Universality (LFU).   Specifically, I will examine the ratio of the rates of Lambda decay to the tau lepton, as compared to the other two leptons, the electron and muon.  This ratio is expected to have a value of 1 in the SM. However, similar measurements, with other parent particles,  have been done at 3 other leading particle physics experiments, and a deviation from the SM expectation has been observed. As an expert in the field, I have performed one of these measurements at the Belle II experiment in a channel involving the decay of a B meson. At LHCb, I have unique  access to the Lambda channel and this will allow me to perform a highly anticipated measurement in the field, one which will help complete the picture for LFU tests of the SM. Based on my wide experience at Belle II, I will perform this measurement with improved sensitivity and extend the scope of this LFU test to involve angular observables. The latter are more interesting, since contrary to the ratio, angular observables can help uncover the nature of any new physics, if it exists. To achieve my goal, I will develop a novel multivariate technique based on high-impact variables from the event information to suppress the persistent backgrounds in LHCb's noisy environment. I will also examine at new Lambda decay sub-channels, ones that have never been measured before. With my precision measurement, I will confirm or annul a persistent anomaly in the field. What ever the result, I will impact our current  understanding of the origin of our universe.",170612,2025,2027,European Commission,Hungary,EU,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Collaborative Research: Generation and manipulation of spatially entangled states of structured photon pairs with 2D material quantum holograms,"Nontechnical description: Quantum entanglement is one fundamental phenomenon in quantum physics, which lies at the heart of future applications in quantum computing, communication, and information processing. Development of the sources of entangled photon pairs is important for the quantum science and technology. One common method to generate entangled photon pairs is spontaneous parametric down-conversion in second-order nonlinear crystals. Spatially entangled states of photon pairs are crucial for realizing high-capacity quantum computing, communication, and information processing, but the existing schemes to generate these states are based on bulky nonlinear crystals and free-space components. A major challenge is how to realize miniaturized spatially entangled photon-pair sources with nanometer thickness and high performance for on-chip quantum state engineering. In this project, a new concept of ultrathin 2D material quantum holograms will be demonstrated for directly generating and manipulating spatially entangled states of photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This research will benefit many emerging applications in integrated quantum light sources, quantum photonic chips, 2D material-based quantum optics, and quantum state engineering. This project also includes educational activities for training graduate students, recruiting underrepresented and female students, and mentoring high school students. Technical description: High-dimensional maximally entangled states with spatial degree of freedom provide a crucial resource for realizing high-capacity quantum computing, communication, and information processing. However, the existing schemes to generate these spatially entangled states are based on bulky nonlinear crystals and free-space components, which greatly limits the development of ultracompact entangled quantum light sources. The goal of this project is to explore a new concept of ultrathin 2D material quantum holograms based on 2D materials with giant second-order nonlinearities for directly generating and manipulating spatially entangled states of structured photon pairs. In this project, the design, sample fabrication, and experimental characterization of ultrathin 2D material quantum holograms will be performed to demonstrate the direct generation and manipulation of spatially entangled photon pairs. The unique 2D material quantum holograms producing specific spatial mode profiles are designed and demonstrated for engineering the maximally entangled states with the tailored weights and phases. This project will advance the integration of quantum light sources and quantum photonic devices based on 2D materials into the next-generation quantum chips.

Unraveling the ultrafast plasma dynamics giving rise to the measured evolution filamentary structures using high-resolution X-ray Imaging,"Recent progress in Ultra-High Intensity optical laser systems together with the advent of Free Electron Lasers has enabled the possibility to experimentally study hot dense plasmas with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This early state of the plasma is prone to several ultrafast phenomena relevant for astrophysical scenarios – such as Gamma-Ray Bursts - and plasma-based technologies – such as Inertial Fusion Energy. Recently, thanks to the a novel high-resolution X-ray imaging system, an experimental campaign hosted at the Linac Coherent Light Source has resolved for the first time the sub-micron scale plasma filaments originated in the interaction of a high intensity laser with a thin solid target. These results open a unique opportunity to unravel the underlying physical mechanisms behind the formation and evolution of these filaments of relevance to the aforementioned scenarios. The proposed PLasma Advanced X-ray Imaging project will leverage these recent developments with improved diagnostics and the help of advanced numerical simulations that will transform the exploration and quantitave identification of the main physical processes that dictate the onset and non-linear evolution of the relativistic plasma filamentation instability. This project will bring together the fields of advanced X-ray imaging and High Energy Density Physics, and is expected to enable the visualization of ultra-fast processes in solid-density plasmas in a similar way as optical imaging is now-a-days routinely used in underdense plasmas. The outcomes of the PLAXI project will shed light on the extreme processes that control energy transport in gamma-ray bursts and fast igniting plasmas, which so far could only be assessed theoretically, paving the way to new plasma-based applications.",169701,2024,2026,European Commission,Portugal; United States,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Resonant excitation of  phonons in semiconductor nanostructures exploiting open optical cavity,"Phonons are vibrations of atoms in solids that play a significant role in material science and solid-state physics. High-frequency phonons have gained attention in the fields of quantum technology and nanophononics. Their small wavelengths make them compatible with quantum nano-devices and their frequencies can surpass modern computation speeds. This potential makes phonons useful for qubits, quantum memories, hybrid systems, and elements in quantum computing networks. Exploring phonons and their interactions with other excitations is important for advancements in solid-state physics and quantum technology.

The project focuses on using a novel experimental method based on the optical open cavity to excite and detect coherent phonons in materials from the II-VI group of semiconductors. We plan to grow samples with an acoustic cavity enclosed in Distributed Bragg Reflectors, which support the cavity acoustic mode. By placing the sample inside the open optical cavity and adjusting its length, we can sweep the energy of the excitation photon, allowing comprehensive studies on the influence of photon energy on phonon generation efficiency. Additionally, we can achieve quasi-resonant excitation of phonons in the time domain by adjusting the length of the cavity in a way that the round-trip time of the laser pulse matches the frequency of the generated phonons, resonantly pumping the desired phonon frequency supported by the acoustic cavity. This experimental scheme will allow us to enhance the efficiency of phonon excitation by exploiting four resonances for coherent phonon generation: acoustic cavity resonance, optical cavity resonance, excitonic resonance, and in-phase (temporal) resonance excitation.

As a result of the project we expect to provide a comprehensive study on the efficiency of the high-frequency coherent phonon generation in the II-VI semiconductor nanostructures obtained by innovative experimental technique exploiting optical open cavity.",168637,2024,2026,European Commission,Poland,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Generalized nonextensive power-law transverse momentum spectra and their applications in high-energy collision physics,"High energy collision events (proton-proton, lead-lead etc.) create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a state of matter in which the micro-second old universe existed. Distribution of particles created in these events help understand the properties of QGP. Experiments (e.g., the LHC at CERN) have given rise to many theoretical and phenomenological studies attempting to describe particle (hadron) production, which follows a power-law distribution, using statistical models. Hadron spectra generated in high-energy collisions are described by nonextensive distributions in the transverse momentum space represented by two parameters, the nonextensivity parameter q and temperature T. The nonextensive distributions approach the Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions in the limit q approaching 1. The nonextensive distributions, widely used in the phenomenological studies, can be calculated from statistical mechanics using constrained maximization of a generalized nonextensive entropy. The project GLITTER concentrates on these distributions and is divided into two parts: theory and phenomenology. In the theory part, the analytical form of the most generalized nonextensive transverse momentum spectra without an existing procedural arbitrariness will be calculated using nonextensive statistical mechanics for a simple harmonic oscillator. Also, a nonextensive model for an anisotropic medium will be proposed for arbitrary energy using the Mellin-Barnes representation. In the second part,  phenomenological implications of these models will be explored using the ROOT programs that will be set up using the expertise of the supervisor's group. The project will propose analytical nonextensive models generalizing existing results and leading to reduced computation time. It will also clear the ambiguity regarding the usage of various forms of nonextensive distributions, will offer a firm basis for the studies in the field, and will generate many updated information about the properties of QGP.",168636,2024,2026,European Commission,Poland,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
New approaches to strongly correlated quantum matter,"Identifying, understanding and exploring exotic phases of quantum systems is one of the great challenges of modern physics. Most notably, this pursuit has lead to the discovery of a particularly interesting class of unconventional quantum states with intrinsic topological order, known as quantum spin liquids. These phases are defined by their exotic properties which include fractionalized excitations, emergent gauge fields and long-range entanglement, connecting them to high-energy physics, high-Tc superconductivity and quantum information processing. Yet, given their fragility, correlated nature and subtle observables, clear signatures in solids could so far only be observed in fractional quantum Hall states. Accordingly, few systems are known in which spin liquids and exotic superconductivity can be studied in a controlled fashion.During my postdoc I will tackle some of these problems by building on recent experimental breakthroughs in both solids and synthetic quantum systems. To this end I will develop models and new observables tailored to these emerging platforms, with the goal of preparing new topologically ordered quantum states and studying their phase transitions, dynamics and connections to unconventional theories of superconductivity.",167135,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
The epistemology of dark matter and modified gravity,"ANDROMEDA is an unprecedented study regarding the philosophy and epistemology of dark matter and modified gravity. The project will synthesize existing knowledge from cosmology and philosophy of science in order to realize an innovative and original study of the epistemological foundations of the debate between theories of dark matter and theories of modified gravity as competing explanations of specific cosmological observations.  The main objectives of ANDROMEDA are (a) to develop a philosophically informed historical narrative of the parallel development of dark matter theory and modified gravity as an alternative, (b) to identify the most appropriate epistemic values by which dark matter and modified gravity theories should be assessed and compared to each other, and (c) to examine the extent to which certain models of dark matter and modified gravity theory should be evaluated as mutually exclusive and competing explanations of certain phenomena. The clear elucidation of these issues will create new avenues for a constructive dialogue between the dark matter and modified gravity communities in physics and will advance the public understanding of theory choice in astrophysics, demonstrating how philosophy can (i) make useful and substantial contributions to an important on-going scientific problem, and (ii) facilitate the communication of scientific challenges to the public.",166141,2024,2026,European Commission,Greece,EU,Philosophy and Religious Studies; History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields; Particle and High Energy Physics
Ultrafast dynamics of condensed matter in VUV/XUV regime,"Light is the fastest known carrier of information. This information can be exchanged with matter upon electro-magnetic coupling with particles such as electrons. However, the response of mater is not as fast, and usually accompanied by delays associated with photoexcitation, transport of charge and subsequent scattering. These delays add up to form the response time of medium. Scattering also leads to the reduction of light-matter conversion efficiency. Therefore, optimisation of a medium towards fastest response time and scattering-less charge transport are of large importance for future application in optoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics and quantum computing.Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a novel type of a medium with unique properties. Correlated particles (photons, excitons, electrons) may create exotic states with microscopic quantum phenomena, such as Mott insulation, topological insulation or electron-hole liquids. These states deliver electrical, optical, and thermal functionalities, such as a reduction of scattering and fast charge transport. These materials can therefore provide a novel transport mechanism. Studies on novel 2D materials have been limited to date due to constrains of experimental methods that prevent accessing and disentangling very fast and complex charge dynamics.The proposal aims to deliver a new universal metrology to address ultrafast intra-pulse charge dynamics in various media with spectral signatures across multi-octave bandwidth and the temporal resolution beyond the state-of-the art.

Super-resolution microscopy for semiconductor metrology,"Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized imaging by breaking what was believed to be unbreakable: the diffraction limit – which determines what a microscope can resolve. However, many disciplines in science and engineering cannot benefit from super-resolution microscopy, because practically all current super-resolution microscopes require fluorescence, often introduced by labelling – that is chemically modifying – the samples of interest. 
The semiconductor industry is the driver of digitization by producing ever smaller integrated circuits for faster computer chips, and has worldwide importance. The critical dimensions of the latest generation of chips are in the nanometer range, enabled by the breakthrough technology of extreme-ultraviolet nanolithography. An efficient production process requires constant quality inspection of the printed features, either directly on the integrated circuits or on dedicated metrology targets. However, the resolution of current all-optical microscopy-based metrology methods cannot keep pace with the fast development of smaller structures by nanolithography.
Within my ERC Starting Grant, I demonstrated that high-harmonic generation – that is the frequency upconversion of laser pulses – can be optically suppressed and spatially confined in semiconductors without the need for labelling. This can be utilized as sub-diffraction emission for super-resolution scanning microscopy. I will further develop this technique in MICROSEM in order to reach resolution below 100 nm in a conventional optical microscope operating in the visible and ultraviolet region, without the need of complicated vacuum equipment. This will enable crucial applications for semiconductor wafer metrology. I will demonstrate new in-device metrology, and pave the way for additional advanced at-resolution metrology schemes. To ensure knowledge transfer I enlisted one of the key players in the semiconductor industry as collaborator for MICROSEM.",162369,2024,2026,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Gamma-Neutron Vision aimed at improved cancer treatments in Hadron Therapy,"Proton therapy represents one of the most recent and adavanced tools in cancer treatment, especially for complex cases and pediatric patients. Despite its exponential deployment worldwide, hadron therapy still faces two main limitations, which are related to: i) accurate ion-range verification and ii) assessment of the secondary (unwanted) neutron dose. The present proposal presents an innovative tool, that can help to improve this situation and thus increase the potential benefits of hadron therapy. This project focuses on a portable device, that can simultaneously image both gamma-rays and thermal neutrons, which are ineluctably produced during the treatment. On one hand, imaging thermal neutrons may help to quantify more reliably the secondary neutron dose received by the patient during therapy. Complementary gamma-ray imaging is accomplished with the same apparatus by means of electronic collimation, thus enabling real-time assessment of the ion-range. In terms of gamma-vision, the system has been recently tested in pre-clinical conditions at CNA-Seville and HIT-Heidelberg. This POC project aims therefore at demonstrating the additional neutron-vision capability, thereby elevating the full GNVision system to TRL6, and addressing its commercial viability in the health-sector.",162369,2024,2025,ERC,Spain,EU,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Versatile Integrated Brillouin-Kerr Frequency Combs for On-Chip Photonic Systems,"An ultra-stable, low-noise optical frequency comb seamlessly integrated into a compact chip-scale form factor has the potential to revolutionize precision measurements, radiofrequency and optical communications, and quantum technologies.  Today’s chip-scale frequency combs can achieve stable, phase-locked and broadband emission, but they suffer from high noise that blocks the pathway towards more stringent applications such as microwave photonics.  

Brillouin optomechanics, a nonlinear optical effect relying on coherent coupling of photons and acoustic phonons, can enable on-chip lasers with ultra-low noise and high purity.  My ERC Proof of Concept project Veritas will build on initial breakthroughs of harnessing Brillouin optomechanics in silicon nitride and aim to deliver the first chip-scale low-noise frequency combs. I will explore system applications of these combs for agile frequency conversion in 6G radio systems and for coherent optical communications.  Along with these technological developments, I will perform a thorough market study with appropriate IP measures, maximizing the commercial potential of this technology. 

We expect that our results in Veritas will point to the feasibility of this technology for software-defined reconfigurable front-ends for very high frequency and size and weight-sensitive RF applications.",162368,2024,2025,ERC,Netherlands,EU,Classical Physics; Quantum Physics
Quantum Tensor Engine,"Quantum computers harness fundamental aspects of quantum behavior to drive exponential increases in the speed with which certain computations can be performed. They have potentially a tremendous long-term impact in areas such as quantum-many body physics and material science, and further afield in machine learning. The quantum many-body problems studied by condensed matter physicists are perhaps the most likely to yield early demonstrations of this potential. However, current and near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are limited in the number of operations that they can carry out before their performance is degraded by interactions with the environment. To take advantage of these platforms and to outperform classical computers, highly efficient and specialized quantum algorithms are required. The implementation and benchmarking of these basic algorithms on different quantum computing platforms is challenging and requires a detailed knowledge of the underlying physics. Our approach is to produce a ready-to-use, highly innovative software package based upon quantum tensor networks. The Quantum Tensor Engine (QTEngine) will provide a unifying framework for both quantum and classical algorithms.

Ultrafast Cathodoluminescence Spectroscopy  with  Coherent Electron-Driven Photon Sources,"""Exploring the optical responses of materials at the nanoscale is central to various fields of study, including quantum-sensitive measurement metrologies, photovoltaics, and optoelectronic devices. Electron probes have established themselves as important tools for visualizing nano-optical excitations with unprecedented spatial resolution. However, controlling optical excitations and exploring their decoherence dynamics require visualizing the dynamics of the nano-world at sub-femtosecond temporal resolutions.
Within the context of our ERC Starting Grant """"NanoBeam,"""" we have established and proposed an electron-probe technique that not only allows us to explore dynamics at nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolutions but also does so at a low cost. Unlike state-of-the-art ultrafast electron microscopy, our method does not rely on external laser excitations but rather on internal electron-driven photon sources.
To visualize the decoherence dynamics in a variety of systems, including quantum emitters and networks, optical excitations of two-dimensional materials, and semiconducting optoelectronic devices, we plan to merge the electron-driven photon sources with a cathodoluminescence spectroscopy setup based on optical fiber technology. We will design piezo stages and sample holders that enable precise alignment and tuning of the sample, electron-driven photon sources, and fibers inside the microscope while efficiently collecting cathodoluminescence photons.
Our electron-driven photon sources are designed to facilitate a high photon yield, allowing for optimal investigation of nonlinear processes. The instrument will be tested and verified for applications in mapping the decoherence dynamics of quantum emitters coupled to photonic structures, optical excitations in two-dimensional materials, and charge transfer dynamics in photovoltaic devices.""",162368,2024,2025,ERC,Germany,EU,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Colloidal Indium Arsenide quantum dots as short-wave infrared single photon emitters,"MOONSHOT aims at developing a novel single-photon emitting material that operates in the telecommunication wavelength range (1300-1600 nm, O- and C-bands) and is compliant with the “Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment” (RoHS). The main motivation for such objective is that single-photon sources based on epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) are now a mature technology available on the market that is outperforming laser cooled atoms or spontaneous parametric down conversion via nonlinear crystals. Yet, three major issues afflict epitaxial QDs: first, the epitaxial approach presents drawbacks in terms of limited throughput and CMOS incompatibility. Secondly, often the emission wavelength of epitaxial QDs for single-photon generation is limited to less than 1000 nm. Finally, single-photon sources based on this class of QDs require low-temperature operation (T ≈ 4K). Colloidal QDs present similar light-emission properties to their epitaxial counterpart and they can tackle most of the drawbacks of the latter. For example, solution processing enables controlled placement of QDs on-chip as well as very high throughput preparation via wet-chemistry approaches. In addition, colloidal QDs have the potential for operation beyond cryogenic temperatures. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art colloidal QDs with shortwave infrared emission (SWIR, 750-1600 nm) contain either lead or mercury, which are severely restricted by the RoHS. Indium arsenide (InAs) QDs are among the few SWIR-emitting RoHS-compliant materials; yet only a limited number of synthetic approaches lead to emissive QDs.

Stable Polariton LiDAR,"In the realm of advanced optical systems, particularly within the emerging field of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, which are pivotal for 3D sensing applications across various sectors, a significant commercial challenge emerges from the inherent limitations posed by optical interference in thin-film filters. The core of this challenge lies in the phenomenon known as 'angular dispersion,' a fundamental constraint of interference-based structures in thin-film filter design. Angular dispersion refers to the shift in transmission wavelength of optical filters as the angle of incidence changes, typically resulting in a pronounced blue-shift. This effect, while intrinsic to the operation of optical interference, undermines the performance of LiDAR systems by requiring the filters to have sufficiently broad pass bands to accommodate the angular shift. The SPLiDAR initiative is set to revolutionize the landscape of photonic applications by introducing a groundbreaking approach that transcends the traditional constraints of angular dispersion. This approach harnesses the quantum optical phenomenon of merging light and matter states to create angle-independent transmissive filters, referred to as polariton filters here. This project is poised to redefine of optical filtering and sensing by introducing a novel class of spectrally sharp and angle-independent transmission filters, thereby overcoming the fundamental limitations of angular dispersion in conventional optical devices. The SPLiDAR project will leverage the team's profound expertise in thin-film optics, including transfer matrix and FDTD calculations and structure design optimization, along with a deep understanding of organic absorber properties and a wealth of experience in optoelectronics.",162368,2025,2026,ERC,Germany,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
A new X-ray pulsar navigation system for Deep Space Exploration,"The DeepSpacePULSE project aims at studying the viability of an autonomous Pulsar X-ray Navigation unit that will improve by an order of magnitude almost all aspects of previous similar systems, making these satellite positioning devices competitive in both the public and private space market. Pulsars are astrophysical objects, namely the final result of the supernova explosions of very massive stars. We have detected thus far about three thousand pulsars in our Galaxy, but we know this is only the tip of the iceberg of their entire population. Pulsars are perfect clocks with unprecedented stabilities, making them a perfect GPS system in space. The DeepSpacePULSE Pulsar Navigation System is expected to be an efficient, small and light navigation unit to be mounted in future space missions. This novel navigation technique has been recently tested on the International Space Station, and can be used within our own Solar System (reducing costs with respect to more standard positioning systems), but also for future deep-space navigation. Travelling in deep-space is currently limited by the required power to exchange information with Earth, in particular concerning the satellite positioning system and orbit determination. The first step for a future deep-space exploration, is to develop the technology that will allow any space mission to be able to guide the spacecraft autonomously. DeepSpacePULSE, using this ERC PoC Lump Sum, wants to perform a feasibility study for a new concept of an autonomous X-ray pulsar navigation system expected to weight about 10kg, be as big as a microwave oven, and using a new pulsar observation plan that will possibly permit to keep the satellite autonomous positioning stable for a few centuries.",162368,2025,2026,ERC,Spain,EU,Astronomical Sciences
"Low-noise, rapid and ultrabroadband terahertz time-domain ellipsometry enabled by spintronic terahertz emitters","Electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz (THz) frequency range (0.3-30 THz) is a powerful tool for material spectroscopy and characterization in a contact-free, non-ionizing and non-destructive way. An essential application is the contact-free measurement of the complex-valued reflectivity and, ideally, refractive index of materials. Such knowledge is essential in condensed-matter research (for characterization of, e.g., the conduction-electron concentration and scattering in semiconductors, of optical phonons in insulators and magnons in antiferromagnets) and in applied settings. Ideally, THz reflectivity measurements should be (1) ultrabroadband (covering two decades from 0.3 to 30 THz), (2) user-friendly and offer (3) high precision and low noise. However, requirements (1)-(3) are not fulfilled by current approaches. The goal of T-SPINDEX is to build a prototype THz time-domain reflectivity spectrometer to determine the THz refractive index of materials rapidly. Features (1)-(3) are achieved altogether by using an innovative laser-driven coherent THz source, a spintronic THz emitter.",162368,2024,2025,ERC,Germany,EU,Condensed Matter Physics
Liquid Dosimetry via Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,"The problem: Lack of water-equivalent dosimeters for radiotherapy

Cancer is a global public health problem. Radiotherapy is generally used as an essential method of cancer treatment. Measuring the absorbed dose of radiation to ensure that the radiation delivered to the patient is accurate, is paramount and critical to patient safety, since tumor control and side-effects are highly sensitive to the applied dose. For this purpose, in-vivo dosimetry (IVD) can be performed as a patient-specific measure of quality control and safety during radiotherapy. Clinical experience and dose prescriptions in radiotherapy have historically been based on the absorbed dose to water. However, when a calibrated dosimeter as for today, which is not water equivalent, is used under non-reference conditions, direct determination of the correct absorbed dose to water is not possible and many detectors show an over-response. Water equivalent dosimeters are not available but particularly desirable in clinical applications. 

The solution: A small, water-equivalent, non-toxic and liquid dosimeter with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy readout

This idea presents an innovative strategy for dose determination using a novel type of liquid, water-equivalent and non-toxic dosimeter with readout via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. This novel liquid EPR dosimeter consists of a small (mm-dimensions) capsuled water-based liquid detector material that can be placed on the patient's skin or in body cavities to measure the delivered dose at relevant locations in clinical situations. The principle presented here is based on a dose-dependent EPR signal loss: Stable paramagnetic species dissolved in aqueous solution are transformed into diamagnetic products upon irradiation. The proposed solution is not an incremental improvement of an existing procedure but an innovative approach making IVD easier to use, cheaper, more accurate – and: water equivalent.",162368,2024,2025,ERC,Germany,EU,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Wafer Scale Ultra-Clean Van der Waals Heterostructures,"Two dimensional materials (2DM) and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have opened new opportunities to develop
atomically thin electronic and optoelectronic devices with a wide range of functionalities. While thousands of research papers
demonstrate proof-of-concept studies with improved and novel performance using small-scale exfoliated crystals, a number of
challenges still remains when these are attempted to be scaled up on wafer-scale with CVD grown 2DM. One of the key challenges is
the transfer process of 2DM from their growth substrate to another 2DM or a target substrate for intended use. Currently, this process
is performed using organic polymers to support 2DM, which introduces considerable amount of contamination and mechanical
damage to the transferred layers.
We propose to circumvent the existing issues of the transfer process by employing a new technique recently invented in NGI, which
completely avoids use of organic compounds. This approach enables production of heterostructures with perfect interfaces free from
interlayer contamination and correspondingly excellent (opto)electronic behaviour. In addition, eliminating polymeric supports
allows new possibilities for vdW heterostructure fabrication: assembly at temperatures up to 600°C, and in different environments
including ultra-high vacuum (UHV), liquid submersion and improved mechanical stability.
This project will apply our novel approach for wafer-scale use, considering requirements of industrial companies, such as the choice of
2DMs and wafers, quality standards, throughput and reliability. The improved inorganic transfer technology will be then licensed to a
selected 2DM foundry. In addition, we will develop an instrument for wafer-scale 2DM transfer that employs our innovative approach,
which will be made available via spin-out company. Successful completion of the project can bring life to a wide range of industrial
exploitation of 2DM in industrial nanotechnology applications.",162367,2024,2026,ERC,United Kingdom,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
STrain ENgineered Spatial light mOdulators based on 2D semiconductors,"The main goal of StEnSo is to explore a new concept of spatial light modulators based on strain engineering of two-dimensional semiconducting materials. Spatial light modulators allow for the creation of two-dimensional light patterns and have found many applications in photonics: image projection, holography, aberrations correction, laser surgery, optical tweezers, etc. These devices typically consist of an array of pixels that individually control the phase or amplitude of light passing through it or reflecting off it. In StEnSo I will exploit the large refractive index tunability of 2D semiconducting materials upon mechanical deformation, studied in my ERC StG 2D-TOPSENSE, to fabricate a new concept of spatial light modulator device.",162367,2024,2026,ERC,Spain,EU,Engineering; Quantum Physics
Lattice Boltzmann For Advanced SimulaTions,"The intricate dynamics of fluid interfaces, disordered liquid-liquid emulsions, and soft microfluidic droplet crystals, collectively known
as soft glass materials (SGM), pose challenges to non-equilibrium thermodynamics and hold profound implications for engineering
applications such as combustion, materials design, and food processing. Advances in SGM modeling within the ERC COPMAT project
offer opportunities for innovative mesoscale materials in fields like tissue engineering, photonics, and catalysis.

The Lightweight Lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme, which relies on hydrodynamic moments, models SGM by preventing droplet
coalescence including near-contact interactions (NCI) due to surfactants. Integrated into LBcuda, an open-source software optimized
for GPUs, it efficiently simulates complex flows while saving electrical energy, in line with the goals of the European Green Deal.

The LBFAST project aims to optimize LBcuda's implementation for HPC clusters powered by GPUs, achieving processing rates of
several hundred GLUPS while using only 50% of computational resources, resulting in a 75% reduction in energy costs compared to
standard LB methods. This enhancement enables accelerated production rates for industrial applications and aligns with the criteria

Monolithic Silicon Quantum Communication Circuitry,"The advent of quantum computing and its unprecedented computational power has called the sustainability of today’s widely established encryption methods into question. Even though quantum physics addresses this emerging threat by offering quantum key distribution (QKD) at the same time, the complexity inherent to QKD systems constitutes a roadblock for their practical introduction, especially when addressing telecommunication segments that are subject to commodity-like applications.
MOSQITO is an ERC Proof-of-Concept study that aims to proof the applicability of a novel monolithic silicon integration approach that is touted as a trailblazer to greatly simplify quantum communication circuits while further providing a graceful migration path towards a seamless integration of microelectronics. We will build on a recently demonstrated silicon optical power supply, which enables light emission through a quasi-direct silicon bandgap structure – thus alleviating silicon photonic integrated circuits (PIC) from the burden of complex hetero-integration of III-V materials.
MOSQITO will conduct (i) the world’s first demonstration of a PIC-based QKD transmitter for BB84 polarization-encoded key exchange, where every element has been realized exclusively on a silicon basis, (ii) an evaluation of this greatly simplified QKD hardware for commodity applications such as 6G, residential access, the Industrial Internet or massively-parallel data interconnects – all of them being segments where traditional QKD implementations cannot enter the market due to cost and size concerns, and (iii) strategic clustering activities with silicon platform partners to lay inroads for refining the silicon light emitter with respect to further performance scaling and manufacturing readiness level.",162366,2024,2026,ERC,Austria,EU,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"

2D Materials at the Moiré Scale,"Similar to how large numbers of water molecules can exist as solid, liquid, or gas, strongly correlated electronic phases are emergent phenomena of large numbers of interacting electrons. These phases, such as ""high temperature"" superconductivity, hold exciting potential for technological applications such as creating a scalable quantum computer. Recently discovered ""moiré"" materials, formed by stacking 2D materials with a relative twist, hold unique promise as platforms for investigation of such phases. The investigator is tackling open mathematical problems with direct relevance to understanding the emergence and properties of strongly correlated electronic phases in moiré materials. By tackling these problems, the investigator is helping to advance novel technologies and strengthening connections between mathematics, physics and engineering. The investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics and expanding awareness of exciting modern topics in applied mathematics through outreach to middle and high school students in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. In preliminary work, the investigator justified the Bistritzer-MacDonald continuum PDE model for the wave-function of an electron in twisted bilayer graphene. The importance of this model is that, even though the underlying atomic-scale model is aperiodic, the continuum model has moiré-periodic coefficients, allowing the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene to be studied using Bloch theory. The research project is building on this work, with the ultimate goal of developing mathematical methods for predicting moiré materials' strongly correlated electronic phases. In the near term, the project will build directly on the investigator's preliminary work. First, generalizing it to more realistic models incorporating atomic relaxation, and to models of other moiré materials. Second, analytically investigating important properties of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model such as Dirac point degeneracies and band topology. Over the medium term, the project will build on the insights gained from earlier work to develop and justify more accurate models of mechanical properties of moiré materials such as atomic relaxation and vibration (phonons). Two approaches will be investigated: a phenomenological continuum approach, and an atomic-scale approach where ions interact through interatomic potentials. Over the long term, the project will again build on earlier insights to develop models of electrons interacting in moiré materials. In the first of these, electrons will interact directly through the Coulomb force. In the second, the electron-electron interaction will be mediated by a phonon. Mathematically, the project involves rigorous asymptotic analysis and perturbation theory, PDE theory, spectral theory, calculus of variations, and ergodic theory. The project draws new connections between these areas and the application area in materials science. The research will develop these areas by introducing new problems and insights. While accomplishing the research goals of the project, the investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics. The investigator is also expanding awareness of exciting modern topics in applied mathematics through outreach to middle and high school students in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, especially through the University of Minnesota's UMTYMP program.

Collaborative Research: Development and Characterization of AlGaAs Coatings for Gravitational-wave Detectors,"The goal of NSF's LIGO gravitational wave detectors is to explore the Universe by observing the astronomical gravitational waves that were first described by Einstein over a century ago. LIGO is currently observing a gravitational wave event about once every two weeks. This award is to develop improved mirrors for the laser-based detector that will allow more observations of gravitational waves, both more frequently and from astronomical sources that are rarer and/or farther away. Gravitational wave observations will help us better understand the universe, and specifically current mysteries including the source of dark matter, the nature of dark energy and the expansion of the Universe, and whether Einstein’s description of gravity continues to work at very high strengths like immediately around a black hole. Developing better mirrors for LIGO will also advance the technology used for mirrors in related precision timing technologies and lasers. This can help with a number of precision measurement techniques useful in many fields and applications. The PIs will train students in STEAM research areas. This award is part of the effort to reduce coating thermal noise, the limitation to LIGO’s sensitivity which dominates the lowest noise mid-frequency band. For LIGO's A# upgrade and the future Cosmic Explorer detector crystalline GaAs/AlGaAs coatings are being developed because they have the best thermal noise properties known and have optical properties commensurate with the best current coatings. With AlGaAs coatings the predicted event rate for LIGO A# will increase by 3-4 times over the previous A+ upgrade. This contrasts with 1.5-2 times the event rate increase expected with ion beam-deposited amorphous oxide coatings. Such improved sensitivity will deliver a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 200 for binary black hole sources like GW150914 and more than 300 for binary neutron star sources like GW170817. This will allow for better determinations of black hole spin, better tests of alternative theories of gravity, improvement in our knowledge of the nuclear equation of state from neutron star mergers, and a better explanation of objects in the mass gap between black holes and neutron stars.

"Variational Problems and Patterns in Materials Science: Martensitic Phase Transitions, Superconductivity and Porous Media","Singularly perturbed variational problems in materials science have attracted significant attention in both mathematical and materials science communities. Crumples in a sheet of paper, wrinkles in curtains, defects in liquid crystals or superconductors share at least one thing in common - they are the results of a certain energy minimization. Hence, this project is aimed at creating novel energy minimizing models, in particular, in metallic alloys, which would be capable of capturing and explaining certain experimentally observable effects. The investigator is developing new mathematical techniques that address the mechanism behind the optimality of these models. Furthermore, these techniques have the potential to be used in other areas of materials science, such as the location of defects in superconductors or the analysis of random porous media, which are also addressed in the project. The project has both scientific and educational components. The importance of this work is not only that it introduces novel variational problems in materials science and develops new methods to analyze them, but it also advances the discovery and understanding of new phenomena and contributes to the development of new materials, such as shape memory alloys. The educational component of the project involves development of special topics courses at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) as well as mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. As a part of this project, an applied mathematics seminar series is being held at VCU by bringing national and international experts to interact with faculty and students. The common aim of the project is understanding the structures, formed in a variety of physical systems of practical interest. The first part of the project is devoted to the patterns in martensitic phase transitions, or thermal material transformations, leading to shape memory effect. The investigator is obtaining a theoretical insight on certain experimentally observed phenomena in shape memory alloys, induced by bending and described in the physical literature. The investigator also addresses the effects of anisotropy and develops a novel approach to show that the experimentally observed patterns are energy minimizing. The second part of the project deals with the patterns in the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity. The investigator considers the variational problem, related to the minimization of Ginzburg-Landau functional with certain (semi-stiff) boundary conditions, and shows that this problem has solutions with defects (vortices) near the domain boundary. The technique of matching upper and lower bounds is used to predict the precise location of these defects. Finally, the third part of the project deals with optimal control problems for porous media equations with stochastic forcing. Optimal control problems have a vast range of applications, ranging from economics to engineering. In this project the investigator considers the porous medium equation, subject to additional stochastic influence, and extends the classic techniques of homogenization theory to the stochastically perturbed optimal control case.

Angular momentum predictions for low-energy induced fission,"Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into two or more fragments, plays an essential role in both applied and fundamental science. However, even 85 years after its discovery, it remains a challenging puzzle for nuclear theorists. A crucial piece of this puzzle is the angular momentum of fission fragments, a measure of fragments' rotation that has a substantial impact on the emission of neutrons and photons during the deexcitation process. Recent research on the subject has reignited a long-standing debate on several fundamental questions. One key problem involves establishing a comprehensive microscopic theory of angular momentum distributions for the full range of fragments' masses and charges. These distributions are a major input in the data evaluation process employed to generate the large nuclear data libraries used in fundamental science and nuclear technology. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive theory, those evaluations still rely on simplified and occasionally inaccurate phenomenological inputs. The principal aim of this project is to predict angular momentum distributions using state-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory. Combining symmetry-restoration techniques and the time-dependent generator coordinate method, we will compute angular momentum distributions in fragments for the neutron-induced fission of two crucial actinides, 239Pu and 235U. Subsequently, we will explore the impact of nuclear excitation on these distributions by extending the finite-temperature formalism to fission fragments. The resulting database, first of its kind, will encompass microscopic angular momentum distributions as functions of the incident neutron energy and the nuclear excitation energy. Finally, we will evaluate the influence of these distributions on predicted fission spectra, employing the Hauser-Feschbach simulator YAHFC, thus paving the way for fission modeling based on microscopic theory.",158092,2024,2026,European Commission,Croatia,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
2D Nano Hybrid Systems: interfacing biomolecular motors with nanopores in 2D materials,"Interfacing the solid-state electronics with biological systems has been a long-standing challenge in nanobiotechnology. Creating nanobio hybrids would enable harnessing the remarkable capabilities offered by solid-state materials and biological molecules, such as proteins, enzymes, DNA etc., at the same time. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are among the most prospective building blocks for future-generation electronic and biosensing devices due to their exceptional optoelectronic and mechanical properties combined with their atomic thickness. Their ultimate thinness has been considered as a remarkable advantage for nanopore-based sensing, and they have been widely investigated as 2D solid-state nanopore platforms for single-molecule sensing. The goal of this proposal is to push further the development of 2D nanopores by developing new protocols for creating interfaces between 2D materials and biomolecular motors. Attaching the enzyme motor, such as DNA helicase, to a nanopore made in 2D material would introduce an active control in nanofluidic transport of single-molecules and ions. Such hybrid platforms presents a step forward in uniting biological inspiration and nanoscale engineering, offering unprecedented levels of control, precision, and versatility at the nanoscale.

Development of Efficient Black Hole Spectroscopy and a Desktop Cluster for Detecting Compact Binary Mergers,"This award supports two projects. The first is to develop methods for testing Einstein's theory of relativity in one of the most extreme environments in the universe: near the horizon of a black hole. Einstein's theory predicts that gravitational waves emitted by black holes should consist of specific frequencies, similar to how a chorus consists of multiple singers signing at different pitches. Gravitational waves are detectable here on Earth with NSF's LIGO detector. This project will use LIGO data to determine if the chorus of gravitational waves emitted by a black hole is exactly as Einstein predicted, or if the black hole ""sings"" an unexpected tune. Such tests may lead to new discoveries in physics, giving us a better understanding of the fundamental workings of the universe. The second component is to develop a network of Apple Silicon computers to search for new gravitational-waves in LIGO data. Such a network has the potential to make searching for new signals substantially faster and at very low cost. This will make it easier for lesser-resourced universities and undergraduate-focused colleges to directly contribute to gravitational-wave astronomy, broadening the appeal and access to fundamental STEM research in the US. The award provides support for students, who will gain widely-applicable data science skills that are of great national need. This award supports the development of an open-source, Python-based transdimensional Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampler that will naturally identify the set of observable quasi-normal modes emitted by a black hole that is formed in binary black hole mergers. This will be applied to new gravitational-wave detections. Key science questions to be addressed include: are overtones of the dominant mode observable at merger, and if so, which ones? Are other sub-dominant modes observable? If more than one mode is observable, are they consistent with general relativity? In order to answer such questions (and to do any science with gravitational waves), candidate signals must first be identified. Currently this is done by performing a matched-filter search using large numbers of CPUs on data-center clusters. Previous efforts to utilize GPUs have been hampered by the need to transfer data between the CPU and GPU. New ""Systems on a Chip"" (SoC) such as the Apple Silicon processors side-step this issue, as memory is shared between the CPU and GPU cores. This award will fund the construction, software development, and testing of a cluster of SoC processors. The goal is to perform searches significantly faster and for much lower cost than what is currently done.

Geometric Representation Theory of Quantum Groups and 3d Mirror Symmetry,"From its earliest days in the ’80s, the theory of quantum groups has proven to be an extremely fruitful research field, deeply connected with statistical mechanics, conformal field theory, and low dimensional topology. In the last decade, new revolutionary ideas have reshaped the theory of quantum groups by revealing its interplay with two other fundamental areas of modern mathematics: moduli theory and enumerative geometry. The research direction initiated by Maulik and Okounkov has shown that quantum groups arise naturally as symmetry algebras governing the enumerative geometry of certain moduli spaces deeply connected with physics, including the famous Nakajima quiver varieties. This breakthrough has made it possible to define quantum groups for arbitrary quivers and has outstanding applications to difference equations and the mathematical study of 3d mirror symmetry. On the other hand, Kontsevich and Soibelman showed that another quantum group-like object could be associated with a quiver Q: the cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra of Q. This is a particular incarnation of a larger class of algebras defined by the same authors in connection to DT theory, and shares many features with the Maulik-Okounkov quantum group. Conjecturally, these two geometric approaches to the theory of quantum groups are equivalent, but at present, only partial confirmations have been found.The applicant plans to develop a new theory bridging the gap between these two realizations of quantum groups and explore its algebraic and geometric consequences. He proposes a new approach to this problem based on the interplay between the stable envelopes of Nakajima varieties, which are the fundamental gadgets of Maulik-Okounkov theory, and Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHAs. Remarkably, these ideas also apply to K-theory and the elusive elliptic cohomology, where the theory of quantum groups still conceals many mysteries, and have interesting applications to difference equations.The elliptic generalization will also open the way to investigate one of the main conjectures in the context of 3d mirror symmetry, namely, 3d mirror symmetry of stable envelopes. This conjecture, motivated by certain dualities observed in 3d gauge theory, anticipates an identification between the stable envelopes of different- looking pairs of symplectic varieties and has important consequences in enumerative geometry and integrable systems. Building on his proof of mirror symmetry of stable envelopes for Cherkis bow varieties (joint work with R. Rimányi), the applicant plans to introduce new versions of CoHAs controlling the behavior of the stable envelopes of mirror dual pairs and to study 3d mirror symmetry in more general settings, including affine bow varieties and slices in affine Grassmannians. Algebraic applications to quantum Shur-Weyl duality, the dynamical Weyl group, and bi-spectral dualities are also proposed.",155227,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Advances in rational operations in free analysis,"The order of actions or operations typically matters; for example, one should first wash the clothes and then dry them, not the other way around. In other words, operations typically do not commute; this is why matrices, which encode noncommutativity in mathematics, are omnipresent in science. While matrix and operator theory has been profoundly developed in the past, the fast-evolving technological advances raise new challenges that have to be addressed. Concretely, expanding quantum technologies, complex control systems, and new resources in optimization and computability pose questions about ensembles of matrices and their features that are independent of the matrix size. The common framework for studying such problems is provided by free analysis (""free"" as in size-free), which investigates functions in matrix and operator variables. This project focuses on such functions that are built only using variables and arithmetic operations, and are therefore called noncommutative polynomials and rational functions. While these are more tangible and computationally accessible than general noncommutative functions, most of their fundamental features are yet to be explored. The scope of the project is to investigate noncommutative rational functions and their variations, develop a theory that allows resolving open problems about them, and finally apply these resolutions to tackle emerging challenges in optimization, control systems, and quantum information. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. The scope of this project is twofold. Firstly, the project aims to answer several function-theoretic open problems on rational operations in noncommuting variables. Among these are singularities and vanishing of rational expressions in bounded operator variables, geometric and structural detection of composition in noncommutative rational functions using control-theoretic tools, noncommutative tensor-rational functions and their role in computational complexity, and existence of low-rank values of noncommutative polynomials with a view towards noncommutative algebraic geometry and approximate zero sets. These fundamental problems call for new synergistic methods that combine complex analysis, representation theory, algebraic geometry and operator theory. Secondly, the project aims to advance the framework of positivity and optimization in several operator variables without dimension restrictions, where the objective functions and constraints are noncommutative polynomials and their variations. The approach to this goal leads through functional analysis, real algebraic geometry and operator algebras. Moreover, the project seeks to apply these new optimization algorithms in quantum information theory, to study nonlinear Bell inequalities in complex quantum networks and the self-testing phenomenon in device-independent certification and cryptographic security.

Collaborative Research: RUI: The disintegration of clusters and their contribution to the metal-poor bulge,"Globular clusters are spherical groups of thousands of stars, bound together by gravity. The clusters contain some of the first stars formed in the Galaxy. As a globular cluster moves through space, it will fall toward the center of the Galaxy. Stars will become disrupted and some stars will leave the cluster and become part of the Milky Way. The team of investigators are from four primarily undergraduate universities. They seek to confirm which stars came from clusters by spectroscopically measuring the abundances of elements in stars that are moving in the same directions in the Milky Way. The stars with similar composition are likely members of the same original cluster. The location of stripped cluster stars depends on the mass distribution of the Galaxy. In this way, the Galaxy’s gravitational potential can be probed. During the course of the research, the team will publish their successes in student research projects and share opportunities with other faculty at small Universities. The team hopes to attract other researchers to pursue similar, cutting-edge projects. Each of the team members will also fund undergraduate students in this research, involving students from minority serving institutions. The researchers will obtain new, detailed observations of 3000 stars. These will be carefully selected as candidate globular cluster tidal debris or members of eroded low-luminosity globular clusters. Measuring the radial velocities and metallicities will give a probability for these stars having originated from a globular cluster. In this way, the team can establish a connection between the stars in the inner Galaxy and those that have been stripped from clusters. The location of stripped stars gives direct insight into the fraction of globular clusters that have contributed to the bulge field. Stripped globular cluster stars further allow the initial properties of the early globular clusters to be probed. Identifying stars from globular cluster stars that are now part of the inner Galaxy is essential for understanding the assembly history of the Milky Way.

Frequency-Tunable Optomechanical Transducer,"Optically linking quantum systems enables distributed quantum computation, remote sensing and long-distance quantum communication. Superconducting microwave qubits are a promising technology platform for future quantum computing and sensors, having demonstrated fast controllability and significant industry investment. However, these machines lack an optical interface, necessary to connect remote devices. Piezo opto-mechanical crystals (OMC) have shown remarkable success in creating microwave-optical entanglement, a key resource for sharing entanglement between two quantum computing units. However, the lack of uniformity in emission wavelength across different piezo OMC devices prevents a straight-forward expansion to two or more network nodes.We address this challenge by focusing on post-fabrication tuning of piezo OMCs. This will enable us to create compatible devices to create entanglement within a network.At the same time, we are investigating the optimal infrastructure to implement entanglement distribution based on this technology by exploring the operating parameter of these systems.",151760,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,United States,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Symbolic artificial intelligence for hidden topological orders in quantum physics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) offers novel methodologies to unravel complex physical phenomena. However, most machine learning models lack transparency in their decision-making processes. In this proposal, we aim to develop a symbolic AI as a tool to reveal hidden topological orders in quantum physics. To this end, an AI-assisted symbolic regression method will be studied. We focus on three main objectives: (i) machine learning topological phases with experimental data; (ii) uncovering hidden non-local symmetry-protected topological orders; and (iii) searching for quantized topological invariants in an unsupervised fashion. The interplay between symbolic AI and quantum physics is envisioned to bring new insights into topological phases. Moreover, the project will scrutinize the explainability and the robustness of machine learning models. The investigations will provide concrete guidelines for accompanying theoretical and experimental studies at MagTop. The outcomes of the project will pave the way to discover novel features of topological materials in a reliable and explainable way, as well as provide great opportunities for me to reach a position of professional excellence and independence.",151488,2024,2026,European Commission,Poland,EU,Quantum Physics
innovative STructures for improvEd Light colLection in ARgon-based TPCs,"STELLAR (innovative STructures for improvEd Light colLection in ARgon-based TPCs) goal is to boost the advancement of noble gas and liquid optical Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detectors for rare-event searches, with Dark Matter (DM) being one of the most compelling puzzles of todays fundamental physics. STELLAR plans to contribute to the development of novel amplification structures based on Micropattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) technology incorporating wavelength-shifting materials, capable of providing improved light collection and greater operating stability at higher gains. STELLAR programme can further contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanisms of signal formation in TPCs, opening the possibility of studying the electron extraction efficiency and electroluminescence in electronegative gas mixtures. This is a specially relevant topic considering the recent technological developments observed in DM searches with the use of Negative Ion TPCs, eventually optically readout. It is anticipated that the floating wavelength-shifting Field-Assisted Gas Electron Multipliers (FAT-GEM) mechanical characteristics and performance, can be a valuable alternative to current amplification structures used in noble-element TPCs for DM searches, for instance DarkSide-LowMass, or currently planned for long baseline neutrino experiment DUNE.",151486,2024,2026,European Commission,Poland,EU,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
"Intersections of Cosmology, Condensed Matter and Quantum Information","This award funds the research activities of Professor Daniel Boyanovsky at the University of Pittsburgh. Observations over the last two decades have unambiguously determined that 95% of the energy and matter content of our Universe is in the form of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, both of which require new theoretical frameworks for their understanding. The Standard Model of Particle Physics describes the fundamental particles and their interactions and has been experimentally confirmed to great accuracy with current accelerators, with the discovery in 2012 of the Higgs particle. Despite its successes the Standard Model does not explain either Dark Matter or Dark Energy. However, compelling extensions beyond it provide tantalizing hints for the possible explanation of Dark Matter in the form of a new particle, the axion, which, if it exists, also provides a possible explanation of aspects of the strong interactions. Under this grant award, Professor Boyanovsky, in collaboration with students will pursue research on fundamental non-equilibrium aspects of this Dark Matter candidate to complement current experimental searches for its existence. Recently it has been proposed that a similar type of particle may exist in novel materials, thus the study of its properties and observational avenues is truly interdisciplinary and promotes the progress of science in many ways. The project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts across disciplines. Professor Boyanovsky will involve graduate students in the research program, thereby providing critical training for junior physicists and a broad and enriching educational experience. The results will be disseminated via public lectures and shared openly with the community. More technically, Professor Boyanovsky and students will implement non-equilibrium effective field theory and quantum master equation methods borrowed from quantum information and other branches of physics, to study the production, decay and thermalization of Dark Matter candidates during the Early Universe determining its abundance, and to explore the tantalizing possibility of realizing these particles in novel materials which may provide platforms for quantum information. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",150000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
RUI: Advancing the Constructive Standard Model: Efficient Techniques for High-Multiplicity Amplitude Calculations,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Neil Christensen at Illinois State University. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), protons are accelerated to near-light speeds and smashed together to potentially create new massive particles that have never been seen before. These particles could reveal new fundamental laws that govern the universe. However, these rare events occur in less than 1 in ten million million collisions, necessitating ultra-precise calculations that would allow us to identify new physics signals amid the mountain of background noise. As part of his research, Professor Christensen will perform such calculations. The new calculational methods developed in this research will advance the national interest by significantly increasing the efficiency and accuracy of these background calculations. This improvement will allow scientists to use data from the LHC more effectively in order to discover new physics that was previously out of reach. Additionally, this research keeps the United States at the forefront of theoretical progress, deepening our understanding of the fundamental particles, fields, and laws that govern the universe. This project also supports education and diversity by training the next generation of physicists in cutting-edge techniques. At a more technical level, this project extends the development of a “constructive” technique for calculating scattering amplitudes, potentially replacing Feynman diagrams. Constructive amplitudes eliminate the unphysical degrees of freedom present in Feynman diagrams, ensuring trivial gauge invariance without the need for a gauge symmetry to cancel unphysical effects. Consequently, every diagram is physically meaningful, and the expressions are typically more compact and numerically efficient. However, the interactions are non-local, and on-shell identities must be used at intermediate stages to obtain correct results. This method is still relatively new for massive theories such as the Standard Model, and this research actively extends it to uncalculated amplitudes, higher multiplicity final states, and higher loops. As we develop this technique, we aim to create a comprehensive algorithm that can be faithfully followed and integrated into computational tools in order to automate these calculations. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",150000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Fundamental Physics","This award funds the research activities of Professor Paolo Gondolo at the University of Utah. Dark matter and dark energy are two of the most intriguing and mysterious components of our universe. Dark matter is an unseen substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, yet it exerts a gravitational force, helping to hold galaxies together. Dark energy is an unknown form of energy that is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. Understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy is crucial because they make up about 25% and 70% of the universe's total mass-energy content, respectively. Unraveling their secrets could fundamentally change our comprehension of the cosmos and the laws that govern it. Thus research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. In his research, Professor Gondolo will develop innovative methods to investigate the nature of dark matter and dark energy in areas that have been hitherto only slightly explored, such as newly proposed forms of dark matter (e.g., molecular dark matter), the possibility of trapping dark energy, and of using rotating particles to probe gravity theories. This project also envisions to have significant broader impacts. Professor Gondolo will involve undergraduate students in his research, thereby providing critical opportunities for a next generation of physicists. Professor Gondolo will also lead a science outreach program for K-12 students and their families. More technically, Professor Gondolo will (a) explore theoretical explanations for the dark matter in the Universe based on particle physics beyond the Standard Model, including strategies to eventually measure astrophysical properties of particle dark matter; (b) make progress toward an understanding of dark energy by studying compact objects with vacuum interior, including their possible observational signatures and models for their formation and rotation; and (c) test aspects of gravity, like its coupling to spin, by exploiting the precision of modern gravitational measurements of the motion of matter in strong gravitational fields.

Building Trust in Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Inference - Modelling Uncertainties and Tests of General Relativity,"This project is jointly funded by the Gravitational Physics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). With the advent of Gravitational Wave astronomy in the last decade, a new means of observing the most extreme processes in the Universe has appeared. From a century of detailed studies into General Relativity as the preferred theory of gravitation, predictive models for what gravitational waves might be observable have been readily available for use in analyses capable of inferring the astrophysical properties of the observed systems, which so far primarily have been binary systems of black holes and/or neutron stars. While these gravitational wave models are accurate enough to not introduce systematic biases in observations made with current observatories, as those observatories improve in sensitivity these models have been shown to fail in recovering the unbiased astrophysics governing the observed gravitational waves. Additionally, if it turns out that General Relativity itself is not the final theory of gravitation, any actual observable deviation away from General Relativity could easily be masked by such a systematic model bias. Being able to both describe and account for model inaccuracies will increase the trustworthiness in both current and future astrophysical gravitational wave observations as well as enable new and robust studies into the validity of theories beyond General Relativity. A major goal of this award is the training of of students in analysis, astrophysics, and project management skills necessary to complete their respective projects, while also immersing them in a collaborative research environment at the leading edge of gravitational-wave science. This award will also focus on increasing the involvement and retention of STEM (focusing on gravitational astrophysics) students from communities local to UNLV that have traditionally been under-represented. This will be achieved by creating a set of bridge programs, to increase the fraction of STEM students from under-represented minorities at the graduate level to match the fraction of undergraduate students from those groups. This award supports the development, testing, and implementation of a set of analyses incorporating Bayesian inference to estimate the astrophysical source parameters of compact-object binary coalescences as observed using gravitational waves. These developments will focus on incorporating the capability of accounting for and mitigating uncertainties, inaccuracies, and biases inherent to the assumed gravitational wave signal models, with the explicit goal of increasing the robustness and trustworthiness of the inferred astrophysics. With a more robust understanding of the overall astrophysical analysis, described through General Relativity, it will also be possible to search for beyond-General Relativity signatures. Inferring compact-object binary source parameters is one of the cornerstones of modern gravitational-wave astrophysics, a set of analyses on which nearly all astrophysical statements derived from gravitational-wave observations are based. Hence, as the sensitivity of the current (and future) gravitational-wave detectors increases, the requirements for the fidelity of the models used in the analyses will increase significantly. The combination of methodology and astrophysical deliverables within this award will provide both the necessary breadth and depth necessary for preparing gravitational-wave research for the exciting future to come.

Advancing Multi-Messenger Astrophysics with Gravitational-Wave Observations,"This award supports the ""New Messengers and New Physics"" initiative, identified as a priority area by the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020. Gravitational waves, the latest breakthrough in physics, have become accessible for study through NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Since the landmark detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger, the LIGO and Virgo detectors have observed hundreds of compact binary coalescences including binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star black holes. These observations facilitate extensive research, advancing our knowledge in fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. This award will advance multi-messenger astrophysics by increasing the number of joint observations and enhancing methods for joint analysis of gravitational wave and electromagnetic data, potentially leading to the next significant breakthrough in the field. The award will support summer undergraduate research fellows through Georgia Tech's NSF REU program and, in collaboration with other astrophysics faculty, develop an astrophysics curriculum for the Vertically Integrated Project, a program that provides opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research activities as part of a team. Additionally, the PI will organize astrophysics booths at the annual Atlanta Science Festival to engage the community with the latest findings and the excitement of gravitational-wave astronomy. Multi-messenger observations of compact binary mergers can significantly enhance our understanding of neutron star matter, and the physics of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae, and serve as a tool for measuring the Universe's expansion and testing general relativity. Facilitating these observations and conducting low-latency analyses are top priorities as outlined in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observational Science and Operations White Papers and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration Program. This project focuses on the crucial tasks needed to achieve these high-priority goals. Studies indicate that during the fifth observing run, with the A+ upgrades to the LIGO detectors scheduled to commence before the project's end, LIGO will likely detect several tens of binary neutron stars and neutron star–black holes annually, with a few detectable before they merge. With the current and forthcoming wide-field transient facilities, it will be possible to promptly observe these events electromagnetically. This award is vital to fully leverage the scientific potential of already funded observatories.

LIGO Detector Characterization and Supernova Data Analysis,"LIGO and its sibling collaborations continue to push forward the young field of gravitational wave astronomy in the fourth observing run and beyond. This grant focuses on Embry-Riddle's continued contributions to two facets of LIGO science. The first is detector characterization, which involves efforts to understand and mitigate the effects of Earth-based noise on the interferometer in order to detect gravitational waves with better clarity. Detector characterization efforts involve both near-real time analysis of data enabling time-sensitive follow-ups of signals with optical telescopes and mitigation of noise in archival searches on longer timescales. The second is the search for gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae, a promising source of gravitational wave emission beyond binary coalescences. Embry-Riddle is well positioned to advance the training of the next generation of scientists due to its focus on undergraduate education with close faculty-student interaction. Embry-Riddle's location, serving rural north-central Arizona and in close proximity to the Navajo nation, helps attract first-generation college students. The search for gravitational waves is complicated by the presence of terrestrial background, resulting from environmental disturbances and behavior of the interferometers themselves. Understanding these disturbances and removing them from interferometric data through detector characterization activities is critical in conducting sensitive searches for gravitational waves. The PI recently completed his term as a co-chair of LIGO's detector characterization group, and continues to contribute to that group's noise mitigation efforts, including vetting potential events in near real-time as a member of the rapid response team enabling multimessenger follow-ups of gravitational wave signals. Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are an exciting target for multi-messenger astronomy. Given the rate of about two CCSNe per century in our galaxy, the signatures of the next Galactic CCSN are already traveling toward us. The reconstruction of a gravitational wave from a CCSN would address a number of open questions in astrophysics, including the mechanism of the explosion itself as well as fundamental questions about neutrino interactions and the neutron star equation of state. In the next few years, the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO combined with more sophisticated algorithms for detection and parameter estimation of supernova signals will greatly enhance LIGO's opportunities for exploring supernova astrophysics.

Gravitational Radiation From Compact Objects Using Computational Astrophysics,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics. A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. The main impact of the work will be in gravitational wave astrophysics. The award will increase our understanding of gravitational wave signatures from the inspiral and collision of two neutron stars. The research also impacts broader areas of computational science. The computational techniques developed by the investigators can be used to solve problems in other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, and seismology. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand in academia, national laboratories, and industry. Relativity, black holes, and neutron stars continue to fascinate the public and allow science to be communicated broadly. The investigators upload movies to YouTube for public viewing and regularly give outreach talks about their work and other interesting scientific events. This award will support the study of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers. The research is aimed at solving Einstein’s equations numerically using simulations run on NSF-funded supercomputers. One of the major goals is to accurately track the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star systems, particularly focusing on the gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral just before the stars collide. All resulting research will be publicly available.

Topics in Physics Beyond the Standard Model,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Christopher Carone at William & Mary. The standard model of particle physics is a theory that provides an extremely successful description of the known elementary particles and their interactions. However, the standard model also leads to mysteries that currently remain unresolved and are likely related to physics at extremely small distance scales. Professor Carone will explore a range of novel possibilities for the particle physics in this regime. These may address a number of mysteries, such as why there are stable hierarchies between the widely different energies and distance scales found in nature, why the masses of known elementary particles have the inexplicable range of values that are observed, and whether the ultimate theory describing elementary particles may be of a special type that can be extrapolated sensibly to distances that are infinitely small. Such investigations advance the national interest by furthering the progress of science in the US via our understanding of the basic building blocks of the universe. Professor Carone will work with doctoral students on the project, providing them with training that will equip them to be valuable additions to either the academic or the broader STEM workforce. Professor Carone will also participate in outreach events that enrich high school teachers by giving them an awareness and exposure to particle physics research. More technically, Professor Carone will study novel higher-derivative quantum field theories that interpolate between Lee-Wick and nonlocal theories and that provide a new solution to the hierarchy problem. He will construct new models of elementary fermion masses that involve modular flavor symmetries, a possibility that is motivated by string theory. He will consider the constraints on well-motivated gauge extensions of the standard model that follow from asymptotic safety, the condition that couplings flow to nontrivial fixed points in the ultraviolet. He will also follow up on his recent work on regular black hole metrics, to understand a variety of astrophysical consequences that follow from the assumed nontrivial mass dependence of the regulator.

Active Violin Mode Dampers for Gravitational-Wave Detector Suspension Fibers,"The groundbreaking discovery by the NSF’s Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) provided a first glimpse of the profound potential that the rapidly growing field of Gravitational-Wave Astrophysics holds for the rest of the century. This year, advanced LIGO reached its design sensitivity of 160+ Mpc, resulting in multiple observed black hole mergers per week. Reducing the time the LIGO detectors must spend acquiring an observation-ready state directly translates to additional observation time and astrophysical detections. This award supports the development of a sensor and actuator subsystem that will improve the duty cycle and sensitivity of LIGO detectors by mitigating the suspension resonant modes. The award will also support graduate students working on gravitational-wave detector instrumentation. The violin modes of the LIGO test mass suspensions cause operational issues when they are excited and limit the detector sensitivity in the narrow bands of their resonances. The modes can be excited by external events like earthquakes and can prolong interferometer downtime after lock losses. This award will support the design, construction, and characterization of an active suspension fiber damping system suitable for LIGO and future ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. A dedicated shadow sensor for measuring fiber displacement and an accompanying electrostatic actuator will be prototyped and developed at Syracuse University. In parallel, a compact sensor and actuator will be developed for integration into the test mass fiber guards. This project will also inform the suspension design for future gravitational-wave detectors. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",150000,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Astronomical Sciences
Advanced Interferometer Control in the Presence of Radiation Pressure,"Gravitational waves from binary black holes and neutron star mergers are being detected at an unprecedented rate. Gravitational wave observatories such as the Advanced LIGO detectors in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana continue to grow in sensitivity to signals from astrophysical origin by reducing noise to their fundamental limits. These detectors rely upon the ability to make heavy mirrors absolutely still, so when a very small gravitational wave passes through the detector, the extremely small relative motion imparted onto the mirrors by the gravitational wave is detectable. Current limitations to the sensitivity to gravitational waves depend significantly on the mass of the mirrors, including quantum radiation pressure noise and noise from the detector controllers pushing on the mirrors. One simple way to increase sensitivity to gravitational waves is to increase the mass of the mirrors. The team will train students in STEM research areas. This award supports the design of a LIGO upgrade to increase suspended test masses from 40 kg to 100 kg. In particular, the PI's team will contribute to the design of the enhanced actuation and calibration systems to accommodate the increased mass of the mirrors while taking full advantage of the sensitivity increases. This work will investigate the performance of the current 40 kg test mass suspensions, both in low-noise and lock acquisition configurations, which will inform simulations and designs of the 100 kg suspensions. The group will also investigate the feasibility of novel actuation schemes, including the possibility of remote test mass control using a high-power auxiliary laser upgrade to the photon calibrator, known as the photon actuator.

Embedding Calculus and its Applications,"This project concerns spaces of embeddings, generalizing the question of whether a circle embedded in three dimensional space can be untangled to the question of whether an n-parameter family of embeddings (possibly in high dimensions) can be deformed to a constant family. The PI will study far-reaching extensions of the linking number of a pair of curves in 3-space in novel ways. This project will improve our understanding of embedded objects and their relatives, both for their intrinsic mathematical interest and for their myriad applications in algebra, geometry, and physics. The PI will also work toward broadening participation in mathematics at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and in the wider region through minority recruitment efforts, national and university-wide initiatives, and undergraduate research mentorship. The main technical tool pervading this project is the functor calculus of Goodwillie and Weiss, especially the variant known as embedding calculus. The embedding calculus will often serve as an organizational principle, with configuration spaces playing a key role in concrete implementations of it. The PI will use this method to study the algebraic topology of spaces of embeddings and spaces of diffeomorphisms of manifolds of various dimensions, including their integer-valued and torsion invariants. Related directions to be explored include the rigid geometry of embeddings; expansions and finite-type invariants of groups; and computational and probabilistic approaches to various linking phenomena. This project is jointly funded by the NSF-DMS Topology and Geometric Analysis Program (TGA) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Gibbsian line ensembles, vertex models, and geometric aspects of stochastic growth","This project studies stochastic growth models, which are mathematical idealizations of the evolution of 1-dimensional interfaces between two media, such as the boundary of a cell colony, the frontier of a forest fire, or the boundary between the wet and dry portions of a piece of paper after water is dripped on it. In the past decade mathematical structures called line ensembles have played a prominent role in the understanding of stochastic growth models. Line ensembles also show up in modeling seemingly unrelated areas, such as magnetization, traffic, and protein synthesis in cells. This project will expand knowledge of line ensembles and related techniques, which will lead to the solution of previously intractable problems. The project will also incorporate organization of conferences and seminars, mentoring of graduate students, outreach to middle school students, and expository writing. The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), last passage percolation and polymer models, the stochastic six vertex (S6V) model, the parabolic Airy line ensemble, and the directed landscape are a few central models and objects in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, and they share a common feature of bearing connections to line ensembles. This project will exploit and in some cases develop these connections to explore a number of directions: (i) the limiting statistics of models including the S6V model, ASEP, higher spin colored vertex models, and their degenerations, (ii) the upper and lower tail behavior of KPZ models and the relationship of the line ensembles with random geometry, and (iii) questions in more classical areas of probability such as mixing times (of polymer models) and interfaces in the Ising model.

Atmospheric characterisation of hot rocky super-Earths in the era of JWST,"Super-Earths are a class of exoplanets with sizes bigger than the Earth and smaller than Neptune. These planets are common in our galaxy and yet there are no analogues in our Solar system. The properties, and even existence, of an atmosphere in close-in strongly irradiated super-Earths have been of interest over the past years, remaining mostly unconstrained. For instance, tidally-locked rocky planets orbiting close to their host star might have a day-side hemisphere partially or fully molten, producing an atmosphere of rock or silicate vapour. In the dawn of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we are finally able to tackle this subject in depth, as precise spectroscopic observations can reveal more details about exoplanet atmospheres than any previous space-based telescope. However, the first results by JWST exposed the need for developing sophisticated methods to analyse data, as slight differences in the data reduction can lead to vastly different interpretations in the characterisation of exoplanets. During my PhD, I investigated the processes occurring on the iconic super-Earth 55 Cnc e using ultra-precise photometric observations.     The aim of my proposed SNF Postdoc.Mobility fellowship is to characterise the atmospheres of hot rocky super-Earths. In the current era of unprecedented observing precision, this project seeks to learn about the composition and climate of hot rocky worlds. I will achieve this by implementing a robust statistical method in the analysis of spectroscopic observations in both transmission and emission, allowing us to confidently detect atmospheric features of distant worlds.     In the first phase of the research project I will apply statistical methods in a Bayesian framework to mitigate correlated noise, improving data processing, reduction and analysis. For this I will use current space-based observations of JWST and ESA’s CHEOPS to test the method. In particular, I will perform multiple data reductions and implement hierarchical models to combine the different reductions to deal with the estimates properly. In the second phase I will apply the framework to JWST observations of hot rocky super-Earths and characterise their atmospheres using transmission and emission spectroscopy. By undertaking this project at Oxford, I will be able to work with experts on statistical methods and atmospheres in a stimulating environment for exoplanet science.     In the short term, the proposed project will deepen our observational understanding of atmospheres in hot super-Earths and how these inform us about their interior and composition. The methods implemented will improve our best practices when reducing and analysing cutting-edge astronomical observations with JWST and CHEOPS and pave the way for future missions such as ARIEL, PLATO and ELT, having an important impact on the exoplanet community. This research will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of hot super-Earths, allowing also to learn more about our own Solar system and the absence of this class of exoplanets in it. This fellowship will establish me at the forefront of the characterisation of hot rocky super-Earths using cutting-edge instruments.",149153,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
WoU-MMA: Pulsar Timing Arrays Around the World CHIME in on Gravitational Waves,"Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is rapidly expanding our ability to study the extreme universe, opening new “windows on the universe. Like electromagnetic radiation, gravitational radiation has a spectrum of possible frequencies, spanning many orders of magnitude. A project at the University of Montana (UM) focuses on the low frequency end of the spectrum – nanohertz gravitational waves observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). In 2023, PTAs around the world reported evidence for a detection of a low-frequency stochastic GW background, most likely arising from the cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries. This project will improve the pulsar timing models for PTAs, add new observatories to the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) dataset, and create combined International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) datasets. This principal investigator (PI) will sponsor annual field trips to observatories participating in multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA) for members of the University of Montana Society of Physics Students (SPS). The principal investigator will also support physics students in beginning their research career and will leverage the existing UM planetarium to create a public outreach show about MMA. Pulsar timing arrays search for GWs by observing large sets of millisecond pulsars over decades with radio telescopes and generating high-precision timing models for each pulsar. The residuals from fitting these timing models to observations show characteristic signals indicative of the presence of the gravitational wave background. Therefore, to improve the GW detector, PTAs must improve their pulsar timing models, which is the primary goal of the project. This will enable the characterization of the GW background and possibly of GW from individual supermassive black hole binary sources while also providing a rich dataset for studies of neutron stars. This work will pursue two primary directions: first, the PI will lead efforts to add new observatories to the NANOGrav dataset. In the near future, this will entail adding data from CHIME/Pulsar and in the further future, this will include data from the proposed DSA-2000 experiment. Second, this work will focus on the creating combined IPTA datasets. This work will support the PI in leading the third such dataset and will allow the development of an improved time-of-arrival generation procedure for the fourth IPTA dataset.

Polaron dynamics from first principles,"Polarons are quasiparticles characterized by charge localization coupled with self-induced lattice distortions. The presence of polaronic states significantly affects the energetic and transport properties of electrons and holes, attracting interest in physics, chemistry, and material science. Since the pioneering work of Landau and Pekar nearly a century ago, many theories based on effective Hamiltonians treating electron-phonon interactions have been developed. In the limit of strong electron-phonon coupling, the charge localizes over a short length scale comparable to the lattice parameter, forming a small polaron. Conversely, in the limit of weak electron-phonon coupling, the charge localizes over a larger length scale encompassing multiple unit cells, forming a large polaron. Density functional theory represents a powerful tool for the ab-initio study of polarons in real materials. Recent advancements in density functionals indicate that polarons can be accurately modelled by suppressing the electron self-interaction. While this can be achieved at a semilocal level of theory for small polarons, modelling large polarons remains challenging due to the computational cost associated with large supercells. Alternative ab-initio theories based on many-body physics have been developed, aiming to unify the treatment of small and large polarons. Here, I propose to advance the state-of-the-art methods for modelling polarons in real materials, with the goal of studying the dynamics of both small and large polarons at the first-principles level of accuracy. This involves developing density functionals free from self-interaction, in conjunction with many-body theories for polarons. In this context, machine learning techniques based on active learning and equivariant neural networks can be employed to perform large time-scale and size-scale dynamics of polarons. This approach enables the exploration of physical insights into microscopic transport mechanisms involving polarons, without resorting to computationally expensive molecular dynamics simulations. The developed methods will be applied to bulk and surface polarons in materials relevant to energy storage and conversion technology, including transition metal oxides and perovskites.",146236,2024,2024,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Chemical Sciences; Condensed Matter Physics
Unravelling Europa's tidal evolution through lineament sequencing,"Jupiter’s moon Europa is a fascinating icy moon with its global subsurface ocean and a geologically young surface. Europa’s habitability will be explored and characterized by long-awaited space missions Europa Clipper (NASA) and Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE; ESA). Linear surface structures, or lineaments, on Europa’s icy surface are expected to evolve out of cracks in the ice shell, stemming from tensile fractures, which might reach Europa’s subsurface ocean. Characterizing the environment that fostered Europa’s rich geologic history, thus, provides insight into the habitability of Europa (e.g. Prockter & Patterson, 2009). However, there are many open questions to address: Is the ice shell thick and convective or thin and brittle?  Are there active plume eruptions on Europa in locations of most recent cracks? How much of the tidal evolution is recorded by mappable linear surface features? Can a sequence of lineaments, ordered by age, unravel the stress evolution and constrain lineament formation mechanisms?I propose to investigate the tidal evolution of Europa, and its implications for surface-ocean exchange processes that foster habitability. The first work package (WP1) contains the development of the Code for ordering lineaments based on cross-cuttings (Colbox). This makes a temporally resolved analysis of preferred lineament directions possible, since cross-cuttings indicate age relationships. Different double ridge formation hypotheses can be tested. The second work package (WP2) constructs a global picture of Europa, using all existing imagery. I conduct a global lineament azimuth study, with the help of an automated mapping framework. Combined with Colbox, I am equipped to test the agreement between preferred directions of lineaments with a variety of stress models. The stress models are based on different ice shell thickness estimates, thermal profiles in the ice shell, and combinations of spin pole precession and non-synchronous rotation rates. With a Bayesian framework and a stress calculation code proposed by Dr. Alyssa Rhoden (Walker & Rhoden, 2022), this temporal disentanglement can shed light on the formation and evolution of lineaments as a method of tracking Europa’s habitability through time. A better knowledge about Europa’s stress field improves our understanding of tidal heating, which influences the thickness of the ice shell. For example, a thinner ice shell could crack more frequently than a thicker shell. Concretely, my analyses have implications for the planning of observations with the Europa Imaging System (EIS) dual camera system onboard Europa Clipper. Europa Clipper arrives at Jupiter in 2030, making my proposed research opportune. Further, I develop and publish methods that enable a rapid first analysis of new imagery from EIS by automating the sequencing of lineaments and combining it with a deep-learning driven mapping of lineaments. I have acquired the scientific finesse and an international network necessary to pursue my challenging research plan. Choosing the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, as a host institution and Dr. Alyssa Rhoden as a collaborating scientist is superb. SwRI provides me with a stimulating, collaborative environment that boosts my career as a planetary scientist. Dr. Alyssa Rhoden is an active and ambitious principal research scientist with long-standing experience with Europa imagery and stress field calculation (Rhoden et al., 2010, 2012, 2015, 2021; Rhoden & Hurford, 2013).",146230,2025,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Earth Sciences; Geology; Space Sciences
REHEAT - REproducible High-temperature Emergent phenomenA in Two-dimensional heterostructures,"Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials offer an excellent platform to access novel physical phenomena at the atomic limit. Within this class of materials, twisted van der Waals heterostructures have provided unique opportunities to access flat-band physics and emergent phenomena driven by strong electron interactions. The moiré potential, formed when twisting two monolayers of 2d materials with respect to each other, has generated a plethora of interesting effects and sparked a very active area of research. However, moiré flat bands emerge rarely in currently known materials, due to very restrictive conditions for their formation, leaving only a handful of example systems that have been successfully fabricated with very precise twist angles between the layers. The temperature scale of the effects and the high variability across different samples have contributed to a lack of reproducibility of results and thus limited systematic study. Here, we propose to use field-effect devices based on materials that are predicted to host robust flat bands. By engineering twisted heterostructures, we anticipate robust ultra-flat bands over a wide range of twist angles. Such a device would allow the investigation of emergent phenomena such as ferromagnetism or superconductivity in a reproducible and controlled manner. Thus, moiré flat bands in twisted systems will be accessible at larger angles, yielding stronger interactions. Hence, we would expect any emergent correlated state to have a much larger temperature scale, a milestone for making such devices more viable. We will investigate exotic phenomena driven by many-body interactions by optical and electrical means, fostering the studies of emergent physics with a reliable and systematic approach. Our findings will shed light on the physical mechanisms happening at the flat band while clearing the path toward the investigation of novel electronic states in 2D field effect devices.",146230,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,United States,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Mixed state properties in quantum engineered twisted van der Waals superconductors,"The possibility to engineer atomically thin heterostructures by twisted vertical stacking of different two-dimensional crystal layers has opened a new chapter in the field of condensed matter physics. Thanks to their artificial nature, these twisted van der Waals materials offer a versatile platform to engineer novel and exotic physical states. Moreover, the two-dimensional (2D) geometry allows for unprecedented control over the properties of these heterostructures through external fields or the twist angle, while guaranteeing direct access to their microscopic physics by means of, e.g., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization. In recent years, the observation of superconductivity in atomic layers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has marked a turning point in the study of van der Waals materials. As a result, much effort is going into understanding superconductivity in these systems, under what conditions it can be made stronger, and how it can be tuned by effect of external fields.As an SNF PostDoc.Mobility fellow, hosted by and collaborating with Prof. Liang Fu at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I will study twisted TMDs to investigate the applications of these novel materials for superconductivity at finite magnetic fields. In the first part of my research, I will construct a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) phenomenological theory describing the modulation of the superconductivity across the moiré superstructure, under the effect of an external electric field. Moreover, I will study the intricate phase pattern resulting from the spin-orbit (SO) coupling in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In a second project, I will probe the superconducting (SC) landscape with a test vortex and study pinning for different values of the twist angle. With this understanding, I will then consider a finite vortex density and investigate the phenomenological properties of twisted superconductors in the technologically relevant mixed state, where commensuration between the moiré structure and the vortex lattice (VL) is important. I will tackle this problem by means of numerical integration of the time-dependent GL equations. In the last part of my research, I will go back to the first project and substantiate the GL theory by means of microscopic calculations for the case study of the group9V TMD niobium diselenide (NbSe2). For all these projects, I will work in a close collaboration with Prof. Fu. Finally, I intend to take part in the strong partnership between Prof. Fu and Dr. Jagadeesh Moodera by engaging in experimental collaborations in the broader field of 2D superconductivity. With combined analytical, numerical and experimental efforts, this project will expand our understanding of twisted TMD superconductors and provide us with the insights necessary to engineer the mixed state properties of these materials at finite fields, with the potential to greatly impact both fundamental science and technological applications.",146229,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Machine Learning in Lattice QCD with Fixed Point Actions,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Kieran Holland at the University of the Pacific. Decades of intensive experimental and theoretical work in particle physics has led to a deeper understanding of how nature behaves at the most fundamental level, with an intricate mathematical description of observed effects between subatomic particles, as well as raising many important and unanswered questions. Modern theoretical physics research takes advantage of a wide variety of computational resources and algorithms, which sometimes provide the only possible way to precisely use the underlying mathematical model, through what are known as “simulations” of how particles behave. In the last few years, the booming field of artificial intelligence or more specifically machine learning has found new applications in science, where enormous datasets can be scoured to give more insight into scientific models. This research is important for the national interest, not only by continuing the nation’s leading role in advancing fundamental science, but also because artificial intelligence is a completely new tool which has already had an enormous impact and could revolutionize societies, much as personal computing has done in the last forty years. By supporting research in this area, the US will continue to be one of the leaders of future technological developments and applications. There will also be a broader impact of the research, through Professor Holland’s mentoring of students in undergraduate research, developing their computing skills for future industry and academic careers, and by sharing the results of the research through public talks. Being more specific, Professor Holland will work on Monte Carlo simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental model for interactions between quarks and gluons, binding them together to form nuclei. Simulations can be systematically improved, for example by using very high resolution when discretizing a physical system, analogous to pixelating an image, but the computational cost increases very rapidly, and can quickly demand more computing power than any supercomputer can provide. An alternative is to find a more complex discretization of a physical system, where even a coarse resolution can be used to obtain correct physical predictions, an approach known as improved lattice actions. Professor Holland will work with machine learning algorithms and software platforms to design a highly improved lattice action for QCD, which he will also test through Monte Carlo simulations, to compare with existing lattice actions in terms of accuracy and computing cost. Part of the project involves parametrization of an improved lattice action, a task ideally suited to machine learning methods. Professor Holland will first work on the dynamics of gluons without quarks, known as pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, where the overall computing cost is lower and can serve both as a testbed for the method, as well as have possible phenomenological impact for predicting the QCD coupling at the Electroweak energy scale, where Yang-Mills theory can connect to the full theory including quarks. As many research groups perform lattice QCD simulations, this work is broadly relevant in exploring ways to maximize efficiency when using large-scale supercomputers to study the properties of QCD.

A novel window on new physics signatures in B decays,"The proposed research will make the world's first measurements of a set of 'gluonic penguin' processes that are highly sensitive to the existence of any new force of nature. Over the past decade, measurements of analogous processes have seen the emergence of a coherent set of discrepancies with respect to the predictions of our current best understanding of particle physics, the Standard Model (SM). These anomalous measurements give tentative evidence for the existence of a new fundamental force of nature, the discovery of which would be revolutionary for science from particle physics to astrophysics and cosmology. The proposed measurements of 'gluonic penguin' processes could establish definitive evidence for such a force. The existing anomalous data have sparked intense theoretical and experimental interest across particle physics. A wide range of new physics (NP) models have been proposed to address the observed tensions. Many of these models can solve major problems of the SM e.g. explaining the patterns in the masses and mixing properties of the known matter particles (the so-called flavour problem), the lightness of the Higgs boson, or the lack of a dark matter candidate. However, while some combinations of the anomalous data indicate a tension greater than five sigma with SM predictions, unequivocally establishing the existence of a new force is inhibited by open and intractable questions about the SM predictions to which the current measurements are compared.  The proposed study of 'gluonic penguins' is essential in order to confirm or refute any NP effects. Any non-SM contribution that can solve the flavour problem would also contribute to these decays. Until recently, searching for NP with 'gluonic penguin' processes has been hindered by the difficulty in making theoretical predictions. However, recent theoretical work has identified a new set of observables that have precise SM expectations. Moreover, this work demonstrates that existing measurements of two 'gluonic penguin' processes show tantalising hints of further anomalies. Although it has not yet been appreciated in the community, the future potential of the modes explored thus far is limited. I propose to make the world's first measurements of these new observables in a set of alternative decay modes that do not suffer from this limitation.A window of opportunity to make the proposed measurements of gluonic penguin modes exists only now. Data from the LHCb experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be used to isolate the signal modes. However, un order to exploit the last data-taking run before the planned three-years shutdown of the LHC, the analysis requires the design and deployment of new algorithms to select both the signal and control samples. It is therefore essential to conduct this research on the proposed timescale. I am expert in the analysis of 'electroweak penguin' processes at LHCb, which are analogous to those that the proposed research would exploit. I studied some of the highest-profile such decays during my PhD and continue leading their study as part of my Forschungskredit postdoc. I therefore have a detailed understanding of the relevant background processes, the tools used to suppress them, and the techniques needed to extract the physics quantities of interest. In particular, I made major contributions to the measurement of the 'RK' observable published in Nature Physics, e.g. by validating the double-ratio measurement strategy that is central for the whole analysis. Unusually for an experimentalist in this field, I have also published a number of papers in collaboration with theorists e.g. I verified the treatment of the key theoretical uncertainty, which the cleanliness of this entire class of observables depends on. Establishing the proposed new programme of measurements will be an essential step in further developing my career as an independent researcher. Measurements of the proposed 'gluonic penguin' processes require the kind of analysis procedure that has been pioneered by the Imperial College London group for their studies of 'electroweak penguin' decays. Combining Imperial's expertise with my experience in isolating the signatures of interest, and my connection with the relevant theory community, will leave us uniquely placed to lead these potentially revolutionary measurements.",145326,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Entropy and Boundary Methods in von Neumann Algebras,"The theory of von Neumann algebras, originating in the 1930's as a mathematical foundation for quantum physics, has since evolved into a beautifully rich subfield of modern functional analysis. Studying the precise structure of von Neumann algebras is rewarding for many reasons, as they appear naturally in diverse areas of modern mathematics such as dynamical systems, ergodic theory, analytic and geometric group theory, continuous model theory, topology, and knot theory. They also continue to be intimately involved in a variety of fields across science and engineering, including quantum physics, quantum computation, cryptography, and algorithmic complexity. The PI will focus on developing a new horizon for research on structural properties of von Neumann algebras, by combining entropy (quantitative) and boundary (qualitative) methods, with applications to various fundamental open questions. This project will also contribute to US workforce development through diversity initiatives and mentoring of graduate students and early career researchers. In this project, the PI will develop two new research directions in the classification theory of finite von Neumann algebras: applications of Voiculescu's free entropy theory to the structure of free products and of ultrapowers of von Neumann algebras; the small at infinity compactification and structure of von Neumann algebras arising from relatively properly proximal groups. This will involve a delicate study of structure, rigidity and indecomposability properties via innovative interplays between three distinct successful approaches: Voiculescu's free entropy theory, Popa's deformation rigidity theory, Ozawa's theory of small at infinity boundaries and amenable actions.

Collaborative Research: Apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control of the MOLLER Experiment,"A central goal of nuclear and particle physics is to obtain a complete understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces through which they interact. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years. However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter. To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. The electron’s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM. Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding. The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers. The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron’s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer. This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model. The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Møller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals. The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus. The work will be done over the period December 2020 – November 2024. This includes the tracking system, background detectors, auxiliary asymmetry measurement detectors, and certain aspects of beam monitoring/control and beam polarimetry.

Connecting galaxy formation and Cosmic Reionization,"Understanding the formation of the first galaxies and how the Universe evolved from an almost neutral state to its current completely ionized state is one of the most interesting frontiers in modern cosmology.With the new window that JWST and SKA will open on the young Universe, theoretical models are needed to understand the physics at work in this poorly-explored epoch. The research I plan to conduct during this Postdoc.Mobility Fellowship is centered on cosmological models of structure formation, more specifically the formation and evolution of the first generation of galaxies and the emergence of the first stars.In the theory of the bottom-up assembly of cosmic structures, one of the main challenges is to connect the smallest, most inconspicuous galaxies we observe today to the building blocks of more massive galaxies such as our own, the Milky Way. Do these so-called dwarf galaxies, resemble the first galaxies formed in the Universe? Having the simplest assembly histories of all galaxies, dwarfs are dominated by old stellar populations. They hosted the first stars and played a major role in lighting up the dark Universe, a few billion years after the Big Bang during the period known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Unlike essentially all larger systems, the present-day dwarfs underwent little to no further evolution after the EoR and constitute pristine relics of the early-Universe. My research aims to answer the following fundamental and related questions:- How did the initial conditions in the early-Universe, in particular primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), which are frequently neglected in models, impact the formation and evolution of the first galaxies?- What is the impact of magnetic fields on the host halos of the first stars and how does it affect both the history of reionization as well as the sources responsible?- How can we deduce the metal-enrichment occurring during the process of galaxy formation from the upcoming spectroscopic data of JWST NIRSpec, which will measure the metallicity of the faintest galaxies?Multiple efforts in recent years to answer these questions can be categorized as (i) simulations that model reionization on large-scale to accurately predict the 21cm signal, (ii) those that simulate much smaller proto-stellar scales, focusing on the mass function of the first stars. I intend to leverage my expertise in cosmological galaxy formation simulations to bridge these two. The unique aspects of this study are: obtaining the high resolution required to resolve the propagation of radiation through the interstellar medium, direct implementation of first stars to include the inhomogeneity in the reionization history, and a complete sample of dark halos.This program is a necessary step in challenging our classical model of the matter power spectrum on small galactic scales. Its outcome will be a detailed comparison of the high-redshift luminosity function and the low mass end of the stellar mass-halo mass relation to the forthcoming discoveries of the JWST, WEAVE, SKA, 4MOST, ELT telescopes and surveys of faint galaxies. This will allow us: (i) to more accurately model magnetic fields at the onset of star formation and the cosmic reionization, (ii) to connect the impact of initial conditions on the formation of the first galaxies to the number density of reionizing sources, as well as (iii) to further constrain the characteristics of PMFs and the elusive nature of the first stars. The expertise of Prof. Devriendt and Prof. Slyz in galaxy formation simulations and that of members of their group, namely, Dr. Katz and Dr. Rey in the EoR and dwarf galaxies will be invaluable for the computational part of the proposal. Comparing simulations and observations will greatly benefit from collaborating with Prof. Bunker (co-I of JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey), specifically when constraining the escape fraction of ionizing photons at high redshift, and detecting the signature of the first generation of metal-free stars in dwarfs. Comparison to observational constraints of PMFs will also be accessible with MIGHTEE (PI: Prof. Jarvis), a HI survey with the MeerKAT instrument, a precursor of SKA.",142408,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
Novel cooperative magnetism in magnetic pyrochlores,"Quantum magnets on the simple yet strongly-frustrated pyrochlore lattice have been heavily investigated due to their flexibility in realizing quantum-mechanical models. From the experimental realization of magnetic monopoles to the long-sought quantum spin liquid states, the physics of these systems can be influenced by the choice of elemental components. In this proposal, I intend to explore two emergent behaviors in pyrochlores. First, the recently theorized realization of topologically non-trivial magnetic quasiparticles in the form of Weyl nodes and Weyl lines. Second, the stabilization of novel quantum magnetic phenomena through enhanced quantum fluctuations combining two mechanisms: the magnetic frustration inherent to pyrochlores; and the near critical behavior found by competing energy scales in 4d transition-metal ions. At the heart of this proposal is the synthesis of single-crystal samples of different pyrochlore materials. Both the proposer's experience and the state-of-the-art crystal growth facilities at the host institution ensure the successful execution of the project. Inelastic neutron scattering and resonant X-Ray scattering will be used to unveil the emergent physics in the proposed magnets. The host group is not only well-known worldwide for its expertise in neutron spectroscopy, but its strategic location near top-tier scientific facilities also plays a crucial role in the rapid development of the proposal. The expected results will impact the field of condensed-matter research as a whole. Understanding the role of topology in magnetic spin waves is crucial, with an ever-growing interest in topologically protected phases of matter. Additionally, the newly discovered quantum phases that arise from frustration may not only shed light on new possibilities for superconductivity but also could be incorporated into nanostructured devices for engineering purposes.",142405,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Noise-induced transitions in active suspensions subject to multistability,"An active matter system is a collection of discrete agents, each dissipating energy on its own ``microscopic' scale in the bulk, thus having irreversible dynamics. This definition includes all systems whose constituents are motile (self-propelled), for instance, bird flocks, bacterial solutions, colloids, and many others. Over the last twenty years, it became increasingly clear that, strikingly, interactions between the microscopic constituents, whether they are direct or indirect (through the medium), could translate into collective dynamics at the macroscopic level. This sometimes proves relevant to applications, for instance in biofilm formation. Of central interest in characterizing collective dynamics, active matter systems exhibit spontaneous reorganization from one state to another. These reorganizations can result from random fluctuations making the system transition from one stable state (or ``phase') to another. Transitions are increasingly rare as the intensity of the fluctuations is weak. Nevertheless, despite being generic and of crucial importance, such transition phenomena remain particularly complicated to study analytically, due to the generally extremely large number of degrees of freedom and the out-of-equilibrium nature of the considered systems.In the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics, steady states of the system minimize a potential, and some laws for the stationary probability distribution and the mean passage time between distinct attractors can be analytically derived. However, active matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium systems, because energy is constantly injected and dissipated at the microscopic level. Consequently, no potential exists, and characterizing rare transitions from one basin of attraction to another is a current scientific challenge. The Freidlin-Wentzell large deviation theory, valid for out-of-equilibrium systems subject to weak noise, gives some elements of the answer. It can be used to show that the most probable trajectory selected by the system for a rare transition from one basin of attraction to another, called an instanton path, can be computed a priori, as it minimizes a certain action in the path integral representation of the system.This research project will focus on the Saintillan-Shelley model for dilute suspension of active particles, modeling for instance E. coli bacteria. It was shown by Ohm and Shelley (2022) that in certain regimes, the isotropic stable steady state could co-exist with other stable states where the particles exhibit a coherent preferred orientation over some regions of space. The co-existence of stable solutions can lead to fluctuations-induced transitions in this active suspension system. This research project aims to compute these rare transition statistics and associated instanton trajectories. For that purpose, the selected approach will be mainly analytical in the first part: we will generalize the mathematical technique used by Ohm and Shelley (2022) for the reduction of the kinetic model to a minimal-order system, to a case where the kinetic model is subject to stochastic forcing. Since it was shown by Ohm and Shelley (2022) that the reduced system can capture the co-existence of multiple stable solutions, we expect the stochastic version to capture the noise-induced transition between them. Crucially, the low dimensionality of the reduced system (two or four degrees of freedom) makes it possible to establish noise-induced transition statistics at an extremely low numerical cost.The second part of the research plan will be numerical: the very recent algorithm published by Zakine and Vanden-Eijden (2023), will be implemented directly on the active suspension Saintillan-Shelley kinetic model (without prior dimensionality reducing, thus relaxing the hypothesis made in the first part). This algorithm is based on a gradient descent to compute the instanton and the associated transition statistics. Results will be directly compared to those of the first part.We believe this research project will shed light on the mechanisms behind the transition of active suspension systems from an isotropic, uniform state to more complex ones where the particles show large-scale patterns in alignment and concentration, as observed experimentally.",142405,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Classical Physics
"Moduli spaces of stable, logarithmic, and tropical maps","Enumerative algebraic geometry aims to count geometric objects satisfying certain conditions. A major break-through in the subject happened in 1994, when, motivated by string theory, Kontsevich introduced the moduli spaces of stable maps and used them to get recursive formulas for the number of degree d rational curves in the projective plane P2 passing through 3d - 1 general points. After Kontsevich, the area of enumerative geometry concerning curve counting problems has become a very active field of research, called Gromov-Witten theory. In 2003, G. Mikhalkin suggested a new approach to the curve counting problem, showing that there is a natural correspondence between algebraic and tropical curves, and in certain nice situations one can hope to obtain the count of algebraic curves via tropical methods. Since then, the connection between tropical and algebraic geometry has flourished, leading to the adoption of tropical methods in the study of various algebraic problems. In 2011, M. Gross and B. Siebert proposed a broad generalization of Gromov-Witten theory, introducing logarithmic stable maps. Tropical and logarithmic stable maps play fundamental roles in the approaches to mirror symmetry of Kontsevich-Soibelman and of Gross-Siebert. Today, moduli spaces of stable maps are fundamental in several mathematical and physical disciplines, such as Gromov-Witten theory, mirror symmetry, string theory, and quantum field theory.The following research plan proposes to study several aspects of such spaces and their interactions.",142405,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics; Nuclear and Plasma Physics
RAPID: Antarctic Deployment of Cryoscope,"This project is to install, commission and operate a fully cryogenic, 26cm aperture near-infrared telescope at Concordia station in the Antarctic. This instrument, called the Cryoscope Pathfinder, is actually a quarter-scale prototype for a cutting edge wide-field 1-meter class telescope that will be designed for multi-messenger astrophysics. Cryoscope Pathfinder will demonstrate this new technology for the first time by conducting a survey to detect transient and time varying events in the near-infrared from Antarctica, a site with ideal conditions to showcase the improvements over previous telescopes. Cryoscope Pathfinder is a technology demonstrator for a very wide field infrared survey telescope that will deliver the sensitivity and field of view (FOV) required to localize infrared transients such as the neutron star – black hole mergers detected by LIGO. The telescope is optimized for operation in the K_dark spectral passband which falls between the last atmospheric airglow lines at 2.35 microns and the onset of water absorption at 2.55 microns. To take advantage of this atmospheric window, a new approach was required since established techniques cannot reduce thermal emission from the telescope below that of the darker sky while delivering the tens of square degrees FOV required for a rapid survey rate. Cryoscope Pathfinder is thus specifically designed to take advantage of the K_dark band which is unique to the cold sky over Antarctica, and it can only reach its full potential on the high plateau of Dome C due to the lower temperatures and better atmospheric stability (seeing) than are found even at the South Pole.

Exploiting mid-circuit measurement for entanglement generation in arrays of hundreds of atomic qubits,"Current quantum devices face a challenge in generating long-range entanglement through unitary evolution. Deep quantum circuits of many qubits are highly susceptible to the accumulation of errors and single-particle decoherence effects. Measurement and feedback, however, enable a shortcut: In the same way that quantum teleportation can facilitate distance entanglement, a measurement of a subset of constituents of a many-body system can overcome the limits of unitary entanglement spread and accelerate long-range entanglement.In recent years, neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers have emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing. High-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates see new records yearly, and the platform shows great promise to scale. A remaining challenge, mid-circuit measurements (MCM), was recently accomplished, which makes the platform a suitable candidate for exploring how combinations of high-fidelity gates and measurements can push the frontier of quantum information science.Joining Professor Adam Kaufman’s research group at CU Boulder/NIST presents an ideal next step to be at the forefront of this rapidly evolving frontier. The group is recognized as one of the pioneers, having made significant contributions to the development of optical tweezers with neutral atoms as a platform for quantum simulation, quantum metrology, and quantum computing.The team has already made significant progress in understanding the fundamental properties of ytterbium-171 in optical tweezers. They achieved high loading efficiency, high imaging fidelity, and demonstrated single-qubit fidelities above 99.9%. Additionally, in a recently published preprint, the team expanded their toolbox and added MCMs, qubit reset, control of the metastable qubit, and improved ground-state cooling. The combination of a well-controlled, long-lived qubit with an MCM several orders of magnitude shorter than its lifetime suggests that ytterbium-171 offers ideal conditions to push this platform for schemes that create long-range entanglement via measurement. This research project aims to build upon these accomplishments to achieve several critical objectives. First, the focus will be on adding high-fidelity two-qubit gates. Recently, it has been shown that this can be achieved through Rydberg single-photon excitation, which the team has already started to implement. Second, we will add programmability by incorporating site selectivity of single- and two-qubit gates. To do so, we will explore novel holography and beam-steeringschemes to scale the system up to a few hundred qubits and further improve the fidelity of the MCMs. With these novel capabilities in place, we will use the MCM architecture to demonstrate the creation of large cluster states and the distillation of the toric code state through measurement and feedforward.

Explore the Memory of Gravity,"More than a hundred years after Einstein’s prediction of their existence, the gravitational wave revolution in physics has now begun. While almost a hundred events of binary coalescence’s have already been observed and analyzed, the community already prepares for the promise of next generation gravitational wave detectors to probe the limits of our understanding of the gravitational interaction even deeper and eventually go beyond our horizon of current knowledge. This promise includes an upcoming direct measurement of the scars in the fabric of spacetime left behind by gravitational waves as a direct consequence of the immanent non-linearity of gravitation. These permanent distortions of proper distances are known as gravitational wave memory and represent a unique opportunity to test the theory of gravity in its defining properties.In this project, we propose to pave the way for future gravitational wave memory observations to expand on our fundamental understanding of the gravitational interaction. Concretely, we will 1.) Advance the theoretical understanding of the memory effect in generic metric theories of gravity. 2.)Construct the first parameterized memory models beyond general relativity, ready to use for future tests of strong gravity. 3.) Pioneer a model independent extraction of the memory signal that opens the door to a novel search for additional gravitational degrees of freedom.This undertaking will build on recent work by Jann Zosso and his supervisors that initiated a new approach of computing gravitational wave memory in generic metric theories of gravity. These first stepping stones towards the aim of the proposed research will decisively be complemented by the expertise of Prof. Vitor Cardoso, the designated host, and his group, in extracting information on fundamental physics from both current and future gravitational wave data. A combination of analytical and numerical computations, together with previous experience with waveform modeling, effects beyond general relativity and next generation gravitational wave observations of both the fellow and the host, will lead to the success of this ambitious endeavor.It is indispensable to carry out the proposed research now in order to guide the science of the next generation of ground-based and space-born gravitational wave observatories and be ready to take full advantage of the upcoming detection of gravitational wave memory and the challenges this entails. Completing this project will provide the field with both the theoretical, as well as the crucial first modelling basis to carry out tests of general relativity in the full non-linear regime through the memory effect. Moreover, it will establish gravitational wave memory as a universal detector of radiated energy and therefore not only complement but also extend current searches for additional gravitational polarizations to all fundamental propagating degrees of freedom that might still be hiding from us.The field of research on gravitational wave memory is currently on the rise, and it is timely to push its inquiry to the next level by preparing to exploit the valuable future data streams. This project will provide a significant boost to this unexplored handle to probe our understanding of gravity, and will spark the interest in this fascinating topic among the gravitational wave community and beyond.",138581,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Particle and High Energy Physics
Time-delay cosmography in the era of large sky sruvey,"Background: The LambdaCDM model, despite its numerous successes in explaining various observations - from the Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB) to the Large-Scale Structures of the Universe and its accelerated expansion - has recently faced challenges from new observations that seem to conflict with its predictions. A prime example of these discrepancies is the Hubble Tension, which has now reached a 5-sigma significance level. This might suggest that the LambdaCDM model is not a complete representation of our universe, opening up exciting possibilities for discovering new physics. However, to firmly establish whether this tension is of cosmological origin or a result of systematic errors, it is imperative to acquire a multitude of independent measurements. Methods: The goal of this project is to use time-delay cosmography with strongly lensed quasar to obtain a competitively precise measurement of the Hubble Constant, H0, independently from the distance ladder method, which is currently the most precise way of determining H0 but might be affected by systematic errors. Building upon my earlier Postdoc Mobility project, I plan to harness the data from LSST to acquire time-delay measurements for a large, statistically significant sample of lensed quasars. This scalable method, suitable for potentially thousands of lensed quasars, will undergo rigorous testing on simulated data. We will evaluate the entire analysis chain from the images to the inference of cosmological parameters. Additionally, to address potential systematic errors in lens modeling, I propose the incorporation of a prior on the halo mass of these strong lenses, informed by weak lensing analyses.Results: The immediate objectives of the project include: i) validating the existing hierarchical Bayesian framework designed for analyzing large and heterogeneous samples of lenses, ii) exploring the application of weak lensing to resolve inherent degeneracies in strong lensing, and iii) increasing the number of identified lensed quasars with measured time-delays within the LSST footprint. As soon as the survey starts, this latter objective will involve not only measuring time delays for previously known lenses but also identifying new lensed quasars in LSST by their variability. Ultimately, this project is intended to lay the groundwork for future joint Euclid/LSST time-delay cosmography analyses with thousands of lenses. Impact: The research outlined in this proposal has the potential to markedly enhance the measurement of H0 through time-delay cosmography, with strong implications for understanding the nature of Dark Energy. Our goal is to achieve a H0 measurement with 1-2% precision within the first few years of the survey. Such precision would be sufficient to ascertain the cosmological basis of the Hubble tension, addressing one of the major challenges in cosmology.",138199,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Particle and High Energy Physics
Attosecond and Strong Field Physics in Correlated Multielectron System,"The astonishing advances in the generation of attosecond light pulses, and the availability of high-intensity lasers in the near-infrared region, have opened up a field of new possibilities in the study of the real-time electron dynamics in complex systems. One of the goals of attosecond and strong-field physics is to access fundamental information on electronic motion in its natural time scale and be able to control charge migration in molecules, e.g., to select a specific bond breaking at a molecular site, or to trigger a chemical reaction. The main objective of the project is to develop a new, efficient, and versatile numerical method to support the experimental and theoretical study of the interaction of multi-electron systems with ultra-short and intense laser pulses. This work aims at contributing to the development of attochemistry and ultimately bridge the gap between attosecond physics and biology. In addition, as connecting experimental measurements to real-time meaningful physical observables has shown to be far from simple, new methods will be investigated to track the rapid dynamics of photoelectron emitted from different valence shells in molecules, as well as during tunnel ionization in intense laser fields. With attosecond physics becoming among the most thriving fields of science, new theoretical tools are needed to support the exploration of attosecond phenomena in complex systems. ATTOMESA, a new numerical method for ultrafast physics, will be designed to treat various multiphoton processes investigated with current experimental setups, and to study unexplored aspects of driven multielectron attosecond and strong field dynamics in atoms and molecules. The formalism used in ATTOMESA includes electron correlation and exchange, as well as inter-channel coupling. It is based on a hybrid quadrature approach, where a quantum-chemistry description using Gaussian-type orbitals is used in the short-range to mid-range electron-molecule interaction region, while finite-element discretized variable representation functions complement the description at larger electronic radius, resulting in a highly efficient parallel ab initio method able to treat strong field processes in molecules. Consequently, processes such as high-harmonic generation and frustrated tunnel ionization can be handled fully ab initio. In this work, the following physical processes will be treated with ATTOMESA; photoionization time delay near a Cooper minimum and between different valence shells using a new spectroscopic method, estimation of electronic coherence in a biomolecule after sudden photoionization, and finally assessing the role of electron correlation in streaking/attoclock experiments. Finally, Bohmian mechanics will be employed as a useful tool to interpret strong-field phenomena in atoms. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",138092,2024,2024,NSF,United States,United States,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Dynamics of the solar corona in the era of data intensive observations (DynaSun),"More than 90% of the visible Universe is in the form of a plasma - the fourth state of matter. The study of physical properties of a plasma forms one of the most far ranging and challenging research areas in physics today. From cosmological objects to controlled fusion, this complex, but fundamental state of matter is proving to be of ever-greater significance in understanding the dynamics of the Universe and in harnessing the material world for the greatest technological result and the improvement of our society.
The strategic aims of plasma research relate to the global challenges faced by humankind. One is the ecologically friendly and practically endless source of energy, the controlled fusion reaction that is believed to be achievable in magnetic confinement reactors, tokamaks. The working body in tokamaks reactors is a plasma. Another is the understanding of the key ingredient of the Earth's climate change, the solar effect on the Earth's climate. Also, the plasma research plays the central role in Space Weather, the study of the solar-terrestrial relations through the physical processes operating in the heliosphere. This branch of science is becoming increasingly important in the context of space exploration, e.g., Moon and Mars expeditions, and the stability and safety of space-based telecommunication and tele-navigation systems, energy supply lines and pipelines. Last but not least is the study of plasma physics of fundamental astrophysical processes. The solar corona is a showcase (""Rosetta stone"") for plasma behaviour in other astrophysical objects. This makes the plasma research one of the strategic directions of Physical Sciences.
Despite of the abundance of the plasma state of matter in the Universe, the physical conditions on the Earth do not allow us to reach the plasma easily. The intrinsic difficulties of the laboratory plasma research are the cost and the technological problems of plasma creation and confinement. This motivates our interest in the space plasma systems, such as the atmosphere of the Sun, where the plasma is naturally created and is open to direct high-resolution study. Solar plasma systems are used as natural plasma laboratory that provide us with a vast variety of plasma configurations and physical conditions. The study of the solar corona, the upper, fully ionised and very hot part of the solar atmosphere, is of particular importance not only because of its unique physical state (high temperature, high density, strong magnetic field), which makes it close to the conditions in controlled fusion reactors, but also because of its direct relevance to solar-terrestrial relations, such as Space Weather and the Earth's climate. Coronal research itself faces several key challenges, including understanding of mechanisms for coronal plasma heating, and energetics and physical scenarios of energy releases such as flares and coronal mass ejections, and the physical conditions leading to them. In the proposed research we address outstanding questions of modern solar physics connected with dynamic phenomena in the solar atmosphere summarised below, and described in dedicated work packages (WP). The key common theme linking the proposed research are magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves which are a ubiquitous feature of solar atmospheric dynamics,",137929,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Astronomical Sciences
Searching for the youngest population of gas giant planets,"To distinguish between formation mechanisms and to calibrate the widely used evolutionary tracks that relate mass and luminosity for more evolved companions, a broad sample of young, still forming imaged planets is required. To this purpose, I will (i) use new facilities like the upgraded MIRAC-5 instrument installed at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona, the only ground-based Adaptive Optics (AO) assisted camera able to provide high-contrast imaging data in the 5-12 µm range from spring 2024; and (ii) continue using the state-of-the-art MagAO-X camera at the Las Campanas Observatory, the best available adaptive optics system in the visual wavelength range. These observations probe different mechanisms: while the MIRAC-5 camera is sensitive to thermal emission from protoplanets and provides information about temperature and radius, MagAO-X is sensitive to accretion processes and constraints the mass accretion rate. Combining these complimentary approaches could validate the current theory suggesting that planets that emit little accretion luminosity start their post-formation phase ‘hot’, while in case a lot of entropy is released throughout accretion shocks, planets start ‘cold’. One of the major advantages of my strategy compared to previous surveys is that the target selection is based on a new approach that uses high spatial and spectral resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array to reveal the characteristic kinematic signatures associated with embedded, giant protoplanets. Forward modeling of these hydrodynamic features yields robust constraints on the locations and masses of the perturbing protoplanets, providing a sample which represents the best opportunity to study the process of atmospheric accretion. The proposed program will allow me to provide crucial empirical evidence of where and how giant planets form, and connect these findings with theoretical work on planet formation and evolution conducted at the University of Zürich. These results will have a substantial impact on the research field of planet formation as they will be crucial to inform future simulations and modelling, together with the development of new MIR instrumentation. Importantly, they will pave the path to the future MIR camera METIS that will be installed at the european Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).",137369,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Space Sciences
Ultra-narrow linewidth CW high power Ti:Sapphire laser and frequency doubler for UV to NIR operation,"The development of integrated photonic systems has gathered tremendous research interest in the last decades. This is carried by the rapid maturing of novel integrated photonic materials and their ever-improving nanofabrication, while being pushed by applications such as related to quantum computing, metrology, spectroscopy or biological sensing, where practicality dictates for chip-scale devices. To best address the needs of such diverse applications, and to leverage the specificities offered by the wide optical spectrum, integrated platforms capable of operating efficiently either over a broad or a targeted spectral window are essential. While a lot of work have been focused on the development of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) operating in the telecom wavelength range, driven by the telecom industry and the growing need for bandwidth, new advances are required in order to fully exploit the short wavelength end of the spectrum (from the ultraviolet - UV - to the near infrared - NIR) central to the needs of quantum and biological systems. Integrated structures that can convert light to and from this spectral region, as well as guide and manipulate it, are critical building blocks for any PICs. Many of these blocks will leverage nonlinear optics, which has already enabled the development of a large variety devices with considerable impact on daily life and society and a key enabling technology for emerging applications.  Regardless of the technology, the proper characterization of fabricated devices is crucial to quantify behavior but also to permit optimization. In that regard, high performance ultra-narrow tunable continuous wave (CW) light sources delivering high power, and optical spectrum analyzers are key for the measurements of any optical systems and devices, from simple loss to more advanced ones such as microresonators quality factors, free-spectral-range or nonlinear shifts. With the up and coming access to optical platforms with large transparency windows spanning from the UV/visible to the middle infrared (MIR), such as silicon nitride (SiN), lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI), aluminum nitride (AlN), or silicon carbide (SiC) just to name a few, taking full ad-vantage of the technology means that the characterization needs to move away from standard telecom equipment, where such tunable light sources are more easily accessible but limited to the 1.3 to 1.6 micron range.This proposal therefore seeks to establish laboratories at EPFL with the most advanced ultra-narrow linewidth CW high power source covering the near UV to the NIR and concomitant integrated photonic and material expertise. With a commercial tool such as the SolsTiS Doublet, together with the already available high resolution, high speed and high sensitivity optical spectrum analyzers, the PI will not only be able to engage in the de-sign of photonic devices for targeted light generation in the critical but challenging near UV - NIR spectral range, but also to investigate and exploit novel properties of wide bandgap semiconductors or photoresists.",136671,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Quantum entanglement: advancing detection methods and thermodynamic implications,"In the past two decades, numerous breakthrough experiments have demonstrated unprecedented control over quantum systems, leading to tremendous progress in the field of quantum information. As a result, quantum technologies have started to turn from theoretical proposals into practical reality; the list already includes communication, sensing, simulation, and computation. A key resource for numerous tasks in thesedirections, particularly to see an advantage or supremacy over classical physics, is quantum entanglement. This is an area of research that has also seen a great deal of progress in both theory and experiments and was deservedly recognised with a Nobel Prize in the previous year.On the other hand, is the field of Quantum Thermodynamics, a highly interdisciplinary area of research that aims to describe thermodynamic effects in quantum systems. Apart from holding fundamental significance, this field has been proposed to be relevant for a variety of technological applications. The role of entanglement in quantum thermodynamics is one of the big frontiers in the field.The common theme of my research plan is quantum entanglement, in which I propose two work packages.1. Entanglement detection: The faithful and feasible detection of entangled states is a crucial task in quantum information processing. The goal in this work package will be two-fold.a. Resource-efficient detection methods for high-dimensional and multipartite entanglement. Efficient means of entanglement certification and quantification tailored to be applied to large entangled states are necessary as we move forward in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and beyond.b. Realistic entanglement detection schemes without strong assumptions of perfect measurements or ideal experimental conditions. Taking into account present-day experimental limitations is essential to bring theoretical proposals to the lab.2. Quantum advantage in thermodynamics: The second work package will focus on the role of entanglement and coherence in quantum-thermodynamic tasks. Potential applications of entanglement in thermodynamics have been the subject of widespread efforts. Whether entanglement can lead to an unambiguous advantage in thermodynamics has been an open question for many years.Overall, the work packages propose ambitious goals, while leaving enough room for contingency. The first work package, being outside the scope of my research till now, will provide an excellent opportunity to expand the domain of my expertise. The upcoming group of Prof. Armin Tavakoli is the ideal place to take up this challenge, as he is a leading expert in quantum information science. The second work package is a natural and important endeavour given my background in open quantum systems. It will also benefit from the other members of the department, including Prof. Peter Samuelsson, who is an expert in open quantum systems.",136329,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Quantum Physics"
Topological Quantum Computing in Real Materials,"In the past few years, both academic and commercial interest in quantum computing has surged, with a rapidly growing landscape of encouraging platforms, devices, and workflows. Despite high-profile developments in industry, however, theoretical obstacles in state preparation and measurement error, gate fidelity, and quantum state tomography, still remain. A promising route to overcome several of these challenges is via topological quantum computing, which uses topological matter to store information that is immune to decoherence and noise. The idea is to braid quasiparticles that are unique to two dimensions, known as anyons, which obey neither bosonic nor fermionic spin statistics. Exchanging these particles results in a phase factor and potentially a ground-state shift, which can be leveraged to build robust logic gates and ultimately, a universal quantum computer, if the appropriate type of non-Abelian anyons are used. Although the proposal is ambitious, tremendous progress has been made recently, such as the first observation of anyonic statistics in real materials and the first braiding of Abelian and non-Abelian anyons in quantum computers. Motivated by the theoretical hurdles facing the industry today, the demonstrated impact of topological phases of matter, as well as the potential for robust quantum computing at zero field and high temperature, the aim of this proposal is to construct state-of-the-art computational models of anyons in graphene, which have recently been observed experimentally, in order to simulate their braiding and guide future experiments.The simulation of large, 2D, strongly-correlated, quantum many-body systems, such as those demonstrating anyons in real materials, is a long-standing numerical challenge, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. In this proposal, we employ tensor networks to make progress, which systematically truncate the least-important entangled degrees of freedom, while capturing the essential physics. The well-known drawback of tensor network methods, however, is that they are most effective for 1D systems, where a canonical form of the network is guaranteed and the algorithms are highly efficient. Moreover, 2D networks often suffer from poor system-size scaling or a prohibitively complicated implementation. Hence, a large part of this proposal involves developing algorithms based on a restricted 2D tensor network ansatz, known as isometric tensor networks (isoTNS), which leverages highly-efficient 1D algorithms, has a favorable system-size scaling, and is comparatively simple to implement. By using this recently-proposed network structure, we can extend the class of Hamiltonians that isoTNS are known to represent and consequently simulate the large 2D quantum many-body systems that are required to connect with ongoing graphene experiments. The overall impact is the first simulation of chiral gapped Hamiltonians using isoTNS, as well as the first simulation of anyon braiding in real materials, which will result in a new numerical tool to study 2D quantum many-body systems, as well as a step towards topological quantum computing at zero field.",136087,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics"
RUI: Quotient Spaces and the Double Soul Conjecture,"The Principal Investigator will investigate shapes called manifolds which are of particular importance due to the critical role they play in Einstein's general theory of relativity. His main focus will be on a special class of manifolds which are called double disk bundles. The PI intends to increase our understanding of the relationships which exist between double disk bundles and other important classes of manifolds. The PI will accomplish this via projects ranging in scope from undergraduate research experiences to international collaborations. The PI's work, motivated by the Double Soul Conjecture and the recent introduction of codimension one biquotient foliations, seeks to improve our understanding of double disk bundles both topologically and geometrically. From the topological side, he intends to increase our understanding of when certain spaces of geometric interest, such as homogeneous spaces and biquotients, carry a double disk bundle structure. On the geometric side, he intends to use double disk bundle structures in the construction of new examples of manifolds with interesting Riemannian metrics.

Impact of magnetic activity on the characterization of FGKM main-sequence host-stars,"Stars, as the fundamental constituents of the Universe, shape its chemical evolution and provide essential insights into the building blocks of life. Recent advancements in stellar characterization, facilitated by space-based photometry missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS, have propelled asteroseismology to unprecedented heights. By studying stellar oscillations, akin to Earth's seismology, we gain access to the internal layers of distant stars, enabling us to constrain transport processes and refine stellar parameters such as mass, radius, and age. Precise and accurate stellar models are pivotal in understanding the evolution of planetary systems and unraveling the galactic history through Galactic Archeology. Leveraging the success of previous missions, asteroseismic modeling will play a key role in the future PLATO mission and other proposed missions like HAYDN and CubeSpec. Moreover, large-scale surveys, such as GAIA, GALAH, and APOGEE, provide a wealth of complementary data, ushering in a new golden era of data-driven stellar physics.Despite these remarkable achievements, asteroseismology has uncovered significant discrepancies in the physics of theoretical stellar models, which have the potential to bias stellar characterization beyond the precision level demanded by space-based photometry missions. Particularly, the treatment of near-surface layers in stellar models and the impact of magnetic activity have emerged as critical limitations. It was recently demonstrated employing synthetic data that magnetic activity, previously overlooked, might have a non-negligible impact on asteroseismic characterization (up to 10% in age, while PLATO mandates 10% precision for age). Over 60% of Kepler observations of main-sequence stars exhibiting activity variations, it is imperative to explore and quantify the influence of magnetic activity on stellar characterization.This project aims to achieve two key objectives:Objective 1: Quantify the impact of magnetic activity on the characterization of ten FGKM main-sequence host-stars based on seismic and non-seismic observations.Objective 2: Develop a modeling procedure which consistently accounts for magnetic activity while providing precise and accurate stellar parameters.To this end, the project is structured into three parts, employing a comprehensive analysis of ten benchmark targets (~ 0.1-1.6 Msun) representing K and M-type, solar-type, and F-type stars. Leveraging high-quality observational data for these targets, I will measure the temporal evolution of stellar parameters over several years (typically four) and assess the impact of magnetic activity. The collaboration with the Astronomy and Space Physics Division in Uppsala is particularly valuable due to our highly complementary research interests. I will contribute my expertise in asteroseismology while benefiting from their proficiency in stellar atmosphere modeling and detailed chemical abundance analyses, enabling me to expand my modeling techniques and tools to characterize both more massive F-type stars and less massive K and M-type stars. By combining these refined modeling tools with benchmark results, I will establish a consistent and innovative modeling procedure to account for magnetic activity in FGKM host-stars, while ensuring precise and accurate stellar characterization for future space-based photometry missions. Notably, PLATO relies on accurate stellar characterization to provide precise and reliable dating of planetary systems.This project offers a unique opportunity to learn from eminent senior researchers, such as Prof. Kochukhov, Dr. Amarsi, and Prof. Heiter, whose interests align closely with mine and the project’s objectives, and to foster new collaborations with their extensive network of collaborators. Moreover, the results of this project will have a profound influence on neighboring fields, particularly galactic archaeology and exoplanetology, benefiting from improved characterization of FGKM host-stars. The development of modeling strategies that account for magnetic activity in these stars is particularly valuable for my career and paves the way for future projects exploring star-planet interactions.",135654,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
EMERGENT FUNCTIONALITY AND INDUCTANCE OF NONCOLLINEAR QUANTUM MAGNETS,"Understanding and manipulating the quantum nature of electrons in solids, including their magnetic spin and their dual nature as both particles and waves, is one of the core principles of modern condensed matter research. Recent years have seen a remarkable expansion of human knowledge, especially as regards the phase degree of freedom of electronic quantum waves. In this PostDoc.Mobility fellowship we aim to implement magnetic semiconductors as inductor devices, based on the interrelation of an electron’s spin and its quantum mechanical phase. The proposed device, coined emergent inductor, exploits the spin dynamics of helimagnets or antiferromagnets. It may replace one of the most fundamental building blocks of electronic circuits, the electrical inductor, with a device that can be many orders of magnitude smaller than conventionally available inductors.The proposed fellowship is built around a sensible workflow, with a limited number of interconnected tasks that are designed to be both efficient, from a perspective of time management, and feasible, given the research environment in the host professor’s laboratory. As a doctoral student, the candidate has already acquired many scientific skills essential for the successful completion of this work. In addition, access to cutting-edge laboratories for chemical synthesis and device fabrication at U.

Vibronic coherence in ultrafast excited state dynamics and its application in sub-picosecond photoredox catalysis,"Chemical reactions proceed along complex pathways as reactants transform into products. Controlling these dynamics through synthetic design is a longstanding goal in chemistry, directing the reaction pathway. Vibronic coherence is a phenomenon that connects the electronic and geometric properties of molecules and represents a link between quantum information and molecular functionality. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the information contained in vibronic coherences allows us to control excited state dynamics. Starting with relatively simple Cr(III) and Co(III) first-row transition metal complexes, we aim to develop a protocol to identify relevant coherence modes by analyzing the phase and dephasing time of the coherence signal using femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy techniques. The goal is to establish a link between the degrees of freedom and the evolution of the excited state electronic, spin, and nuclear coordinates. This is anticipated to help identify a subset of degrees of freedom linked to the active modes defining the excited-state reaction coordinate of these compounds. The guided synthetic manipulation of these active modes is expected to control intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) rates, enabling the development of next-generation first-row transition metal chromophores. Controlling these excited state dynamics may further allow reactivity from higher excited states within photocatalyst-substrate aggregates, preventing thermal relaxation to the less reactive lowest excited state. Such higher excited state reactivity could pave the way for fundamentally new photochemical transformations beyond current kinetic and thermodynamic limits.",134306,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,"Chemical Sciences; Inorganic Chemistry; Physical Chemistry; Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics"
Unconventional phenomena in kagome materials at the 2D limit,"In a world of ever-growing energy demands, humanity’s continued survival hangs on our mastery of manipulating material properties and novel degrees of freedom to conserve power in next-generation electronic devices. This synergy between technological evolution and materials research is crucial and a driving factor for efficient implementation of innovations in our society. This necessitates material platforms with novel electronic functionalities and enhanced mechanical properties. In particular, the interplay of quantum phases intertwined with superconducting, magnetic and topological phases can give rise to a high degree of tunability driven by competing interactions. Kagome lattice materials have long been predicted to be the ideal platform for hosting unconventional phases, given the band structure arising from the geometric frustration featuring flat bands, van Hove singularities, and topological Dirac points. My research has uncovered unconventional charge order featuring time-reversal symmetry-breaking (TRSB) intertwined with unconventional superconductivity, and my doctoral research experience at the Paul Scherrer Institut has provided a deep knowledge and intimate familiarity with magnetic order from a microscopic perspective. While these exciting unconventional correlated states have been explored extensively in bulk, one of the implicit assumptions is that the two dimensional (2D) structural motif defines the electronic properties; however, isolating a truly two-dimensional kagome lattice has been rarely achieved experimentally. At the 2D limit, this system may experience enhanced fluctuations resulting from the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the interplay between competing orders becomes fascinating. Here we seek to isolate the first truly-2D kagome system and explore the ordering and interaction of competing states to the true 2D limit in kagome materials, to elucidate for the first time the microscopic origin of time-reversal symmetry-breaking concomitant with charge order. This will be accomplished through micromechanical exfoliation of the AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) materials followed by advanced characterization. Additionally, the interlayer coupling (effective two-dimensionality) can be controlled by the application of strain, which may be used to tune between competing states. Once the individual layers have been understood, heterostructures will be constructed to probe collective excitations via inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, and could find device application as spin polarizers in spin valves. The elucidation of the intertwining of electronic order and magnetic states in kagome materials will provide a significant advancement in our theoretical understanding of this materials class. The manipulation of spin degrees of freedom (spintronics) lies at the frontier of next-generation technologies. These make use of the quantum properties of the electron (i.e. spin) for information transfer, and boast significant advantages like low energy consumption and faster data processing. The relatively high temperature (above liquid-nitrogen, LN2) TRSB state found in these materials promises easy technological implementation of the novel tunability and fine control of electronic and magnetic properties, which may usher in a new age of quantum devices.",128905,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Towards nonequilibrium ab initio calculations that include nonlocal correlations,"Complex quantum materials consist of systems characterized by competing and correlated degrees of freedom whose interplay can give rise to symmetry-broken states. This competition involves spin, orbital, charge and lattice degrees of freedom relevant at comparable energy scales. One way to separate them apart is via fine-tuned laser pulse excitation of correlated systems, which can reveal hidden states of distinct nature. Moreover, dimensionality is an important aspect when it comes to describing the phases of matter. In low-dimensional correlated systems, close to phase instabilities and crossovers, nonlocal correlations become unavoidable to properly capture the underlying phase ordering mechanisms. Up to hundreds of femtoseconds after an impulsive excitation, the order parameter of a transient dynamical phase transition exhibits fluctuations with distinct nonthermal criticality and the electronic band structure can be strongly renormalized. To access nonlocal correlations, single- and two-particle correlation functions need to be calculated consistently, and this is challenging for several reasons. There lacks out-of-equilibrium methods that include both local and nonlocal correlations while treating various degrees of freedom. Dynamical Mean Field theory (DMFT) solely captures local correlations, GW+DMFT only charge fluctuations, the phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (tdGL) only considers low-order microscopic electronic fluctuations and time-dependent Density Functional Theory (tdDFT) doesn’t capture inelastic scattering processes which are relevant for thermalization at long times. In addition, for numerical methods based on the nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism (NEGF), the computational time scales as O(t^2) and memory requirements become quickly overwhelming, prohibiting long-time evolution of systems.One can work on two main fronts to improve the accuracy and predictive power of one’s theoretical model: the refinement of the effective model Hamiltonian (model-based front) and the elaboration of more efficient computational methods or numerical workarounds to reduce the computational effort (method-based front). The 24 months of this project (mobility phase) would be devoted to alleviating the computational overhead of numerical many-body quantum (NMBQ) methods and using them to address fundamental questions. The usage of the numerical methods - developed and improved during the mobility phase - to perform realistic material calculations would be subsequent to the mobility phase. This mobility phase includes1. The development of novel methods that combine nonequilibrium DMFT and the Two-Particle Self-Consistent (TPSC) approach which takes care of the nonlocal spin and charge correlations. These methods would be used to compute nonlocal dynamical susceptibilities and self-consistently improve the nonequilibrium DMFT self-energy, a key quantity to access interacting single-particle observables.2. The elaboration and implementation of numerical schemes that decrease the computational cost of numerical methods based on NEGF. These schemes would make use of memory truncation techniques, compact representation basis to store NEGF, and methods that extrapolate the time-diagonal of NEGF. These schemes would be applied on GW+DMFT, TPSC+DMFT and TPSC variants.3. Apply TPSC+DMFT and GW+DMFT augmented with the numerical schemes to study the 1) ultrafast renormalization of electronic interactions, 2) processes of dynamical symmetry breaking from a microscopic perspective and 3) the pseudogap physics through photoexcitation.Realizing the mobility phase would make possible the simulation of nonthermal symmetry-broken states up to experimentally relevant times of the order of picoseconds. This would consequently allow one to study accurately on a theoretical basis the collapse and revival of nonthermal ordered phases triggered and controlled via impulsive excitations. For example, one could study the photoinduced metastable SC state in K3C60 molecular compounds and the photoinduced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 compounds. With these enhanced methods, one could incidentally delve into more fundamental questions such as the role of competing long- and short-range correlations in hidden states and metastable states. One could also examine the role of order parameter fluctuations in nonthermal phase transitions beyond tdGL.",128084,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
NURBS - Nuclear Reaction model improvement with Bayesian Statistics,"Here we aim at improving the modeling of an important type of nuclear reactions - spallation - by estimating and reducing errors and uncertainties with the help of experimental data and by using Bayesian statistics.Spallation is a high-energy nuclear reaction, in which a target nucleus is struck by an incident particle of energy greater than some 10th of MeV. The incident particles can be, for example, nucleons or pions. In this nonelastic process, numerous light particles are ejected. The light particles can be mesons, neutrons or light charged particles (lcps), i.e., protons and/or various composite particles, such as 2H, 3He, and 4He. As the result of the interaction, one or several lighter residual nuclei are produced. Spallation reactions have been studied for a long time not only to better understand the fundamental mechanisms involved but also because they are of major importance for various applications.Considering the applications. At the low energies relevant for nuclear power plants, all nuclear reactions, which are in this case only neutron-induced reactions, could be measured. However, for spallation reactions at higher incident energies and induced by other projectile types (mesons, lcps), measuring all required data is impossible and nuclear models able to predict the relevant data are needed.Historically, the idea of how to describe the basic reaction mechanism for spallation reactions, which is now called intranuclear cascade (INC), was first proposed by Serber (1947). He suggested that at energies of about 100 MeV, the de Broglie wavelength of the incident particle becomes comparable to, or even shorter than, typical internucleon distances within the atomic nuclei, which are in the range 10^-15 m. Consequently, the collision time between the projectile and the nucleons, i.e., the protons and neutrons in the nucleus, becomes shorter than the typical interaction time between the nucleons in the nucleus. This fact permits to consider the interaction of the projectile with the atomic nucleus as consecutive individual collisions between individual nucleons. Shortly after the formulation of the theory, Goldberger (1948) was the first to use Serber’s approach to perform real (analytical) calculations. About 10 years later, Metropolis et al. (1958) and Dostrovsky et al. (1958) were the first to perform extensive computer calculations.Since then, various INC models have been developed, all of them using Monte Carlo methods and all of them with numerous refinements and extensions to the original spallation approach. Depending on the considered projectiles and their energies, some models can be applied to a certain problem, some others not. Typically, all codes have low and high energy limits for their application, though these limits are often difficult to determine. The upper energy limit is often given by additional degrees of freedom that must be considered when going to such high energies, like resonances, new mesons (strange or not), and production of multiple pions. The upper energy limit of a given code then depends on whether such processes are implemented or not. Low-energy limits are often more difficult to constrain. For example, it has been argued for a long time that the low-energy limit for INC models should be in the energy range 100-200 MeV. However, it has been demonstrated that some INC models can be applied to much lower energies than anticipated (Yariv et al. 2008). For the transition to low energies, some codes implement a pre-equilibrium phase while others give reliable results without implementing pre-equilibrium, i.e., with a direct transfer from the INC phase to the equilibrium phase (e.g., David 2015).Understanding and describing the intranuclear cascade is only half of the task necessary for modeling spallation reactions; the other half is modeling the so-called de-excitation phase. The INC phase stops once the remaining energy is homogeneously distributed in the remnant, i.e., once equilibration is achieved. In this state, the remnant nucleus is highly excited. De-excitation is possible via particle evaporation, fission, gamma-ray cascades, and others. Like for the INC part, several different models, like Abla, GEM, GEMINI++, SMM (for more information and references see David and Leya 2019), have been developed to tackle this part and also similar to the INC models, the different models cover different physical aspects. Here we focus on the model combination INCL++6/Abla, which is by far one of the most accurate and reliable systems for describing spallation reactions (e.g., David 2015). The current version INCL++6 is able to reliably handle meson-, hadron-, and light-ion (A=18)-induced reactions and is also able to properly treat the emission of light ions up to mass number A = 8 (Mancusi et al. 2014 and Hirtz et al. 2018, 2020). With the multiple pion emission capability (Pedoux 2011) and the addition of strange particles into INCL, the applicability of the code could be extended to energies in the range of about 20 GeV. The current Abla version describes the de-excitation of a nuclear system by emitting gamma-rays, neutrons, light-charged particles, and intermediate-mass fragments (IMFs). In addition, Abla also describes fission in case of hot and heavy remnants. For more information see Rodríguez-Sánchez et al. (2022). The choice of this model combination relies on the fact that INCL and Abla try to limit the number of free parameters and to be as closely as possible to the underlying physics.",127003,2024,2027,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Spain,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Synchrotrons and Accelerators
Probing Exoplanet Atmospheres: Harnessing the Synergy of JWST and High-Resolution Spectrographs,"In recent years, exoplanets’ atmospheres (hereafter called exo-atmospheres) have ignited a profound interest in their study due to the insights into the compositions, climate, and potential habitability they can provide. As the next generation of space-based observatories, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) promises groundbreaking capabilities in probing exoplanet atmospheres in the near-infrared spectral range. However, JWST alone will not fully exploit the richness that exo-atmospheres have to offer. Although, combining it with high-resolution spectrographs might reveal critical to perform the most in-depth atmospheric characterization. This ambitious research proposal seeks to leverage the unique strengths of JWST and ground-based high-resolution spectrographs to investigate the atmospheres of the best exoplanets gems. The key objective of this research is twofold: First, to capitalize on JWST's infrared capabilities, including its sensitivity to perform transmission spectroscopy during exoplanetary transits. These observations will enable the detection of absorption features caused by the planet's atmosphere. Second, to complement JWST data with high-resolution spectroscopy obtained from advanced ground-based instruments, such as the Near-Infrared Planet Searcher (NIRPS). The high-resolution spectra will provide critical details on the composition, vertical structure, and dynamics of exo-atmospheres. The Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iREx) at Université de Montréal (UdeM) has directly contributed to the conception of both instruments and currently contributes to their scientific exploitation making it the perfect place to do this Mobility project.The research strategy will focus on the puffy warm-Saturn planet WASP-127b observed by both JWST and NIRPS consortia, of which I am a member and have been granted the data analysis of WASP-127b. The combined dataset from JWST and NIRPS using the Starships atmospheric retrieval framework will facilitate a comprehensive atmospheric analysis. Constraints on the atmospheric composition, vertical structures, and dynamics should be delivered with this project. Moreover, key information on the formation and evolution of WASP-127b will be fulfilled.Overall, this Mobility fellowship application aims at robustly settling a novel research framework that harnesses the synergy between JWST and high-resolution spectrographs, unlocking unprecedented opportunities to study exoplanet atmospheres and enriching the field of exoplanetary science.

Algebraic structures arising from the BV-BFV formulation of Gravity,In this project I plan to explore the relations between different En-algebras arising from BV and BFV theories using the techniques proper to functorial field theory.Another structure that will be investigated is related to the P-infinity structures arising from BV the data associated to a corner induced from a BV-BFV theory defined on a manifold with boundary and corners.,120922,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics
Research in Gravitational and Mathematical Astrophysics,"This award supports studies of mathematical and computational analysis methods to advance our scientific understanding of gravitational interaction. This study will focus on a series of problems where strong gravitational fields play an interesting role in a variety of astrophysical situations. These include studies of the properties of neutron stars, black holes, gravitational waves, and the large-scale structure of the universe itself. The new insights discovered by this project could have impacts in a wide range of scientific areas that extend well beyond gravitational astrophysics. This research on neutron-star physics should lead to more accurate methods of measuring the detailed properties of the extremely high-density material inside neutron stars. These results could have an impact on earth-based laboratory nuclear physics, in addition to its contribution to astrophysics. This project will also develop new computational methods for performing simulations of gravitational effects on the large-scale structure and evolution of the entire universe. These methods will provide advances in the field of computational mathematics. Some of these research projects are likely to involve undergraduate and graduate students, and will therefore contribute to the development of the next generation of scientists. New research will be conducted that will allow observations of neutron stars and our understanding of strong gravitational fields to be used to determine the neutron-star equation of state in a way that is free from any assumptions about the microphysics of neutron star matter. The projects include work in numerical relativity that involves developing techniques for solving Einstein's equations on manifolds with arbitrary spatial topologies. These methods will be used to study a variety of problems, including an effort to explore the gravitational analog of the turbulent cascade seen in fluid systems, and exploring cosmological models numerically to determine whether and how non-trivial topology could be recognized through observations.

RUI: New Observables for de Sitter Quantum Gravity,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Claire Zukowski at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Quantum physics has successfully described the constituents of matter at subatomic scales. On the other hand, Einstein’s theory of gravity dominates the behavior of matter at the largest known scales in our universe. While it is well-tested at large scales, gravity is the only known force for which we do not know the quantum description. There are regimes where one is needed: for instance, deep inside a black hole or shortly after the Big Bang, when our entire gravitating universe was compressed within a tiny region. A theory of quantum gravity aims to fill in these gaps in our fundamental understanding of the universe, but is most tractable in models that do not describe our actual universe. In this project, Professor Zukowski will study quantum gravity in a setting that approximates our known universe. The research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science through an understanding of physical laws. The work will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Zukowski will train both undergraduate and master’s students in this field of research, providing crucial support for their education and career development. She will also give lectures aimed at high school students and the general public about recent developments in quantum gravity. More technically, Professor Zukowski will study quantum gravity in de Sitter spacetime. Using standard techniques in holography as a starting point, she will apply quantum information theoretic tools such as modular Berry transport and complexity to probe bulk geometry. While traditional dS/CFT has presented challenges for generalizing holography beyond asymptotically AdS spacetimes, new avenues are opened by recent developments in Chern-Simons gravity. Professor Zukowski will use these methods to compute new quantum observables for de Sitter. Finally, the project will also connect to cosmology through a further study of the landscape. Performing general warped compactifications and applying a new bootstrap technique for compactifications will constrain the low-energy landscape for quantum gravity.

Precision Tests of Einstein's Equations with Axisymmetric Numerical Relativity,"This award supports a new research initiative, which will use the techniques of numerical relativity to model black hole formation and explore possible consequences for astrophysical observations. This effort is complementary to the work of a recently formed Utah LIGO group, and will enhance collaboration with gravitational researchers both within and external to the University of Utah. The work will be carried out by the PI in conjunction with both graduate and undergraduate students, as problems in numerical relativity are excellent training grounds in both modern physics research and state-of-the-art computational techniques. The PI will continue to maintain an affiliation with departmental outreach programs that conduct direct outreach to groups underrepresented in the sciences including rural schools in Utah and Montana. The observation of gravitational waves by the LIGO and VIRGO interferometers is among the greatest scientific achievements of the twenty-first century, simultaneously confirming one of Einstein's most elusive predictions and opening a new window into the study of astrophysical processes. At the same time, these successes created new motivation to probe the foundations of General Relativity, which is known to be an incomplete picture of nature. In most cases of interest, it is necessary to bring the techniques of numerical relativity to bear on the simultaneous solution of ten independent Einstein equations in four-dimensional spacetime. These solutions may either predict observations or serve as a laboratory for ""thought experiments"" in which exotic spacetimes are tested to understand the limitations of the theory. One such laboratory is the study of critical phenomena that occur in spacetimes near the black hole creation threshold. Previous work by the Utah Numerical Relativity group has focused on competing critical collapse of scalar fields in spherical symmetry, in which the interplay between several stress-energy sources may tend to enhance or frustrate the collapse of the system. Under this award, the group will extend these studies to axisymmetric systems to test whether the competing collapse phenomenon persists in more generic systems, and if so, what the consequences might be for primordial black hole formation and other observables. In a related parallel effort, we are applying new computational techniques to the historically difficult problem of the collapse of vacuum gravitational waves.

Volcanism and atmospheric evolution on rocky exoplanets: Investigating potentially observable trends,"Modern-day astronomical instruments, such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and soon the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), allow for observations of rocky exoplanets to a never-before-seen level of detail. These observations include low-level characterization of the atmosphere, and in case of an absent atmosphere, bare rocky surface spectra (Wordsworth and Kreidberg, 2022). On rocky planets, the interior, surface, and atmosphere are continuously interacting with each other, but the exchange between these planetary subsystems in a general picture is poorly constrained (Chao+, 2021; Lichtenberg+, 2022). To interpret rocky exoplanet observations, we require robust numerical and theoretical tools to study this interaction and compare to observational data.In my earlier work, I have studied a previously under-explored aspect of the rocky planet system: the connection between bulk interior composition and stellar elemental abundances (Spaargaren+, 2023). Rocky planets share a genetic compositional link with their host star, and stellar abundances are widely available for most stellar types. The interior composition of a rocky planet determines both the size of the metallic iron core and mantle mineralogy, which both control thermal and dynamical evolution of the planetary interior. I have established that a diversity of bulk interior compositions translates to different volatile outgassing and ingassing behaviour (Spaargaren+, 2020), and therefore affects atmospheric evolution.With the SNSF Postdoc.Mobility fellowship, I will expand my previous work on representative rocky exoplanet compositions and detailed geodynamic models (Spaargaren+, in prep) to establish how interior composition affects potential observables of rocky exoplanets: the composition of a bare rocky surface, and the size and composition of secondary atmospheres on geologic timescales. To this end, I will constrain the ranges of plausible surface mineralogy and mantle melting behaviour with a robust petrological model. I will then implement the obtained melting behaviour and surface composition in a geodynamical model coupled to a grey-gas atmospheric model, to investigate the long-term evolution of the atmosphere coupled to the rocky interior.My research will provide an avenue to a more generalized framework of rocky planetary evolution, resolving the intrinsic link between stellar composition, planetary tectonics, and atmosphere-interior coupling. To distinguish modeling predictions with astronomical observations, I will provide diagnostic tools that link stellar spectroscopic abundances with climate evolution scenarios, to help interpret atmospheric observations of rocky exoplanets.",119908,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences; Space Sciences
Modern theoretical tools for interpreting hidden particle searches,"The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is one of the most successful theories in the history of science, being a unified description of all particles that have been observed to date. Nevertheless, there are some unresolved problems, including the observed abundance of dark matter and that neutrinos are not massless, that clearly point to the existence of new physics beyond the SM. Many promising new physics models postulate light hidden particles like axion-like particles (ALPs), heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), or dark photons to explain these problems, and there are many ongoing and prospective experiments that can search for such particles. Besides the high-intensity CMS and ATLAS data sets, meson physics experiments such as PIONEER, NA62, KOTO, LHCb, and Belle II yield some of the most competitive constraints. A range of future experiments with definite funding commitments, including FASER and DUNE, will further augment these constraints, and there are many proposed experiments, such as MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, SHiP, and SHADOWS, designed with a primary focus on hidden particle searches. The large variety of viable new particles is a challenge for the model-independent interpretation of these searches. Effective field theories (EFTs) are theoretical tools that can help address this challenge, but they typically suppose a minimalist hidden sector with only one or two new particles, and it is often difficult to map EFT constraints on to more complex, realistic hidden sectors. Given the importance of new particle searches for modern high-energy physics, there is an urgent need to fill this gap. I therefore propose this project to develop a modern infrastructure of theoretical tools that interface model-independent but minimalist EFTs with realistic hidden sectors.In prior research, I put forward a novel approach to factorize generic hidden particle production rates that systematically parametrizes our ignorance about the internal structure of hidden sectors. I also developed a framework for constructing portal effective theories (PETs), which are EFTs that couple SM particles to generic hidden sectors, and applied this framework to describe decays of light pseudoscalar mesons (pions, kaons, and eta-mesons). In combination, these techniques are the foundation of a modern infrastructure for interpreting new particle searches, but significant additional work is necessary to make them useful in practice. To this end, I will implement the following three work packages (WP): In WP 1, I will develop a software tool to automatically extract new physics constraints from light pion, kaon, and eta-meson decays, and then apply this tool to constrain some of the most promising benchmark models involving e.g. ALPs, HNLs, and dark photons. In WP 2, I will construct PETs that couple heavy D and B mesons and nucleons to generic new particles. This will lay the groundwork to extend the interpretation infrastructure beyond light meson decays. In WP 3, I will investigate how to factorize rates of processes that do not produce but rather involve initial state hidden particles, and explore how to model-independently combine constraints from various different energy scales. This will make it possible to apply the infrastructure to e.g. direct searches for dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta decays, and function as a first step to model-independently combine constraints from experiments at various energy scales.Once completed, this project will provide a minimum viable infrastructure that can quickly and easily constrain diverse hidden sectors. This will be a crucial help to search for some of the most promising but elusive new particle candidates, including ALPs, HNLs, and dark photons.",119906,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
"Swiss contribution to BlueMUSE, third generation integral field spectrograph for ESO/VLT","BlueMUSE is an optical seeing-limited, blue-optimised, medium spectral resolution, panoramic integral-field-spectrograph, to be installed on one of the telescopes of the VLT on Cerro Paranal (Chile). The instrument is an evolution of the technology used on the very successful VLT / MUSE instrument, with a similar architecture and many similar systems, but with a new and distinct science case enabled by its main characteristics: a wavelength coverage 350 - 580 nm; an average spectral resolution R=3500.BlueMUSE will offer new and unique science opportunities in many fields of astrophysics, beyond those possible with MUSE. Among the science goals available with this new instrument, it will survey large sample of massive stars in our galaxy and the Local Group, study ionized nebulae, starburst and low surface-brightness galaxies. At high redshift, it will allow us for the first time to detect the IGM unambiguously in emission, as well as study the evolution of the CGM properties near the peak of the Cosmic Star formation history. This funding will cover the pre-phase A study, during which EPFL will build devices to re-align the relay mirrors of BlueMUSE with precision requirements, and UNIGE will design and budget the FORE-optics, with a field-of view of 1 arcmin, finally.",119717,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland; Switzerland,Switzerland,Astronomical Sciences
RUI: Measurement of the Ionization Energy of Lithium 6 and 7,"The fundamental purpose of atomic physics is to understand the complex interactions and inner workings of the atom. This project will further our knowledge of the lithium atom and test one sector of our best theoretical model, known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Our knowledge of atomic systems is driven by both experimental and theoretical results. This project aims to resolve a discrepancy between previous measurements of the ionization energy of lithium-7 and make a second measurement for the ionization energy of lithium-6. Ionization energy is an important parameter that can serve as a test of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, measurements of the ionization energy can be useful for confirming theoretical calculations that are used in experiments that identify and explore changes in the nuclear charge distribution for the short-lived radioisotopes of lithium. This research takes place at a liberal arts college and will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the work, training the next generation of scientists and engineers. In addition to work on the home campus of Assumption College, some of the work will take place at Smith College to take advantage of advanced laser equipment available there, including some enabled by a recent Major Research Instrumentation award from NSF. This work will develop the students’ proficiencies in experimental physics which are highly transferable to a range a careers and future work. In addition, the PI will offer workshops that aim to develop physicists’ facility to engage in critical conversations in the classroom and research environments. The PI and her students will measure the absolute transition frequencies of a large number of nS, nP, and nD states in neutral lithium-7 and lithium-6 from n = 10 to the ionization threshold to sub-MHz precision. The experiment will utilize Rydberg spectroscopy through the ionization threshold directly from the ground state, with all laser frequencies calibrated by a frequency comb. Spectroscopy on the nP states will be performed with a single photon from the ground state between 236 nm and 230 nm. The nS and nD states will be explored through off-resonance two photon transitions between 472 nm and 460 nm, again directly from the ground state. The project will resolve experimental discrepancies in current reported values. Quantum interference effects on the 2s 2S1/2 → 2p 2P3/2 states will be explored.

Deciphering building blocks of planetary systems with multi-wavelength multi-instrument observations,"Dust in protoplanetary disks are important building blocks of planets. Their properties define the planet chemical composition and the course of the planet formation. Only until the operation of the current generation of high contrast imagers and the interferometers are we able to spatially resolve the dust in planet-forming disks to study their properties. Thanks to these state-of-the-art telescopes (e.g., VLT, HST, JWST, VLTI, ALMA), we can now study dust in different regimes and spatial extents through: IR thermal emission from the hot dust close to the star (0.1-10 au), visual to near-IR scattered light from the dust at the disk surface further out (>10 au), and (sub-)millimeter emission of the large grains settled to the disk mid-plane. However, the properties of the dust in different regions of these disks remain not well-known. Therefore, we lack important information for our understanding of the planet formation. To tackle this problem, I propose to conduct multi-wavelength study that is only enabled recently from multi-instrument observations. The comprehensive study offers the promising way to combine the advantages of instruments and to elucidate the nature of the planet-forming materials - dust.In the first project, I will combine high-contrast imaging data of the reflected light from 0.5 to 2.2 µm by ZIMPOL and IRDIS at VLT/SPHERE. I led a multi-national ESO/VLT observing program for HD 100453 disk - a prototypical companion-disk interaction system hosting a pair of spirals and a substellar companion - at four wavelengths. I will continue the lead in analyzing the high-quality data obtained in March 2023, aiming to (i) obtain accurate measurements of the disk intensity and the degree of polarization at multi-wavelength; (ii) characterize the dust properties in the disk ring and the companion-driven spiral arms; (iii) search for the radial dependencies of dust scattering properties within the outer disk. Through this work, we will obtain the first evidence for different dust scattering properties in resolved disk substructures, gaining an unprecedented understanding of the interactions between the disks and companions. Based on this exemplary work, I will lead a multi-wavelength survey to systematically study planet-forming disks.In the second project, I will lead analyzing interferometric data from 3 to 13 µm observed by VLTI/MATISSE, a critical wavelength offered by this new instrument, and conduct a joint analysis together with the corresponding SPHERE imaging datasets. The mid-IR wavelength probes the emission of hot dust not resolved in the reflection and complements the observation of the disk. Being actively involved in the MATISSE consortium, IPAG the host institution gives me the unique opportunity to participate in the guaranteed time observations (GTO) disk science team, and guarantees my access to the acquired datasets of MWC 758. This project is designed to (i) constrain the inner disk geometry and characterize the hot dust with interferometric data; (ii) identify the spectral features and determine the radial dependence of the dust composition (e.g. ice, silicate, and carbon) with spectral data; (iii) investigate the inner disk’s shadowing effect on the outer disk combining with imaging data. This multi-instrument analysis allows us to compare and connect the dust in the hot region close to the star and the dust in the cold region further away and study the interaction between the inner and outer disks.With both projects offering pioneering work enabled by state-of-the-art instruments, I will offer important insights into determining the radial dependencies of dust properties for different exemplary protoplanetary disks. This is only available from a combination of my expertise and IPAG unique access, from both direct imaging and spectro-interferometric datasets. We will reveal systematic effects on dust under different physical conditions, such as dust temperatures (within or beyond the snow line), stellar irradiation (stellar wind), or interactions (with companions and/or planets), which can ultimately elucidate the dust evolution process to help better understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems.",117654,2024,2026,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Space Sciences
Bio-Inspired Photonic Crystals from Lipidic Lyotropic Liquid Crystals,"This project investigates how structural colour (photonic crystals) is created in nature, e.g. in the pupae of butterflies. Research in recent decades has mainly focused on analysing which photonic structures occur in nature, for example in arthropods and birds, and investigating their optical mechanisms. However, it is still not clear how these highly complex photonic structures are formed. One of the formation hypotheses is that the structures are formed by self-organisation of lipidic lyotropic liquid crystals. Lipidic lyotropic liquid crystals are mainly used for drug delivery, but their structure sizes are in the order of a few tenths of a nanometre. In this project, we want to investigate how the structure sizes can be increased to photonic dimensions (several hundred nanometres). Our aim is not only to investigate the formation process of photonic crystals in butterflies and beetles, but also to develop sustainable, brilliant pigments for the cosmetics and food industries in the future.",112487,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Classical Physics
Moiré Patterns as Universal Epitaxial Template,"The isolation of graphene in 2004 had a worldwide impact way beyond the expectations. Each significant advancements in the understanding of the atomic and band structures of graphene lead to unforeseen discoveries in the domain of fundamental and applied material science. Noteworthy examples are the isolation of hundreds of 2D material families, the identification of Dirac materials as well as applications as mechanical reinforcement and sensing electrode. Recently, bilayer graphene has attracted the attention of the scientific community for the unique quantum states arising when twisting two graphene monolayers with respect to each other. Such a twisted superposition forms a planar super-lattice (called Moiré pattern) with a characteristic length dependent on the twist angle. The tunable periodicity of the Moiré patterns appears as a unique opportunity to achieve tailored templates for high-quality semiconductor, potentially leading to another graphene-related breakthrough in material science.  This project envisions the first ever application of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for epitaxial growth of semiconductor crystals (Moiré epitaxy). Epitaxy can provide crystals with the highest quality provided that the difference between the lattice constants of the material to be grown and of the substrate material is small. Otherwise defects are formed, and the crystal quality deteriorates together with the functional properties of the grown material. The lattice-matching requirement is the reason why semiconductor compounds can be grown epitaxially only on specific substrates often contain scarce or toxic elements. This is a strong limitation at the industrial level, as it compels a quality/cost trade off. The development of a cheap substrate enabling the growth of multiple semiconductor compounds with high quality (thus universal) would revolutionize the semiconductor sector with a major impact on the entire market. This project proposes to use Moiré patterns with different twist angles as a template to mimic the periodicity required to achieve lattice matching for semiconductor compound, thus obtaining a universal substrate for epitaxial growth (Figure 1). The project will combine the control over the twist angle of graphene bilayers, placed on inert and cheap substrates, with the epitaxy of III-V and II-V compounds. The development of such a growth method will open completely new perspectives in electronic, optoelectronic and photonic sectors, prompting both device efficiency enhancement and transition to sustainable materials at once.",112479,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
"A hole or not a hole: Examining the role of hole-carriers, density of states, and phonons on superconductivity","The success of the BCS theory of superconductivity has been one of the great cornerstones of theoretical condensed matter physics in the 20th century. Within BCS theory, the attractive interaction of Cooper pairs is explained by a lattice distortion and thus intimately connected to the phonon spectrum of a superconductor. Extensions of the BCS theory, formalized within the Eliashberg theory, include lattice retardation effects and electron-phonon coupling strength. Together, they are portrayed as providing a universal explanation of conventional superconductors. However, with the advent of high-temperature superconductors, the phonon picture could not explain the new classes of “unconventional” superconductors or rationalize their high critical temperatures. In consequence,  a plethora of new pairing mechanisms were devised. A valid question arises whether the many classes of unconventional and possibly even conventional superconductors could perhaps be explained by a common theory. Jorge Hirsch, most famously know for the introduction of the h-index and bearing his name, also uncovered curious correlations between normal state properties of materials and them becoming superconducting upon cooling. He found in the Hall coefficient the most significant predictor for whether a material would superconduct. More precisely, a material would have a much higher chance of becoming a superconductor when it had a positive Hall coefficient. From elementary solid state lectures, we know that the sign of the Hall coefficient is connected to the charge of the carriers, meaning that a positive Hall coefficient would points towards hole conductivity. Hirsch accordingly suggested the concept of “hole-superconductivity” as the common theme for all superconductors. As Hirsch has become quite vocal in his posture on this alternative theory of superconductivity, the community dismissed the statements and little experimental effort has been dedicated to testing some of the predictions of hole-superconductivity. Here we propose some straightforward experimental tests that could corroborate or refute hole superconductivity by using the simple system Be(0001). This material is barely a superconductor with a critical temperature Tc as low as 24 mK. The low Tc is notable because according to BCS, it would have all the feats of an ideal superconductor: strong electron-phonon coupling, large Debye energy, and low ionic mass. If the BCS concepts applied to beryllium, it should be easy to modify Tc by changing the chemical potential. Curiously, Be also has a positive Hall coefficient and could fall under Hirsch’s theory of superconductivity, making this system an ideal testbed for this study. Our approach thus consists of 1. tuning the chemical potential by the adsorption of alkali metals to change the density of states at the Fermi level and 2. creating hole-like bands close to the Fermi level. The new periodicity of the adlayer will back fold the Be surface state at the reduced zone boundary and open an interaction gap which also creates hole-like carriers. In addition, we can test Hirsch’s predictions by inspecting gap function asymmetries by performing tunneling spectroscopy between normal and superconducting states and measure the thermoelectric voltage of a tunneling junction. Our experiments will provide a fresh take at the pairing mechanism of superconductivity or refute a controversial explanation; both highly valuable outcomes for the community.",112395,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Condensed Matter Physics
New insights into quantum materials by localized excitation in ultrafast electron microscopy,"As current technology reaches its limits and an energy crisis looms, humanity needs new ways to store data efficiently. Quantum materials offer an exciting opportunity to develop nanoscale, long-lived and energy-efficient data storage. These materials have unique nanoscale magnetic structures, called skyrmions, which are controllable on very short timescales and could be used to store and retrieve information with unprecedented speed and efficiency. However, for this technology to reach maturity, we must first develop a detailed understanding of these materials and their behaviour at very fast time and very small spatial scales. The goal of this project is to understand the behaviour of skyrmions in a new way by exciting small pockets of them with a very short laser pulse while simultaneously imaging them inside a transmission electron microscope with high time resolution. To do this we have to focus the laser pulses to smaller spot sizes than has previously been achieved. We will achieve this by developing a new fibre based laser delivery system within the electron microscope.Using this new laser pulse delivery system will enable new experiments and provide key insights into the physics of skyrmions, creating previously unseen behaviour. This behaviour has technological implications because future devices will operate on the micro- to nanometer scale where this behaviour is relevant. The impact of the work proposed will be immediate and long-lasting.  The new insights gained will lead to a deeper understanding of skyrmions and how they can be used for data storage.",111432,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Quantum Physics
Homological Mirror Symmetry and Fukaya Categories from a Toric Perspective,"Interesting and impactful mathematics often arises when new connections are made between different fields of math. While even heuristic connections can be fruitful, mirror symmetry provides a fascinating direct connection, originating from modern physics, between algebraic geometry and symplectic topology that has led to major advances in both areas. Algebraic geometry is a rich and classical field of mathematics that explores shapes called algebraic varieties described by polynomial equations. Symplectic topology is a younger area that studies shapes built from a geometric formalism for classical mechanics by packaging solutions to certain partial differential equations into algebraic invariants. This project aims to deepen our understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomenon by building on new insights in a special case where the algebraic varieties are particularly symmetric. This will be done with the aim of verifying new cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture, exploring structural aspects of a symplectic invariant known as the Fukaya category, and investigating arithmetic aspects of mirror symmetry. The project will also involve undergraduate research projects on combinatorial problems coming from mirror symmetry. The first technical goal of the project is to further develop functorial aspects of the toric homological mirror symmetry equivalence by enlarging the list of sheaves and functors that can be provably described in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds and geometric operations on them. These geometric functors will give a better understanding of homological mirror symmetry for singular varieties obtained by gluing toric varieties along toric strata, which can then be deformed to obtain new cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture. In the other direction, the project will seek to leverage the geometric flexibility of the Fukaya category to construct new group actions on derived categories of toric varieties. The project will also aim to determine when symplectic fibrations can be described in terms of cornered Liouville sectors resulting in a gluing formula for their Fukaya categories. Finally, the project will explore the extent to which the toric Frobenius morphism and its simple geometric description on the mirror can be extended to other classes of varieties with an eye towards generation time in the derived category. This project is jointly funded by Topology and Geometric Analysis program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",111345,2024,2027,NSF,United States,United States,Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Physics; Pure Mathematics
Advancing particle therapy: Spatially-resolved dose and LET measurements for improved treatment outcome,"Particle therapy using ions offers both physical and biological advantages over conventional radiotherapy with photons. The ionisation density along the particle’s trajectory, generally parameterised through the linear energy transfer (LET), highly impacts both the radiobiological and physical responses. High-LET particles have high biological effectiveness due to their dense cluster lesions, which enables a sparing of the healthy tissue surrounding the tumour. Particularly, this enhanced biological effectiveness makes it essential to ensure a high degree of dose conformity and that high-LET particles do not stop in healthy tissue or organs. Unfortunately, the current quality assurance in ion beams is challenged by the absence of a detector for spatial LET measurements, and dose measurements are undertaken with a coarse spatial resolution.This project seeks to demonstrate the first simultaneous dose and LET measurements with a high spatial resolution. The first experimental validations of simulated dose and LET distributions will be conducted in a clinically relevant study where the tumour is situated next to the radiation-sensitive brain stem. Radiation toxicity and necrosis in the brain stem have been observed in several cases of particle therapy of tumours located next to the brain stem, indicating that current quality assurance is insufficient. To address this lack of experimental validations and to improve patient specific quality assurance, we seek to answer to the question: Can the first detector for spatially-resolved dose and LET measurements improve patient outcome?In contrast to the groups worldwide currently working towards a spatial LET detector using semiconductorbased technologies, this project takes an unconventional approach of using a flexible plastic film coated with crystalline materials. Due to its rapidity and high risk, this project is unlikely to be funded under other SNF schemes. However, if realised, it has a high gain potential as the results can also be applied outside the scope of quality assurance. It will enable experimental validations in pre-clinical radiobiological studies, where the effects of dose and LET are studied, and support future particle therapy studies.The project consists of three phases, with the first two running concurrently to demonstrate simultaneous dose and LET measurements in reference conditions with a system using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Although each technology required for this project is separately well-established, significant uncertainties arise when combining them for spatial measurements. Consequently, there is high risk due to the many unknowns, e.g. when the current available OSL materials may not provide the necessary spatial resolution or LET sensitivity. Nonetheless, even if this project does not succeed, it will identify these limitations and guide future researchtowards developing appropriate OSL films for LET measurements.The third phase involves the study of the LET and dose distribution near the brain stem using an anthropomorphic head phantom that closely resembles the shape and tissue characteristics of a human head. The phantom will enable the insertion of the OSL film in a plane through the fictional tumour and brain stem.  If these experimental LET and dose measurements agree with the simulated ones within the limits relevant to particle therapy, this will constitute the first spatially-resolved experimental validations of a treatment plan. Hence, the project has the potential to improve patient-specific quality assurance in particle therapy and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",110975,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Search for new physics and technological advancement from neutrino experiments at the high intensity frontier. A cooperative Europe US Brazil Effort.,"SENSE promotes the collaboration among European, American and Brazilian researchers involved in the most important research projects in the field of neutrino physics. The observation of neutrino oscillations is the first direct evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model and their existence can have cosmological implications. Are neutrinos partly responsible for the existence of our matter dominated Universe for example? The current experimental landscape established a picture consistent with the mixing of three neutrino flavours with three mass eigenstates and small mass differences. However, recent experimental anomalies suggest the existence of sterile neutrino states (which do not interact with ordinary matter apart from neutrinos) and could help to explain how neutrinos get their mass as well as being candidates for dark matter and other complex theoretical particles. Neutrino oscillations offer a gateway into other possible deviations from the Standard Model. In [articular in the lepton sector including Charged Lepton Flavour Violation. 

The FNAL Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program is based on three almost identical liquid argon Time Projection Chambers located along the Booster Neutrino Beam offers a compelling opportunity to resolve the anomalies and perform the most sensitive search for sterile neutrinos at the eV mass scale through appearance and disappearance oscillation searches. MicroBooNE, ICARUS and SBND will search for the oscillation signal by comparing the neutrino event spectra measured at different distances from the source. The FNAL SBN program is a major step towards the global effort of the neutrino physics community in realising the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) which will provide fundamental contribution to the determination of neutrino mass ordering, measurement of CP violation (which if non zero could mean neutrinos are at least in part responsible for the matter anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe), precision tests of the three-flavour oscillation paradigm using long-baseline flavour transition, search for nucleon decay and study of the burst of neutrinos from core-collapse supernova in the framework of multi-messenger astronomy. SENSE researchers have provided major contributions to the SBN and DUNE projects and will take leading roles in the commissioning of the detectors, data taking and analysis. These endeavours foster the development of cutting-edge technologies with spin-offs outside particle physics.",110268,2024,2028,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Nuclear and Plasma Physics; Particle and High Energy Physics
Matter for Dark Matter detection,"Dark Matter remains the most elusive substance in the known Universe. On one side, its existence seems strongly supported by several astrophysical observations. On the other, no direct or indirect measurements have so far succeeded in its detection.To this aim, the next generation of detectors is being now developed. Semiconductor and noble liquid targets display promising performance for dark matter energies mX in the MeV - GeV regime. The light mass regime mX < MeV, though attractive theoretically, is instead experimentally much more challenging due to the low amount of energies deposited in the targets.  Proposals for detectors using superconducting targets, Dirac materials, or molecular magnets suffer either from low sensitivity or difficulties in large-scale synthesis.Recently, scattering of DM by phonon modes in polar materials was proposed as a viable alternative /cite{griffin2018directional}. In particular, sapphire (a-Al2O3) was suggested as a promising candidate. The interaction between DM and phonons is, in the assumption of a light field mediator (e.g. a dark photon), proportional to a well-known property of solids: electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Sapphire is anticipated to host strong EPC and is suited for large-scale, high-quality production. Additionally, the EPC of high-energy optical modes is predicted to be strongly anisotropic along different crystal directions. Exploiting the daily rotation of Earth, this property could be used to modulate the signal of sapphire detectors and increase their performance.Determining the sensitivity of potential sapphire detectors requires, therefore, a precise estimation of the EPC of its phonon branches. We propose here to realize the first measurement of the strength of EPC in sapphire and quantify its anisotropy along inequivalent crystal axes. To do so, we will use Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS), a synchrotron-based, inelastic scattering technique. In the last five years, RIXS has become the best method to study EPC in insulating materials. However, its application as a probe for EPC in polar oxides has been so far scarce. Though our study will first focus on sapphire, we also intend to benchmark this material against other polar oxides such as HfO2, ZrO2, and KTaO3, which might possess similar characteristics. These experiments will provide the electron-phonon coupling of optical phonon modes across the family of polar oxides. Our study will determine which material has the largest electron phonon coupling (on a relative scale) and displays the strongest anisotropy. This is crucial information for the design of future fermionic dark matter detectors. Overall, this project aims at using our expertise in experimental condensed matter physics to provide innovative contribution to the search of dark matter, bridging two seemingly far branches of physics.",105902,2024,2024,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Nuclear and Plasma Physics
Normating colour-centre-based quantum sensing technology towards industrial application and standards,"Solid-state quantum sensors (QSs) have the potential to measure several physical quantities with unprecedented spatial resolution and high sensitivity. As such, they are emerging candidates for potential applications in a plethora of fields e. g. high precision electric magnetic and radiofrequency measurements, gravimetry, climate research, hydrocarbon and mineral exploration, navigation, medicine (brain imaging, heart imaging) and metrology. Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centres are photoluminescent point defects in diamond, which have high potential for future uptake as they present the highest Technology Readiness Level (TRL) amongst solid state atomic-scale sensors. However, standardised methods which would enable the adoption of solid-state quantum sensors, in particular NV centres, are still missing. This project aims to address this need by developing standardised techniques for the creation and characterisation QSs based primarily on NV centres in diamond for nanoscale and high sensitivity sensing of electromagnetic fields, temperature or pressure. This will be done in synergy with the needs expressed by CEN-CLC JTC-22 to promote early uptake of the project outputs and foster future uptake of novel solutions, including colour centres in other bulk or 2-D semiconductor materials (e. g. Si, SiC, hBN).",104418,2024,2027,UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"Engineering; Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; Quantum Physics"
Nonlinear Interaction of Terahertz Light with Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials,"Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hold great promise for the engineering of modern nanophotonic devices that will operate at terahertz (THz) speed rates, with reduced energy requirements. Particularly, their nonlinear properties at THz frequencies, are expected to be the key element for the development of THz nanodevices that can generate new frequencies, control light propagation or act as nonlinear optical modulators. The TeraNanoLIGHT project aims to study with nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution, the ultrafast interaction of 2D nanomaterials with atomically strong (multi-MV/cm) THz fields, promoting the light-matter interactions into the non-perturbative regime. Intense THz transients will be combined with a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) to achieve atomically strong fields. Initially, THz surface plasmons (SPs) will be resonantly coupled in graphene, and their nonlinear behavior will be studied by monitoring their formation, propagation and temporal evolution as the THz field strength increases into the nonlinear regime. Furthermore, non-resonant nonlinearities will be explored, exploiting the oscillating THz field as an ultrafast AC bias. The possibility to observe high harmonic generation (HHG) with characteristics similar to those of atomic gases, will be studied in monolayer TMDs and heterostructures of different layers number and twist angles, excited by an out-of-plane polarized THz field. Finally, the opportunity of exploiting the extremely nonlinear interaction of light with matter, to improve the spatial resolution of SNOM, will be investigated. TeraNanoLIGHT project, envisions to facilitate our understanding about the ultrafast interaction of intense THz light with 2D materials and their high-order nonlinearities. This understanding is expected to trigger innovative research on the development of the future THz lightwave electronic devices.",102660,2024,2025,European Commission,Germany,EU,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics
Unlocking nonlinear optical effects by local symmetry breaking,"The rapid growth of advanced photonics applications in optical communications, sensing, quantum optics or imaging naturally calls out for a need in more complex and compact devices. Nonlinear optics, the result of nonlinear dielectric displacement (dipoles) due to light-matter interaction, allows for versatile management of light in a photonic circuit, including frequency conversion and ultra-fast electro-optic (EO) modulation for instance. Silicon nitride (SiNx) currently constitutes one of the main platforms for integrated nonlinear photonics thanks to its compatibility with standard fabrication techniques of the CMOS industry and the ultra-low loss (around 1 dB/m) that can be achieved in nano-scale waveguides. While most of the necessary components for optical communication or quantum optics have been achieved in SiNx, the EO modulator is still a missing, yet essential, building block on this platform. EO modulation is a widely studied topic, mainly in semiconductors exploiting charge distribution to control the refractive index of the material for phase or amplitude modulation. However, this technique is limited in speed due to the resistive and capacitive nature of the device, and can result in distorted signals due to a nonlinear relation between charge distribution and refractive index change. Efficient linear and fast EO modulation can be obtained through Pockels effect - a second order nonlinear optical effect consisting in a proportional dependance of the refractive index with an externally applied electric field - but is only possible in non-centrosymmetric materials like LiNbO3, KTP, PZT or AlN. These materials are not abundant and/or hard to pattern into waveguides, which hinders the possibility of monolithic integration and scalability, necessary for cost-effective technology. By inducing symmetry breaking in amorphous SiNx, Pockels effect can be triggered locally, for example at an interface with a silica layer. Such surface symmetry breaking was already investigated in the past in bulk materials to demonstrate second harmonic generation, proving that a local asymmetry can induce second order nonlinearities. To the best of our knowledge, no demonstration or study has been made on surface induced EO modulation in integrated circuits. This project aims at developing a new way to build EO modulators based on Pockels effect in SiNx integrated waveguides by exploiting local symmetry breaking at interfaces between the waveguide core and its surrounding material. This achievement will make it possible to design and build complete and scalable photonic systems on a single photonic chip compatible with current common fabrication techniques. For that purpose, I will build theoretical and numerical models of surface-induced Pockels effect in integrated waveguides. Then, I will design optimized structures to enhance the effect of local symmetry breaking by using slot waveguides (structure where light is confined in a lower index material in-between two ridges of higher index materials). That way, both optical and driving electrical field will be maximal at the place of the symmetry breaking, contrary to conventional waveguides in which sidewalls are overlapped by evanescent fields. In addition, to avoid global inversion symmetry due to opposing inverted sidewalls, bent waveguides and asymmetric slot waveguides will be studied. Indeed, in these cases the optical mode is “pushed” towards one of the interfaces, then avoiding the cancellation of the effect due to the reversed dipoles created at the opposing interface. I will exploit this unconventional method in ring resonators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers to achieve efficient and fast EO modulation. After fabrication of the devices, I will carry extensive experimental characterization of the optical and electro-optical behaviors of the modulators to corroborate with my model and demonstrate integrated surface-induced Pockels effect for the first time. Based on the experimental results, models will be adjusted, further optimization will be investigated and design rules will be identified. Achieving EO modulation based on Pockels effect in the SiNx platform will fill the technological gap that is currently present for that platform and it will pave the way to new and unconventional ways to build compact and cost-effective photonic integrated circuits for optical communications, sensing and quantum photonics.",101800,2024,2024,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Engineering; Nanotechnology; Quantum Physics
Collaborative Research: The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2,"The team will search for galaxy clusters and protoclusters in the distant Universe, back to the time when the first clusters were forming, allowing for detailed studies of the most massive galaxies in the universe at the time when they were rapidly growing.

Combining the WISE data with catalogs from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on NSF’s Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile will allow the team to determine where the first clusters are forming in a 3D volume of the universe.

Collaborative Research: New Directions in Vortex Dynamics: from Theory and Computation to Physical Experiments,"Vortices are persistent circulating flow patterns that arise in diverse physical contexts, ranging from classical hydrodynamics and superfluids to condensed matter physics and nonlinear optics. They are ubiquitous physical phenomena in the world around us and can be observed at very different scales, from microscopic vortex lines in superfluid liquid helium, to dust devils and tornadoes, and even to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms (BECs) provide a pristine and controllable environment where numerous aspects of the fascinating realm of nonlinear vortex dynamics can be explored not just in theory but also through direct experiments. In addition to their intrinsic fundamental interest, these systems also exhibit localized solutions with potential practical applications: for example, it has been suggested that solitary waves could be used for unprecedented, improved sensitivity in interferometric and force-sensing devices. On the other hand, vortical structures, which are the focus of this proposal, also hold promise for other intriguing applications. For instance, they can provide an instance of 'analogue gravity' as a proxy to study the behavior of spinning black holes. It has also been proposed that BEC vortices could collapse in a manner akin to supermassive black holes and that supersonic expansion in BECs can replicate properties of an expanding universe in laboratory settings. Through a bijective collaboration with experiments, this proposal aims to advance the current understanding of topological structures in BECs. Being based on universal models of modulated waves in nonlinear media, the underlying physical setting represents a fundamental playground to study topologically charged excitations that are, in turn, at the heart of an extremely wide variety of physical contexts in atomic, optical, wave physics, and beyond. The project will address the existence, stability, manipulation, and dynamics of vortex configurations in 2D and 3D settings from a novel and broad perspective. The PIs' plan is to develop effective lower dimensional, reduced evolution equations to gain novel insights on the properties of these coherent structures in the original, high-dimensional, models and to compare the theoretical results therefrom with numerical computations and circling all the way back to direct observations from atomic and polariton BEC experiments. The main goals of this proposal are multi-fold and include the following themes: the creation, removal, and interactions of vortices and soliton filaments and experimentally tailored external potentials by leveraging effective lower-dimensional dynamical models for the evolution of soliton filaments coupled with point-vortex models including the relevant case of open quantum systems in the presence of driving and damping for polariton condensates. Also, in close synergy with experimental collaborators, the study of the timely theme of synthetic magnetic monopoles and the elusive so-called Alice ring in spinor (chiefly F=2) BECs. The project aims to shed light on this highly complex, topological pattern forming system and, in particular, on the recent collaborator experiments where they observed that monopole instabilities give rise to topological patterns reminiscent of Alice rings.

RUI: Quantum Information of Interference Features in Transport,"Erwin Schrödinger stated that quantum entanglement is ""the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought."" Quantum entanglement, which requires coherence between quantum states, is fundamental to quantum information science (QIS) and quantum thermodynamics. These fields leverage unique quantum properties to sense, encode, manipulate, and transmit information in ways classical systems cannot. Although QIS has made significant progress with operational quantum computers and sensors, it still faces major challenges, including refining algorithms, improving error-correction techniques, and enhancing system stability and scalability. This award supports research and educational efforts to develop an alternative nonequilibrium transport formulation to address these critical challenges, focusing on controlling decoherence and realizing scalable quantum machines through chemical design. By studying the relationship between quantum coherence, entanglement, and information from the perspective of transport and nanostructure symmetry, this research hopes to significantly advance the QIS field, potentially leading to breakthroughs in information processing and transmission, benefiting society and enhancing national technological capabilities. Undergraduate students at Illinois State University (ISU) will be directly involved in all aspects of the research, gaining hands-on experience in modern theoretical and computational approaches. This project will contribute to the preparation of the next generation of scientists, ensuring continued progress and national competitiveness in QIS. At its core, quantum information science (QIS) seeks to harness the unique properties of quantum mechanics, particularly coherence and entanglement, to develop novel methods for encoding, manipulating, and transmitting information. Despite significant progress, QIS remains in its early stages and faces many technical and practical challenges. In quantum mechanics, different observables often highlight various aspects of the same problem. Typically, QIS concepts are often understood in terms of wavefunctions. This project proposes an alternative approach using nonequilibrium quantum transport theory to advance our understanding of quantum interference and entanglement as QIS resources, focusing on controlling decoherence and realizing scalable quantum machines through chemical structure. The proposed research will address the following problems: (1) Determining the information content of quantum interference features in transport, including the influence of dephasing and the ability to scale and manipulate information using molecular structure; and (2) Developing and simulating experimentally viable systems to measure the information content, such as through apparent 2nd law violations and the onset of Fourier’s Law. To address these challenges, state-of-the-art theoretical and computational tools will be developed, combining non-equilibrium Green's functions with statistical mechanics and many-body electronic structure theories. This research is expected to provide new insights into the fundamental aspects of interacting nonequilibrium quantum systems and quantum information, establishing alternative strategies to address longstanding challenges in QIS.

LEAPS-MPS: Eigenvalue approximation via effective potentials,"This interdisciplinary program encompasses mathematics, quantum physics, and material science research. Obtaining a rigorous understanding of physical behavior, such as quantum transport, dynamics, and superconductivity, is one of the major goals of modern mathematical physics. It has applications in condensed matter physics and material science. This project aims to study the localization properties of electron matter waves in disordered media via hidden quantum objects. Theoretical and numerical techniques will be designed to identify localized states in disordered semiconductor models and the related areas of materials design and characterization. The project will provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations and support education and diversity through the supervision of undergraduate research.

One goal is to establish the theoretical framework of eigenvalue approximation via a hidden effective potential. The project also studies the problem numerically, demonstrating the computational efficiency and accuracy of the eigenvalue approximation. More general results are expected for general graph operators. Another project goal is to study the evolution of a quantum particle subject to stochastic fluctuations.

Dynamical and Spatial Asymptotics of Large Disordered Systems,"This project will study the asymptotic behaviors of several stochastic models in probability theory, in terms of long-time dynamics and static spatial limits. These models find wide applications in various disciplines, including condensed matter physics, material science, computer science, and biology, in the study of objects such as quantum particles in disordered media, the growth of bacterial colonies, traffic flow, and the kinetic theory of gases. A focus is to understand universality, the phenomenon where microscopically different probabilistic models produce the same limiting behavior. This project also contains educational components, including curriculum development and supporting K-12 extracurricular math programs. The specific models to be investigated fall into three categories. The first is the Anderson model described by the lattice Schrödinger equation with i.i.d. random potentials. The main objective is to mathematically establish the localization phenomenon, where wave packets do not spread. The principal investigator (PI) plans to carry out comprehensive studies of this model under reduced regularity assumptions. The second theme of this project is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality, which describes the scaling limit of various random growth processes. In the past quarter-century, enormous progress has been made on those with exact-solvable structures. The PI will use geometric and probabilistic methods to study the asymptotics of several such exactly-solvable models, including local environment limits and scaling limits under large deviation, and a limiting random geometry termed the directed landscape. The ultimate goal is to extend KPZ universality beyond exact-solvability. The third topic concerns Gibbs samplers, which are Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms used to sample high-dimensional distributions. The focus is on the continuous state space setting, where tools to analyze time evolution are relatively limited. A particular instance is Kac's walk from kinetic theory, whose order of mixing time was only determined in recent years. The PI plans to develop a general framework to understand the mechanism behind the evolution of these Gibbs samplers, and prove predicted cutoffs for them.

Modeling the impact of artificial intelligence auto-segmentation-guided treatment margin reduction on the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: an in silico validation study,"BackgroundLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Approximately 25% of lung cancers present as locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) combined with chemotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy is the standard treatment for inoperable or unresectable LA-NSCLC. When delivering RT, safety treatment margins need to be applied to account for microscopic disease extent and the complex spatial uncertainties. These result in spillover radiation to normal organs at risk (OAR), thus causing excess toxicities and potentially decreasing survival. Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is a promising strategy to reduce toxicities by continuous monitoring of tumor and surrounding tissues during the course of RT and making timely adjustments to the treatment plan. However, the implementation of ART for LA-NSCLC patients into clinical practice is hampered by the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of repeat imaging and manually outlining the tumor and OARs, also known as segmentation. However, nowadays patients are routinely being positioned for RT using so-called cone-beam computer tomography (CBCT) scans which are non-diagnostic quality CT scans obtained on the RT treatment machine. These are generally insufficient in image quality to accurately outline the tumor and OARs. Automatic computer-driven segmentation algorithms for diagnostic quality scans do exist and are continuously improving. However, none of them are adequate for segmentation based on CBCTs. Since CBCTs are routinely acquired for patient positioning, autosegmentation based on these images would take advantage of readily available images that are not otherwise used. The team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has developed novel artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as the deep learning-based “Cross-Modality Educed Learning” (CMEDL) which uses MRI and CT images to inform an algorithm that allows fast and accurate auto-segmentation of target volumes and OARs. This published CMEDL algorithm is currently being extended for auto-segmentation based on CBCTs. We expect that CMEDL will improve auto-segmentation accuracy based on CBCT, allowing fast and reliable auto-segmentation for quick and more precise verification of target coverage in each fraction, facilitating ART with reduced treatment margins for safer and more effective treatments. This will also obviate the need for additional imaging for the purposes of ART and introduce what could be called AI-guided RT (AIGRT).HypothesisThe hypothesis of this project is that longitudinal AI auto-segmentation using CMEDL on weekly CBCTs during RT for LA-NSCLC decreases geometric uncertainties in localizing the tumor and OARs and can thus facilitate smaller treatment margins. The resulting decrease in dose to surrounding healthy tissues could reduce the risk of side effects, while target coverage and thus local tumor control are maintained or even improved, compared with conventional treatment margins. Since the internal anatomy during a course of RT is dynamic, real-time dose accumulation maps would allow for confirmation of actually delivered RT dose and allow for dose adjustments during the treatment course as necessary.MethodsA multi-institutional dataset of CT scans from lung cancer patients from a Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset (N total = 380, weekly CBCTs for up to 6 weeks, resulting in a total of 1200 CBCT scans) will be used to measure the geometric accuracy and segmentation variability of CBCT-CMEDL auto-segmentation compared to ground truth segmentations by human experts. The Hausdorff distance (HD) values will be used to derive a treatment margin reflecting potential setup accuracy: the AIGRT-margins. A dataset of prospectively acquired CTs from MSK of (N = 200) with biopsy-proven unresected stage II-III LA-NSCLC, treated with definitive intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) will be used to estimate the impact of the smaller AIGRT-margins compared with standard margins on the probability of toxicity and tumor control. On this dataset, treatment plans will be created using deep learning auto-planning software developed at MSK based on 1) the smaller AIGRT-margins and 2) standard margins. The radiation dose to tumor and OARs derived from these two scenarios will be used to estimate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for acute esophagitis, radiation pneumonitis and mortality due to heart-related irradiation, as well as tumor control probability (TCP), using published prediction models.StatisticsGeometric accuracy of CBCT-CMEDL tumor and OAR auto-segmentation will be computed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), surface DSC (SDSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and HD metrics. Dosimetric metrics derived from the dose volume histograms (DVH) will also be computed to evaluate segmentations and determine geometric accuracy. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) will be used for comparing NTCP/TCP prediction differences. Statistical comparisons for segmentations and NTCP/TCP model accuracies will be performed using paired and two-sided Wilcoxon tests, with adjustments for multiple comparisons where applicable. Confidence levels > 95% will be considered significant.Relevance of projectAIGRT by means of CBCT-CMEDL auto-segmentation could improve the safety and efficacy of RT for LA-NSCLC patients. To confirm this, the results of this validation study will directly inform the design of a prospective randomized clinical trial, comparing acute toxicity in LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy with or without AIGRT and reduced treatment margins. The CBCT-CMEDL method will be made available through an open-source software platform and could therefore be integrated into clinical practice without additional costs for the health care system, given that CBCTs are readily available in most Swiss and European radiation oncology departments and regularly applied during RT for image guidance.",94207,2024,2025,Swiss National Science Foundation,Switzerland,Switzerland,Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Medical and Biological Physics
Spectral Asymptotics of Laplace Eigenfunctions,"The research project falls within the field of spectral asymptotics, which studies the behavior of high-frequency Laplace eigenfunctions on manifolds (surfaces and spaces with curvature). The physical analogues of eigenfunctions are standing waves, and the eigenvalues may be thought of as their corresponding frequencies. The interdependence between high-frequency eigenfunctions and the geometry of the manifold on which they live is central to a broad range of fields from quantum physics to number theory. Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-state solutions to the Schrödinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of, say, two squares. This project aims to develop new tools to advance understanding in spectral asymptotics, whose interconnectedness to seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and science make its study particularly valuable. As part of the research project, the PI intends to develop and use tools from microlocal analysis and the theory of Fourier integral operators to refine a variety of formulas describing the behavior of high-frequency eigenfunctions, and in particular describing what effect the underlying geometry has on these formulas. The PI intends to make advancements towards a conjecture on the remainder term of the Weyl law for products of manifolds, to develop a general multilinear theory of Fourier integral operators for use in both spectral asymptotics and geometric measure theory, and to further explore the connection between spectral quantities and the presence of corresponding geometric configurations in the manifold.

NSF-BSF: Study of Radiation Hard Materials and AI Analysis Methods for LHC Reaction Plane Detectors,"Each year, the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at the European Laboratory for Nuclear and Particle Physics, CERN, in Geneva Switzerland collect data from high energy collisions of lead ions (Pb-Pb collisions). The colliding nuclei consist of protons and neutrons, which in turn are composite objects of quarks. For example, a proton contains two up-quarks and one down-quark. Quarks are bound together in protons and neutrons through the strong nuclear force, mathematically described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The force is mediated through the exchange of gluons as force carrier particles. In the overlap region of the nuclear collision, protons and neutrons are destroyed and leave behind the so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a form of pure quark matter that existed in the microseconds immediately following the Big Bang at the beginning of the Universe. The reaction products of Pb-Pb collisions in the CERN detectors (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) often produce QGP. The observation of the final state particles makes it possible to characterize the properties of the QGP and in this way increases our understanding of the fundamental matter in the early universe. The research funded through this grant will result in radiation resistant materials and machine learning algorithms that are needed to use the ATLAS Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) and the ATLAS Reaction Plane Detector (RPD) to determine the geometry of the Pb-Pb collision system. The researchers supported by this award will measure both, the magnitude of the overlap of the colliding nuclei as well as the orientation of the nuclear collision system with respect to the ATLAS detector systems. The RPD and ZDC are located in a radiation environment that inflicts severe radiation damage to materials. For example, most optical materials will lose their light transmission after just a few weeks of usage. This group will test different advanced fused silica materials for use as optical media in the active detection elements of RPDs and ZDCs. They will also study different radiation resistant photomultiplier tubes that will be used to readout the Cherenkov created in the active detection elements of the RPDs and ZDCs. Furthermore, the group will develop advanced machine learning algorithms that will be used to analyze the RPD data and to extract the orientation angle of the Pb-Pb collisions system with respect to the ATLAS detector. The advanced radiation resistant materials and the machine learning algorithms developed for ATLAS will be also used by CMS ZDCs and RPDs and for future experiments at the Electron Ion Collider, EIC, at Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL, on Long Island, NY. In the laboratories at UIUC and Ben Gurion University more than 12 graduate and undergraduate students will work on the R&D for the RPDs and ZDCs. In addition, the laboratories host undergraduate summer students from 4-year colleges and high school student interns. Students will be trained in the Physics of the QGP, instrumentation for high radiation environments, advanced machine learning algorithms and collaborative research in large, international collaborations. The radiation-resistant detectors and materials developed in this project are expected to have applications in other fields, such as dose monitoring in radiation oncology, use for space-based instrumentation and radiation monitoring in response to nuclear accidents. The project will use unique irradiation facilities at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center in Israel and in the LHC tunnel at CERN that have been used to identify radiation-hard Cherenkov radiator materials for the present ATLAS and CMS ZDCs and RPDs. The project also will make use of state-of-the-art materials research facilities, such as MRL at UIUC and laboratories at Ben Gurion University. The work on Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) will start from the current ATLAS RPD MLAs and expand to include data from the ZDCs in order to characterize the event geometry of heavy ion collisions. The MLA applications will be developed and tested on DeltaAI at UIUC NCSA, the most performant GPU computing resource in NSF’s portfolio. The unique radiation facilities and the project expertise with MLAs will then be used to evaluate technology choices and materials for EIC forward detectors, for the ePIC electromagnetic calorimeter.

Observational Signatures of Cosmic Strings,"This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum in the Tufts Institute of Cosmology at Tufts University. Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or possibly even fundamental objects of cosmological length which may or may not exist in our universe. If they exist, they may play a role in the generation of dark matter. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window into fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory. The best hope for discovering a cosmic string network is through observation of gravitational waves. The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) and other pulsar timing arrays have found strong evidence for a gravitational wave background formed by many sources throughout the universe. These sources could be pairs of giant black holes, but they could also be cosmic string loops. Professor Olum will study the gravitational waves that would be emitted by cosmic strings and compare them with current and forthcoming NANOGrav observations. His work will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in the recent and rapidly growing field of gravitational waves and their possible sources, and in learning about fundamental physics at very high energies. Professor Olum will involve graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the work and thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature. More technically, Professor Olum will use the gravitational wave spectra that he and his group have derived from a realistic population of cosmic string loops evolving under gravitational self-interaction to compare with pulsar timing observations from the NANOGrav collaboration (of which he is a full member) and the international pulsar timing array. He will develop a new technique for simulation of axion strings using the Kalb-Ramond formalism, and so improve the calibration of axion dark matter densities. He will study the velocities acquired by loops in reaction to anisotropic gravitational wave emission, called ""the rocket effect"", to determine how much cosmic string loops cluster in galaxies, which is important for other possible observational mechanisms.

Collaborative Research: RUI: Enabling direct imaging radio telescopes and precision cosmology with pyFHD,"A new generation of large radio telescopes are being developed to study how and when the first stars and galaxies formed, understand our evolving universe, and explain the behavior of our sun and solar system. These telescopes will have many more antennas than previous radio telescopes. A new technique has been developed to significantly reduce the data rates from such large telescopes. Under this grant, the investigators will add functionality to the open source pyFHD software package. The investigators will test this software with data collected from several radio telescopes including both traditional and direct imaging systems. These software enhancements will be made widely available to the entire radio astronomy community, facilitating and encouraging additional contributions to the package. In addition, this grant will support EPIC TV, giving the public a real-time view of the radio sky as seen by the Long Wavelength Array in New Mexico. This project will provide research experiences for non-traditional undergraduate students that are not well served by standard research opportunities. This will include enabling these students on a path to graduate school, with a goal to diversify the broader STEM workforce. Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD) was developed in the 21cm cosmology community that solves many of the analysis challenges encountered in that research area. It has been used in obtaining leading limits of the 21cm Epoch of Reionization power spectrum, demonstrating that it has the precision required for cosmology, as well as being used to make high-quality catalogs and polarized maps of galactic emission. FHD, originally written in IDL (the Interactive Data Language), shares a mathematical framework with direct imaging, making it well placed to help address the data analysis challenges for direct imaging telescopes. Recently, in a major development effort, the minimal set of FHD functionality required for a standard cosmology analysis was ported to python, resulting in the open source pyFHD package. The functionality the investigators will develop in pyFHD under this grant will enable the community to demonstrate the science performance of direct imaging radio telescopes with a full end-to-end pipeline. This will provide the community with a reference implementation of the software needed to perform science without interferometric visibilities and will facilitate evaluation for future proposals to construct direct imaging radio telescopes.
